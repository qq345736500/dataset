that be a classic post from easyrider ! one of his more assinine attempt at intelligent design . orion ' s folly : some other goody from that site . never link to those specific article . but before orion get too self - righteous , let us look at some ot the topic he consider ' funny ' in a link he give over at the usat creation / evolution forum : christian crime - pastor molests widow ' s boy - pastor molests adopt daughter - priest molests altar boys - late for church - christian racist kidnapper - music pastor molests - bush ' s faith - base failure - pastor molest , gun , drug - $ 400,000 miss - priest molest - church youth coach molests - bush suppress student prayer - sen byrd ' s ' white ( ' n ' word ) ' be this funny ? it ' s apparently real funny to orion . his link also have a pornographic sub - link on the virgin mary , describe her in graphic , profane language . orion - christ - denier like you and brummer need a lot of help .	1
the forum rule . 3 a ) no personal attack , insult , name call , offensive generalization , or label . i fail to see where i break any of those rule , no name be call , there be no labeling , there be no none of it . and even if there be , you do it all the time , so what make you any different . practice what you preach penfold .	0
gallileo be kill because of blasphemy of the church , say the earth go around the sun . actually , galileo wasn ' t kill . he be sentence to house arrest . and his sin be in declare that the earth move since the bible state that the earth do not move .	0
all too often those oppose to intelligent design simply reject any notion of god no matter how unemotional and rationality base that notion be . well , that ' s your claim , anyway . truth be that billion of theist accept evolutionary theory as be and reject the standard id argument .	0
this be why i do not advocate the american holocaust that have destroy nearly fifty million unborn child on the altar of `` choice `` ! shadow ' s reasoning that `` i will have a baby when i be ready `` smack of pure , unadulterated selfishness . i do not give a tinker ' s damn about the reason nor circumstance . when that child be conceive , all bet be off and the focus must be on that child ! hang in here everyone , bassman ' s be read `` _____ `` ' s post over and over and they have get him talk about the `` american holocaust `` ! emoticonxbanghead until you have be in my exact situation , i would not expect someone like you to understand . i really do not give a emoticonxcensored if you think it be selfish or not - it be not for you to judge .	1
character like our jyosh just want to diminish gay in society , and deny that gay be victim of religious homophobia . this be why he pretend that bully of gay kid be just a feature of bully in general ( as if blue - eyed kid be routinely bully because of their eye colour ! ) , rather than a direct consequence of religious bigotry . he can not bring himself to admit the truth there . as we have see in recent year , kid who be bully can become so anti - social that they become violent , and attack those who have bully them with weapon and mass murder . i be not condone this behavior , but i be not surprised that it happen . those who support the bullying of gay kid and others . well , you get what you sow .	0
what i marvel at be that you be not even embarrass to ask such an ignorant question . because if it ' s a chicken egg , and if it ' s allow to incubate to term , it sure be not go to be a crow when it hatch . and to be even more simplistic , a chicken egg be still a chicken while it ' s in the egg . just as a human be be still a human be in the womb . thats funny , because these scramble egg sure do not taste like kfc to me .	1
or by not grant them to the child you be endanger the right of the child carry by the woman . you be give her a dictatorship . and what exactly be i granting to the suit - wearing politician in washington by give them the right to revoke her ability to make these decision for herself ? i do not think dictatorship be the right word , since she be not ask for the power over anyone but herself , and her child . would you call a man dying of inoperable cancer who decide to end his chemotherapy a dictator ? or a parent who decide to remove their child from life - support ? would you rather it be a democracy ? that everytime a woman be faed with this predicament , we put it to a vote ? how about an oligarchy - where her situation be put in front of some committee who decide her fate ?	0
this make no sense . bet do not exist to be exclusive entertainment for black . it be ethno - centric programming . and not very good at that ( tv1 be well ) . for there to be a ' white ' channel , at least along the line of what bet be aim to do , there would have to be a single ' white ' culture , which there be not . and bet do not exclude white from its programming . your statement seem flat out racist to me . as i say previously , ' tookie ' s ' defender seem to be overzealous in their defense of the man ( i can only take your word for it since i really have not be pay much attention ) , but i do not see how their accusation have anything to do with hate crime , and your perception of how they be enforce . you have to be kid me . you do not really believe this , do you ? sure they may have white people on from time to time , but obviously they exclude white people since you can turn it on and almost always see only black people . so the criterion of whether something be racist or not be whether or not there be a ' single culture ' behind it ? i do not see why have a culture behind it be really relevant . thing can be racist or not independent of whether there be a culture there .	0
have you consider that there be some liberal , who be retire from their job ? be you tell me liberal have job ? you sure can not tell it by all the anti military / war protest , the flag burning , you saw prior to the start of the war and by all the libs that post here 24 / 7 . they be either unemployed or 12 year old kid out of school for summer vacation . 	1
`` that may be true , but it be not harmful so i doubt it really should be on the list . `` well that may be your contention , but medically that be not necessarily true . maybe be gay do not mean you be suicidal or depressed , but there be more of it go on in the gay life than in the hetero . that in itself be a wake up call . depression and suicide be harmful , even if it do not touch you personally . if it be as simple as you say the apa would not be re - evaluate `` reorientation therapy `` would they and with positive critique too . you would not have prominent gay activist like camile paglia deride the gay community for be malcontent when those unhappy with be gay seek and desire the way to be hetero .	0
that be because all citizen be bear here , eh ? emoticonxrolleyes where be here ? you do not seem to want to display your location . we all know there ' s more than one way to become an american citizen . that say , as an american citizen , english be the native tongue . it ' s the primary language taught in american school and it ' s how our government communicate with its citizenry . i be not really interested in debate this topic with you , it probably should be a thread unto itself . i think dono be merely point out that if you want to make a ' snippy ' reply , it carry more weight when correctly spell .	0
you keep bring up the red cross . the majority of donators to the red cross be most likely christian as well , so what ' s your point ? emoticonxconfused but be the red cross christian ? obviously most contributor be christian . that ' s obvious as most american be christian .	0
and we know this how ? you complain about the 90 % figure be erroneous and then make an unsupported statement like this ? furthermore , if mexico be make an earnest attempt to smash the cartel and we be finance it in part , would not we want to help reduce the weapon traffic flow south into the cartel ' s arsenal ? if you pay attention the batfe say so . yes but some people do not want to close the border . they prefer no border control .	0
who be this ' us ' you speak of ? you get a pet in your pocket ? your buddy gaonosa who assure us you be not a bb have abandon you it appear . perhaps he saw you as the lost cause you appear to be ? when the whole world appear to be nut , look in the mirror and you will find him emoticonxagree i be not his buddy . my objection be that you think he be english ( please tell me he ' s not ) and that your perception of english people be wrong and insulting i do not care whether american ( or should i be a prat like you and call you a yank ? ) people carry gun or not and have never support his argument . look at some of your stupid smug post i be not surprised that you need a gun for protection . look in the mirror fella and you will see penfold mk ii .	1
the english government have effectively abolish the right of englishman , confirm in their 1689 bill of right , to `` have arm for their defence , `` to be more accurate , ( not something note amongst the pro - gun rabble ) the right of protestant to have arm for their defence against catholic . i think we have all see quite enough of this `` defence `` in northern ireland .

because the constitution do not exclude us from marriage . people like you do . and , since it mean nothing to you anyway , you should just accept it . oh , but it do mean something to him . he can not / will not say what , but it sure be not base on homophobia , no siree ! it ' s just really , really important that marriage stay a striaghts only club , for reason that can not be explain , but there ' s no bigotry , do not worry on that score . emoticonxrolleyes	1
i agree with you , that ' s just plain silly . first of all we do not know if a soul even exist , and secondly , even if we have proof that it do , we have no way of know when it become reality for that person . maybe it ' s like sin , you know , a man - make concept wink you want to consider a zef a ' person ' - fine , let us apply this so - call ' logic ' across the board . if a woman should for whatever reason die while give birth , then the baby should serve a life prison sentence for murder emoticonxgood have a nice day emoticonxangel never think of that . if that `` person `` have right , do they have responsibility ? could a fetus be charge for cause toxemia ? how about sue the little tyke for give mom varicose vein and stretch mark ?	1
the truth : heston take his nra show to denver and do and say exactly what we recount movie . php ? mov = heston . from the end of my narration set up heston ' s speech in denver , with my word , `` a big pro - gun rally , `` every word out of charlton heston ' s mouth be uttered right there in denver , just 10 day after the columbine tragedy . but do not take my word – read the transcript of his whole speech heston . php . heston devote the entire speech to challenge the denver mayor and mock the mayor ' s plea that the nra `` do not come here . `` far from deliberately edit the film to make heston look bad , i choose to leave most of this out and not make heston look as evil as he actually be . . you liar . you be distort the truth the same way moore do . the truth be the nra event be plan 1 year before the killing in littleton . the truth be the nra rally be cancel excpet for the officer meeting which be require by law to not be cancel . heston say `` from my cold dead hand `` in north carolina 1 year later . and what transcript be you talk about ? the transcript be post above . what big pro - gun rally be you talk about in denver . do you mean the one that never happen ?	0
okay , well i think that you be just find reason to go against him . i think that you have some bad experiances when you be young or a while ago that make you turn on god . you be look for reason , not very good one i might add , to convince people . either way , god love you . happy here come the christian , think they can know everything by guess , and commit the genetic fallacy leave and right .	1
when it come to enable the terrorism of gun death in america , no one beat the nra | buzzflash . orgstatesman . comand now we have a nutter in washington state who assassinate four police officer while they be get ready for their next shift in a coffee shop . the nra be the father and mother of pure anarchy and lawlessness . so simone , if the shooter have instead drive his toyota prius into a crowd , kill many as a result , would you call for ban toyota priuses ?	1
an evolutionary mutation of a gene be : a new and useful gene that never b4 exist , bring new body structure and function that never b4 exist . actually , there be no such thing as `` an evolutionary mutation of a gene . `` a mutation be a mutation . for evolution to have occur require neither that a mutation be new nor useful and they do not require new structure nor structure . here ' s a little mental exercise for you . at most , a person can have only two allele for any gene . this would have be the condition of the human race 6,000 year ago accord to creationists . it would not have be possible for there to be more than 2 allele for any give gene . now consider that for every gene in the human genome there be an average of 14 different allele , sometimes more , sometimes less . where do all of those allele come from ?	0
 an ak - 47 assault rifle , a high - calibre sniper rifle and machine gun be among a large cache of weapon uncover by police in a sting operation culminate in a series of sydney raid . undercover officer buy a range of illegal gun , include the ak - 47 , over a series of month from a target supplier . in a similar raid yesterday , in powder work road , elanora height , officer seize a large cache of weapon . it include a 22 magnum revolver , a 12 - gauge shotgun , a . 410 calibre shotgun and ammunition , two . 22 calibre rifle , two lee enfield . 303 bolt - action rifle , a m6 scout dual calibre shotgun / rifle , a . 270 calibre bolt - action rifle , a . 45 calibre muzzle load rifle , a 22 - 250 calibre bolt - action rifle andxa martini action rifle . i know , maybe the american criminal will just import gun in with their mexican illegal drug . i do not know for sure but i believe the mexican drug gang would not mind another revenue stream . net result , zilch , nada , zero . but you know that ! emoticonxsmilie gun control be nothing but a scam !	1

i personally believe that abortion be murder of a defenseless , innocent , unborn infant in the womb and should not be legal unless the mother ' s life be endanger or possibly in the case of rape and incest . i believe it be the most barbaric act one human be can perpetrate on another . boy - howdy ! you have speak the truth and speak it well . welcome to you from the conservative south .	1
take the same poll in detroit and i wonder what the result would be . not the best school system there although the mayor have a nice car i hear emoticonxclown	1
family can multiply a lot fast than you think . i be not sure of the correct time , but there be nothing that say it could not have happen in that time period . the incestually conceive son go out and find other people and marry whom they please . they could have marry a woman who have child , and have even more child . then they could have return . that area that be so populated be nothing when sodom and gomorrah be destroy , and any people live around it leave . why else would lot ' s daughter commit incest to bring forth child ? except , of course , the evidence be totally against that . plus , there be the little matter of infant mortality . and lack of resource . but hey , do not let common sense and evidence stop you .	1
just because people have all sort of view on the subject do not mean that there be not a right answer . well it all depend on who be go to determine `` right `` , be not it ? abortion be not math . there be no finite answer . just a myriad of opinion which inevitable lead to either abortion be right or abortion be wrong . no different now then when roe v wade become law or any other time in history . i do like aristotle ' s take ; he teach that a fetus originally have a vegetable soul but he do not say what kind of vegetable .	0
sure they would . their belief do not confirm or deny the validity of the resurrection . it show traditionally the die for him , but there be only hearsay evidence that be the case . if belief be all that be necessary i have a friend who need some help get some money out of nigeria . interested in make some quick tax free money ? originally post by easyrider would they have die for a lie , if christ be not resurrect ? not likely . like i say , i doubt that very much .	0
very interesting , cuz i be bear in liberal democratic boston mass to a sunni moslem mother and a shiite moslem father and yet here i be a right wing , bear again conservative republican christian . and have be a right wing think and conservative even before i accept jesus as my savior . weird huh ? i guess your little geographical generalization forget to take into account the individual free will that each of us posse . be there many liberal democrat leave wing think bear again christian ? weird huh ?	1
anyone who do not like insurance premium be free not to pay them which be why 50 million american be uninsured , include 9 million child . with 27,000 from that group die every year , as a result of `` freedom `` , and unpaid hospital bill the lead cause of bankruptcy and homelessness . also for the other 50 million who be underinsured .	1
of course , we also need to note that the rise and fall of abortion rate be not necessarily link to who be president at the time . clinton give access to b / c which be know to prevent pregnancy . bush have reduce access to b / c ( include e / c ) . a primary reason for aborting be money - american have be less well off under bush .	0
no just the word i use . i be curious about the intelligible , never be a big fan of alice in wonderland . well uh i be a fan . & you remind me of humpty dumpty .	1
obviously , you can not please everyone ! that be just a story of one person . why do not you cite the statement of million of iraqi who praise our help in remove their totalitarian leader ? actually the kid be on a panel , all pretty much say the same thing . why do not you cite them ?	0
i agree . it ' s just too bad sometimes with young adult they do not think about what might happen , they just respond with natural urge . and this result sometimes be someone become `` with child `` even though it be not what they set out to do ! so should we force them to have the child and put it up for adoption ? if so consider there be lot of child wait to be take in and most of them be not infant . i do not think we have any business force anyone to do something they do not want to do . the father be supply his dna when he engage in sexual relation . after than point he have in effect sign a blank check . it ' s like the old saw , if you do not want to do the time , do not do the crime . father to be should not be engage in sex unless they intend to pony up with the montly check . i come from a bit of a bias on this subject because this be my area of endeavor for some 20 + year .	0
what be suppose to take thousnds / million of year for population of animal to evolve have just take a swift punch to the gut by david reznick . well , yes . eleven year be quite swift , but it actually support the theory of evolution through natural selection . the estimate of the speed of evolution that you seem to be depend on be do by george gaylord simpson way back in the 1 9 4 0 s or 1 9 5 0 s . since then , we have observe fruit fly , as well as other specimen , to evolve quite rapidly , show significant evolution in only a decade or so . more recently , however , scientist have be able to observe evolution in natural setting and have find that it can sometimes be quite rapid when environmental change be rapid . besides the study that reznick do on guppy , there be also the study of the galapagos finch by the grant , and study of anole lizard in the bahamas . these be observable phenotypical change , not speciation event .	0
his method appear to be good , i . e . use observation and experimental data , as well as repeatability . not sure how you can tell that since very little be mention about his method .	0
certainly , because with calm empathy you can casually address such a matter simply because the struggle do not pertain to you personally . to be able to put into question the love of another human be be simply not only alarm in nature , but damn to the very definition of love , equality , and freedom in creation of man . and to trump this as a question of morality only serve as a mask to curtail the prejudice objection one personally have to a ceremony , right , and relationship that person will not even be personally affect by . it be bad then that they just do not get it . once you put some civil right on the ballot nothing be off limit . freedom of speech , religion , assembly ect . they be all up to be vote out of existence for an unpopular minority by the majority . they just do not get it .	0
who say anything about rape ? peter tatchell , a british gay activist advocate the age of consent be change to 14 year old . you see all the straight people know that whatever ther gay get , they will want more . and you just prove it . do he say it should only be lower for gay relationship ? probably not . be there straight people who would advocate for change the age of consent ? yes . there be different argument for and against lower the age of consent which have nothing to do with gay equality right .	0
ah , another proponent of nastiness . say hello to your hitler - love brother in pinson , alabama , mike vanderboegh . never hear of him . however , look like those ever - love proponent of free speech up in canada show anne coulter that ' free - speech ' be only what liberal make it to be . 	1
i be use to read non sequiturs from you , but how on earth you imagine this follow in any way from the post you quote eludes me completely . be north korea a bastion of peace and good - living ? nope . be it religious ? nope . therefore obstacle to ' peace ' do not necessarily have to be tie in with religiosity . hope that ' s spell out enough for you . try to keep up .	1
so of you pro - choice people confuse the heck out of me . you go on and on about a woman ' s choice when it come to her body and how everyone else should stay the heck out of her business but then when people want to own weapon for personal defense / usuage . people that have not commit crime and have be physiologically examine . you go : no ! that ' s wrong ! you can not have your choice ! i be be affect by it ! ( even when its obvious no you be not be effect by their choice to bear arm ) and you lot call pro - lifer hypocritical for be pro - death penalty . pfft . ah ? `` scratch head `` i just wake up , what ? womens choice , her body , death penalty ? ah ok gotch ya . emoticonxfrazzled	1
no it ' s not . a embryo do not have a developed brain or in the early stage a brain at all . therefore its mental existance be the same as a plant . a fetus be not a embryo . learn your term . i be under the impression that he be reference the video . since he always interchange the word embryo and fetus i just roll with it . secondly , an embryo do have instruction for a brain . while a plant do not . i guess the answer hear depend on the ever evolve definition of `` mental existence `` .	1
i have to disagree with 1 and 3 . if god exists , and he want his existence proven , he could prove it . likewise , if he want to have an impact , he could . i will agree with 1 and 3 if you add `` as thing stand now `` , or word to that effect . we can not prove the existence of god for , by definition , he dwell in a reality outside our own . similarly , i can not prove the existence of a fly shoe in hyperspace , nor can i disprove it , but i can prove that the fly shoe do not exist in our world because it exist , by definition , in hyperspace . i can make up anything i want and say it exist in another universe . a round square , a colorless green idea that sleep furiously , you name it .	0
definitely . it never occur to me , me a person who wonder why god do not just stop rape , that because he can not exist in all world that he ' s not omnipotent . i like see your argument . would you consider yourself philosophical ? would you consider yourself philosophical ? no , i do not think philosophy be useful . everything they claim that can not be support by science be simple word game , like the ontological argument . lolzor be the first person i have discuss philosophy with ever , and i be not impressed with philosophy ' s lack of demonstrative capability .	0
creationism start with a conclusion , and find data to support it . accord to the scientific method , one be suppose to look at data , and draw a conclusion from it . therefore , creationism be not science , and need not take any scientific consideration . the end . be say that ever since the first time i hear about creationsism .	0
um , that would be murder , which be against the law and do harm the person be murder . a union between 2 mutually loving people do not even begin to compare to that . how about small cute animal ? whare be the line of what religion allow , and law forbids ? we know it be not where harm come to another person , or poligamy would be legal	1

rovdak , be you forget that ivf and cloning technology be abortive technology ? so much b . where should i start ? eugenics be about manipulate genome of population . since when be most abortion perform for the purpose of lower or raise the frequency of certain allele or trait in population ? if a woman want to maximize her life , liberty , and happiness , and she feel that she can best do so by abort a pregnancy , your intended prevention of that action ' fly in the face of the declaration of independence ' . ( not that the declaration have any legal standing . ) whether an embryo or fetus be human be irrelevant . no thing , human or not , have the right to subsist completely on a human without the latter ' s consent . ' abortive technology ' ? you sound like falwell , insist that clone destroys life when it do nothing of the sort . please explain your laughable statement .	1
it get bad . i go to a presentation of creation science once and this 80 year old `` archaeologist `` tell me that before the flood , the atmospheric pressure of the planet be double what it be now and that the oxygen content be high . oh never mind that such a condition would be toxic . not to mention that no ice core support such magical idea .	0

he be declare war on an unclean people whom he command the jew to wipe out in a time of war . and if god be so against kill the unborn , why do he fail to make an exception for the pregnant woman ? if you allege that the biblical god be totally against kill the unborn , why do he tell him to kill all of the non - virgin woman ? i bet you will not answer the question and just rely on insult as an attempt to cover up your argumentative failure as you always do . see my signature for example .	0

you be so right - on in what you say ! in a sunday school at a church i formerly attend , an elder of the church remark that his `` faith be strengthen `` by the `` evidence `` afford by recent archaeological discovery in the middle east . in a tone i now rather regret , i blurt out two thing . how weak be your faith before ? and . if the `` evidence `` have go ' the other way , ' would your faith then have be weaken ? his answer for the second question be a simple ' no , ' which suggest to me that the sense of the term ' evidence ' he be employ be not the same sense you ' d expect a scientist to use . his response to the first be problematic , and interesting . `` my faith , `` he say , have always be - - then he use the most interesting word - - `` complete . `` but he have take sufficient offence already , it seem , that i press no further . i wish sometimes that i ' d ask : if your faith be `` always complete , `` do the archaeological evidence make it `` more complete `` ? and , if so , do your sense of ' complete ' match that word ' s usual application ? i do not quite grasp the notion of there be `` scientific evidence `` for a proposition within the realm of faith . i do not mean to suggest that my claim that scientific and religious proposition reside in different discourse disposes of all worry or complaint . activity in one realm may be felt in the other . but , re : evolution , i think this . give convince evidence that , say , the earth be billion of year old , not thousand - - a mound of evidence more than high enough for my need - - my worry be not that the ' biblical account ' of creation be wrong , erroneous , falsify . but rather be the quite different worry of wonder what , now , that account ' s meaning be , what it affirm . scientific discovery , evidence , and discourse thus do not `` disprove the bible . `` rather , they serve to displace interpretation of biblical text , and give us cause - - i call it : opportunity - - to find new , rich meaning in scripture . i be often embarrass by the smallness and brittleness of certain christian ' interpretation . emphasize the ' literal , ' as some do - - a very problematic term in itself - - some christian see in , for example , the genesis `` tree of the knowledge of good and evil `` nothing more than a tree . a biological tree . pear tree . peach tree . apple tree . tree of the knowledge of good and evil . albeit a special specie , nonetheless a specie . and , for them , there you go - - eve chowed down on the fruit of a proscribed specie , and that ' s your story . lose , in the insistence upon and closing of that interpretation , be the richness of metaphor the story offer . metaphor , again and again , be variously deliberately denigrate or unconsciously eclipse , in the reading of certain christian . science be not the only victim of such cheesily ' literal ' interpretation . christian faith - - at least , the possibility of a rich faith robustly aware of its own weight in metaphor , parable , legend and myth , and the transformative power that arise from those aspect of scripture - - be equally victim . i feel more sadness about such a limited believer ' s faith than i do about that person ' s science . master_shake , for your poignantly apt remark - - `` what they have be not faith at all `` - - thanks . bless you ! brad you can have reason faith , but it need not rely on ' empirical ' evidence . there be very many form of evidence .	0

the legalization of same - sex marriage ( or marriage - like civil union or domestic partnership ) would severely damage the public institution of marriage . it would send a false message that same - sex union be equivalent to marriage , that same - sex relation and marriage contribute equally to society and provide equal potential for individual and social integrity , stability and happiness . it would convey the false message that whatever private sexual relationship adult choose deserve the same legal treatment as traditional marriage . legalize same - sex marriage would create enormous conflict and confusion in the law and among legal system . do you have any evidence of this that doean ' t come from a biased christian website ? so here be where you be say nanny , nannie , poo , poo my straight realtionship be good than your gay relationship . how ? some big claim , can you provide some substance to them , in other word can you back this up with some data ? that do not come from some christian baised study .	0

apparently gay marriage be more threatening than unmarried gay couple be . the point about legalize gay household be certainly puzzle unless one contend that cohabitation be illegal ( which it be not ) . but just in case i be wrong , perhaps the authority should be notify of all the heterosexual unmarried couple and they should be haul off to jail . oh cc , apparently , 10 % of the population have the power to destroy the other 90 % somehow . we can not be in the military because we have the power to undermine thing , we can not get married cause we will destroy marriage for everyone , we can not possibly have commit relationship because it would make britney look bad ( although , i have her beat by 4 year and counting , still happy and go ) we have the power . we be gay , ten percent take out the other 90 % or so they say ( ask jaaman for more info )	1

i have never hear anyone use the phrase , `` i be a human `` . right afford born people need not descend from religiously inspire `` belief system `` . your belief that a fetus deserve the same right as fully develop people do . in fact all your argument always flow from this presumption . any belief system be a religion loosely define . i ' d like to know how you think right be afford to bear person if not by a belief system or at the very least a belief in natural right . either way , that do not address the point i have . if i can not impose my belief on you then who you be to impose your belief of me not hurt chemist99a ?	0

the only reason that it will be a mac be because of the information that be still inside of the computer that should be remove if you want to take the whole brain . you have to remember that the human mind be not just a hard drive . it be also the processor ( brain ) as well as the motherboard ( connector of input and output ) and the ram ( short term memory ) . there be nothing else in the human body that can better fit the role of any of these four component . this be also the core of what determine if a computer be a mac or a pc . if you take all these piece from your pc and put them in a mac then you have a pc . this be the case since you will be able to run pc - only application and not mac - only application . well , the actual personality of the computer be in the hard drive . ram really be not anything but a notebook , and the motherboard be more of a nervous system . so the processor and hardrive be the mind - the processor be the modivator , and the hard drive be the memory . if i be to take the intel p3 out and place an athlon tong 3000 + in it ' s place , would the computer be a different computer ? no . it would be the same computer .	0

you can preach pretty religious philosophy all day long but i ain ' t buying . say that jesus tell you that all life be special do not comfort a rape victim , do not provide health care to a woman without it , do not fee a family if a single mom have to quit her job , do not provide an education if she have to quit school . reduce woman to pretty quote that be hang in your kitchen do not mean squat out in here in the real world , and it do not indicate that you get it , let alone care . just cause you dont buy it doesnt mean it be not true . that life be sacred do provide a ( if not the only ) compel altruistic basis for and responsibility to social justice whether it be actually walk out or not . i think that the fact that it be not really walk out in america prof that the majority of american be not pro life ( include a majority of those who actually claim to be pro life ) . this doesnt negate the truth though .	0
you would be destroy whole generation to come . ( that baby lead to more baby . ) so , if there be a way to know that that baby would be infertile it would be alright in your view to abort ?	0
i would disagree here about this , in term of the pro - life view . it ' s not that mental existence be irrelevant . quite the contrary ; in fact it ' s the reality that there will soon be mental existence that make it matter . i do not think the issue of abortion should ever be divorce from the reality that the embryo will likely grow into a human be . a human that be human by pretty much anyone ' s standard . so i suspect that the big difference here be that pro - choicers be more `` in the moment `` in term of the way they view the fetus , and pro - lifer be more `` long - term big - picture `` in term of the way they view the fetus . certainly the likely potential of what the fetus grow into have a lot to do with the pro - life position on whether it be truly human . but growth be fairly irrelevant . my sperm can grow into a human too , and have mental existence , yet ejaculate be not murder . it just become a huge debate on where to draw the line , therefore it be best to focus on the state that it be right now . not what it be or could possibly be . that seem reasonable to me .

i agree , but when you know your opponent will succeed in make you look weak if you give them the chance , try to look like the big man will do jack for you . i know i be the big man , the only reason for publicly display my moral high roadedness on an internet forum be to prove myself , but if i know my opponent will use it as leverage against me then there ' s really no point . on an internet forum why be that so important ? the big man usually need not find it necessary to prove he be , but be secure in his knowledge he be or be big enough to realize when he be not and adjust accordingly . my guess be this be not the only place this happen . these thing happen , you fall , you get up , people laugh , you move on , you see someone fall you can laugh or help them up . just depend on who you want to be . sorry i be a sucker for empty milk crate . can not seem to walk by one without jump on and take her for a spin .	0
just read the following story . my question be thus , should this child be put to death per bible base rule govern a child ' s unruleiness ? you know , if the god denier even let the baby out of the mother ' s womb alive to begin with then he ' s already one step ahead of the game . as for what to do with him then , show me under the new covenant where jesus say to stone kid ? personally , i think we should stone obese , jaded statue of weird look holy men .	1
gay sex be a sin then also . why do you think all of the state use to outlaw sodomy , and where do you think they get that from ? listen , go back 50 and 100 year and find me one major denomination that approve of gay sex sin , and then look at what bibles they be use . it should become clear after that . whoosh . emoticonxbye that be the sound of my point as it go over your head . how much do you want to but i do not find any ? go ahead bet me ! be you afraid ?	1
in the name of all that be evil and unholy . jyoshu - i have never say that the civil right movement of black and gay be identical ! not once ! but you sure do not hesitate to portray them that way when you use one to bolster the other ! or when you fail to actually ( gasp ) qualify the matter by note the difference as well as the similarity . hey , it ' s just accuracy , so why get in a fuss over it , huh ? emoticonxrolleyes why not go ahead and invoke the jewish genocide while you be at it , or call anyone who have a different opinion `` hitler ? `` i mean it ' s the same sort of generalization .	1
i be not sure we be talk about the same thing . the guarantee of a particular form of government be a far cry from specify every liberty the state must protect . perhaps you can clarify the connection . flip back to page 9 and do try to keep up . i be not go to spam the board for the weak link .	1
' what i find most interesting ' be to consider a humanity purge of the chronic scourge of rabid religion . how much more pleasant , and saner would the world be . and how many indigenous people around the planet would have continue to survive and thrive unmolested by what i consider the evilest of all manmade plague , religion . but the question be can you prove your belief system be true ? and all you have do be spew hate for religion but have not even try to actually answer the question . and ask yourself this . if the idea of god be such a man make plague , then god do not even exist right ? so if god do not exist then what have he do to you to make you so venomous and angry at him ? why would you be so angry at a non existent be ? i challenge you to come up with a rational answer .	1
you be against it for reason of your personal religious belief , because marriage be a `` sacrament `` . this be not the only group who have a different idea on the sacrament of marriage , or believe in a different type of god or no god , as i point out earlier . however , it be gay that should not be accomodated ? i be against polygamy , marriage with underaged minor and marriage to livestock as well , so do not feel that you be the only one not `` accomodated `` .	1
well , apparently the above 3 poster think iraq and the cause of say war be the most important thing to worry about . sad , but i think they miss your point . i do not see it as what issue be america facing , but what issue be the individual american people face . in my opinion , the issue most important to the individual person be the same as they have be for thousand of year . food , shelter , security from people and thing try to kill them , and their individual mean to obtain these thing . just a thought . do you believe the average individual actually have any personal control over provide basic essential and security ? most individual exist from proceeds of a ' job ' or government program and would be lose without one or the other , of which they generally have no actual influence . i find it difficult to accept that the average , individual us citizen have the brain power to be concern about anything but what ' s on tv . voter apathy of 25 % or less participation in municipal election be a strong indication of individual need to be manipulate as govern power see fit .	0
my college room - mate be southern and i love her to death . coddle around hunter all you want . he try to demonize an entire musical genre ( that he probably do not listen to and know nothing about ) - and well , music be my blood , so that tick me off . secondly - he be not only racist - in other post he have prove himself quite a bit sexist . quite threaten by woman who have dream big than wash his underwear this one . i be a woman - so that be strike , too . as a music , love woman of a non - white child - this guy offend me on many personal level . he feel no call to be pc - and neither do i . boy - howdy ! why do not you let me know how you really feel ? i have not try to demonize anything . rap music do that to itself without any help from me . rap be the low form of music that i have ever hear . it be just too primative for my taste . once again , i be not a racist , nor be i sexist . i do my own washing . i wish you and your child nothing but the best in life . some folk think that expose young child to rap music be a form of child abuse , i agree with those folk . p.s . tell that southern girl to find another room - mate , you sound like a horrible role model . well , get to go wash some more underwear .	1

our local school district rent out school bus to group and rent build facility out for event all the time . it be smart . they have the resource on hand and it provide a little extra money for the district . grant that explanation do not fit your agenda , and it would be much easy for you to make your point if we all ignore the most likely solution and instead accept your extremely unlikely solution at face value , but you cant actually expect people with any intelligence at all to do that . what ' s that ? campaigning and use of taxpayer fund facility like transportation for political purpose ? i suppose they pay the cop for go out of their jurisdiction too ?	1

just to stir the pot a little . we all have thing that we feel be just plain ' wrong ' . federal funding of social program , islam , religion in general , eat meat , etc , etc . we tolerate these thing because they be beneficial to , or the free choice of some , while not come at the expense of others ( except maybe the social program jp . tong ) . what make gay marriage different that we would deny it ? waxy becasue tehre be no merit to the behavior that would need special recognition . should people with attachment disorder be allow to be polygamist ? what be so special about homosexuality that it deserve to be treat different than other behavior ? remember there be no definitve evidence that it be genetic .	0

sound contradictory to me ! so what be your point ? be you claim that the tenet of christianity be in doubt because the several thousand denomination hold contradictory view ? science proceeds by challenge and contradiction . contradiction in science be not evidence of doubt but evidence of a field of advance . in religion , it be without question , a matter of the veracity of the ultimate truth . which of the thousand of christian faith hold the truth ?	0

load question if i ever saw one . gay dream be pretty common among men , but it do not make them gay . as for a straight guy in gay porn , while he should probably invest in a good career , i do not think that alone qualifies him to be gay . he could even be bi for all we know . gay dream be pretty common among men , but it do not make them gay erm . you have have dream about have sex with men ? i think you be kid yourself if you think that ' s normal for a straight guy .	0
atheist answer : its relgious people that expect us to believe in god . god himself do not have any kind of expectation . theist answer : the bible say that without faith its impossible to please god , and since the bible also say that the bible be god ' s true word , then we only need faith to believe the bible and by extension to believe in god . actually , everything the bible say ' s belies your `` atheist answer `` . the reality be that the world itself and all of god creation speak to his existence as be self evident . it take a degree of faith to accept jesus as our personal savior , but as far as accept the reality of god himself , all one need do be look observe the world we live in to see that only an incredible and loving god could create such a beautiful and marvelous world with so many amazing symbiotic and perfectly interdependent form of life .	0
i do not think the lightning strike will be prove it be merely plausibe . i think it go something like that . scientist have try to repeat what they believe happen , but to no success . anyway , atheistic evolution say that there be no intelligence , the scientist who be try to repeat what may have happen have intelligence and they make many such measurement to try and create life from lifeless chemical - in other word , the experiment be already logically flaw !	0

great , if artificial womb become avaliable then woman can get zygote transplant rather then abortion , but the question for me be ' do zygote have a right to life ? ' why do mere biology automatically = right to life ? if this be the case than non - human that be biological alive should also have the right to life . no your question be not about ' right to life ' , but more appropriate your question should be ' do they have a right to continue life ' ? and my answer be absolutely yes ! at the living single cell , when the unique property of a complete human be be create , it be live , not dead . who have a right to kill another human be ' s live existance ? no one have that right in a civil society , but we have not reach that society yet , but one day maybe .	0
no , the church be not evolve . neither be society , language , ethic , morality , or our ability to shop . only biological population evolve . nonsense , society change over time , therefore they evolve . only biological population evolve through natural selection and the theory of evolution only apply to biological population , but the term `` evolution `` applies to other thing too .	0
no , what the black do be dress in african clothes and let their afro grow out . they stop try to follow the image that be be impose on them , and instead embrace what they be . that ' s all that ' s happen here . they be not hide their sexuality in the closet any long , despite , or even because of , the fact that people like you would like them to . somehow i think most people be go to be a lot more comfortable with their kid see people in african atire with long hair than with scantily - dress ( or topless ) people simulate sex act . emoticonxrolleyes	1
' and why should you , anyway ? ' - reproduction - if the person be religious ( i do not believe god will send gay believer to hell , not sure about atheist ) - if he want to . reproduction oh yeah , because our 7 billion high population , with estimate for 10 billion by the end of the century , really need to force gay people to do it . if the person be religious in the christian religion , it only damn those who sleep with another man as he do a woman . your sexual orientation itself be not bad . and anyway , it ' s their own problem , love the sinner , hate the sin , as jesus say . i be not sure about other religion specific text against gay . if he want to . i talk about how people should not be force to , i say that some people could .	1
do you expect a creationist to understand the definition of honesty ? he ' s a creationist for cry out loud . their manta be `` to lie , steal , cheat , and defraud anyone `` to get their message across . just make sure that everybody be aware of his evasion , misrepresentation , and dishonesty . i figure a good time to do that would be while he be accuse scientist of these thing . ( i figure it ' s a damn good illustration when a paper ' s author tell him to stop misrepresent the paper , and he keep do it anyway . ) in fairness , be a creationist be not necessarily an indicator of dishonesty ; there be plenty of creationists who be creationists simply because they be uneducated about the subject . unfortunately , supersport be not part of this group ; he have see the evidence and be willfully ignorant of it .	0

belief that memory and free will exist but do not take up space do not require belief in a personal god . well memory be not something that be immaterial be it . its always implement in the form of material process well know to biochemistry . metabolism , ion flow , neuron activity and interconnection , along with potentiation of those connection into network . free - will of course be what we call the experience of our choice be not wholly determine by external state alone . by no mean do that exclude the fact that our internal state ( of which we be largely ignorant ) also play a role . the autonomy arise from the operation of the brain and those internal state . again a purely materialist explanation . and there be no evidence of anything other than material process in the experience of free - will . in other word neither memory nor free - will require a non - materialist viewpoint .	0

the difference , and i think it be a significant difference , be that omegamon spoke of feel the threat of potential harm . i believe that understand the risk that be face every day do not require be fearful of those risk . nor do it require be stupidly fearless . we all take reasonable step to reduce our risk of danger every day . to me , the use of a firearm to reduce risk do not seem all that reasonable . the intent of my open post be to find out why omegamon and others feel differently . because we have different experience than you and be more educated on the subject . the only one who tend to ask `` why do you feel you need a firearm to protect yourself `` be the one who have never face such a situation and do not know what it ' s like to be in such a position .	1

emoticonxdonno how be that fair ? basically your reasoning be `` let just give the christian the whole marriage thing , and let the gay get marry at city hall by a 67 year old judge who probably doesnt agree with them anyways . `` i mean , what happen to the separtion of church and state ? do we , somewhere along the line forget , that little document we call the constitution . it dosnt simply say `` see bible `` everybody should have equal right . no matter your race , creed , or religion . if joe and bob want to get marry , how the heck be it our place to stop them ? and im sorry if it make you uncomfortable to think of that , but unless joe come to your house to shoot your dog , its not really your concern . and come on , im tire of all these ppl use the bible to cover up simple ignorance and prejudice . so why dont we all take a hop - skip - and - jump into 2007 , re evaluate our moral , and get a clue . emoticonxgood you have to remember that those christian believe that the law of god superceed those of man . that thier allegiance be to god and his law above those of the constitution . they also believe that all should be subject to god by force if nesesary .	0

a very good argument for get the government out of ' marriage ' . let the various religion deal with / define ' marriage ' as the wish to believe . the government should only deal with ' civil union ' , regardless of the gender of the individual involve . shall we regress to babble ? the government be already heavily into the term ' marriage ' . not only the us government , but government all over the world refer to ' marriage ' as the legal union of a man and a woman . change the definition in one country would likely create confusion everywhere . what if some country require you to clarify whether you be marry to a man or a woman in order to get a visa ? do we need to define several type or class of ' married couple ' . what if some country object to the concealment of the gender of one ' s spouse institute a death penalty for it ? i would argue that legally join same - sex couple should have all the benefit and right afford married couple , but not for redefine ' marriage ' solely for the purpose of call them such .	1
people have raise scientist to undeserved height . it be clear that scientist can affect their experiment and observation , even in spite of their best effort . right . and that be the reason for peer review . creationists do not subject their ramblings to peer review . that be why so much care be devote to the proper construction of experiment to test the hypothesis by real scientist . creationists just invent ad hoc story without any experimentation .	0

wait until they be bear likely give them no more chance of survive than kill them in the womb . what chance do an unexpecting child have against a grown person intent on kill him ? i think they have more of a chance becasue , while many manage to delude themselves into believe that an unborn child be not a baby , it would be much more difficult to convince yourself that a cry baby be not a baby . even in the animal kingdom ( which we be all part of ) you see some animal hesitate to kill the young of their own specie . evne coyote will not generally kill a pup ( i have even see a pack of coyoptes pass a domestic pup without kill it , though they could have . i be tell this be because of the stubby nose , which show the coyote that it be , indeed , a puppy , even though it look unfamiliar to them ) .	0

all the law in the world will not work , criminal will always be able to get gun . if they can not buy them , smuggle them in or steal them , they will make them . criminal have even make gun inside maximum security prison . follow the link . gun - making as a cottage industry you must be joke . i be sure that make a gun be quite a bit more complicated than make a paper airplane . then why do nation which ban gun have a much low gun crime rate than the us ? if what you say be true then we would expect to see the same amount of gun crime in nation which ban gun as in the us , but we do not .	0
atheism be not a belief in the typical sense . it be a non - belief . it be the abscence of belief . a theist be one who beleives in one form of a diety or another . the prefix ' a ' mean without . thus an atheist be one without a beleif in one form of a diety or another . as to the idea of your question my non beleif come from the lack of evidence and logic in support of god as well as a lack of understanding of what be mean by ' god ' . i ask on another thread , but it fit here as well . be there a distinction between the absence of belief in x and the belief in the absence of x ? before , i suggest that i could not see a distinction , but after ponder it for awhile , i believe there be a distinction between the two : if one assert that there be no god ( or god ) , this be a belief in the absence of god . if one make no assertion one way or another ( even internally ) , then this would be an absence of belief . i be not certain into which ' side ' atheism would fall , though i believe it would have to be the former , and therefore , a belief . the latter sound more like agnosticism to me . but perhaps someone else can better clarify this topic .	0
you tell me that job and jonah be fiction . i tell you that evolution be fiction . maybe we be both right . no . not only be you wrong , you seem to lack the integrity to learn the basic of what you claim to oppose . you oppose evolution you say , but you have no idea of what it be . most educated creationists not only admit evolution , they propose evolution at rate that make real biologist laugh .	1

i do not say man do anything to make the glacier retreat . again with your strawman argument ? glacier have be advance and retreat for far long than man or any early prototype of man have be around . so i will ask yet again . do you have a point ? i have several that i want everyone who engage in the ' man cause global warming ' debate to consider . and i thank you for help to illustrate some of those point for me ( bold text above ) . asside from the point we have already discuss , . i be a bit intrigue by the fact that many of your ilk ( concern about save the life of million by reverse or slow the warm trend of the planet ) be seemingly oblivious and uncaring about the million who be deliberately kill in the name of ' choice .

the christian theistic worldview can account for the law of logic by state that they come from god . god be transcendent ; that be , he be beyond the material universe be its creator . god have originate the law of logic because they be a reflection of his nature . therefore , the law of logic be absolute . the be absolute because there be an absolute god . the atheistic worldview can not account for the law of logic / absolute , and must borrow from the christian worldview in order to rationally argue . this be totally false . the law of logic be absolute do nothing to support a case for god . in fact , everything the bible tell us about god ' s nature indicate that god be illogical , unpredictable , unreliable and irreplicable . this be totally the opposite of logic	0
maybe you can postpone it one more week and think about it for one more week , and talk to others that love you ( your boyfriend do not count ) . in the event you keep your appointment on saturday , all i can say be i be sorry , that you have to go through this event . i hope you will be okay . this be exactly what i say in a pm to her . i also suggest that she talk to woman who have have abortion , who have not , who have have adoption , and who have be adopt . i wish there be some kind of `` place `` you could go to automatically get this kind of dialogue . not internet site , but face to face stuff . want to start a counseling center ? happy 	0
because they know full well that the bulk of the confiscate weapon never come from the united state ! and we know this how ? you complain about the 90 % figure be erroneous and then make an unsupported statement like this ? furthermore , if mexico be make an earnest attempt to smash the cartel and we be finance it in part , would not we want to help reduce the weapon traffic flow south into the cartel ' s arsenal ?	0
the death penalty assure that an incorragable criminal never have the opportunity to kill anybody else . in prison , the criminal could a ) kill another inmate , 2 ) kill a guard , 3 ) escape and kill a civilian , 4 ) have their sentence commute and get out to commit another crime . quote : would you agree if the death penalty be ban ? no , for the reason state above and one more . some people do not deserve to live . like sh , for example . __________________true , gang member put in prison often kill other oppose gang member in prison so that be true . they also get put in prison and be proud some of them , gang leader consider it a mark of honor something some of them get catch by the ' fuzz ' and put in jail . who be we to decide who be to live ? what make us so much good ? hitler didnt deserve to live but that do not give us the right to kill him . i agree with shooter and proud but hey heres a situation , why do not we give murderer fate to the one most hurt by their crime , and rapist fate be decide by the one t hey rape . they would know the best . if the one rap be too young such as under maybe 10 or be like seven or its a loved one and they can not seperate justice from love , then the case be decide by law . give them the chance to live in solitary confinement , give them the chance , we can always take it away . but those kill do not get no more chance . in prison if they do kill put them in confinement . same with the others , if they be in solitary and they succeed in kill someone else , death penalty then fine . but gang murder should be different , if someone be in jail for kill a gang member in a fight or something like that , it be murder but it isnt as open and as clear justice as it be if they shoot a four year old in the head for be relate to someone in an opposing gang . then its wrong flat out , solitary or death penalty . personally id be for give them death penalty for anyone who would do that . but i have two three year old cousin who i love to death and would kill anyone who harm them so i do not want anyone to get away with kill kid . child killer be some of the bad criminal there be . so , in summary , you be not against the death penalty on principle . you just want it use judiciously ? same here . where we will differ be in the detail of what ' s judiciously .	0
and he accomplish all this human carnage without a gun . this just prove that if it be possible to eliminate all projectile fire weapon from exist on earth , men would find a way to commit atrocity against his own kind just as he do before such weapon exist if murder be in his heart . gun be not the issue , the corrupted heart / nature of humanity be . no , archangel , if it wasn ' t do with a gun present any murder commit do not count . in this case , one arm person could have end the slaughter so quickly it would be incredible but the blood dancer still could have have their day by celebrate that the gun put the child at risk more than the knife murderer and no tell what else they could say to dramatize the situation by claim that gun be ban there and that person break the law so off with his head . after they harvest his body for useful organ that be .	1

 3 - can anyone explain to me why no other ape , monkey or chimp have evolve into a new ( i . e . human ) specie ? because ape , monkey and chimp be on different path . you would not expect a shark to evolve into a barracuda - like animal . thing evolve to fill niche , we currently fill a niche , there be nothing push ape , chimp or other primate to fill a niche that be occupy .	0
no , you be spread false information . people interested in the truth try to avoid this . those give to emotional rhetoric do not mind one bit if it suit their agenda . just like the brady campaign . often when try to paint concealed carry holder as dangerous individual , most instance they cite either never have a conceal carry permit to begin with , or the matter of the case be instance that lack men - rea and be not crime to begin with .	0
nope , your argument fail again . nothing in the heller ruling suggest that gun ration law be constitutional in nature . at best heller be simply say that the individual right nature of the second amendment do not automatically rule all gun control null and void . but then again nobody be really expect it to . the detail of what be allowable and what be not have not be hammer out yet . but i would love to see you try and explain how 30 month in prison , a felony conviction record , and $ 5,000 in fine for buy two gun in one month be fair , reasonable , tough on crime , and constitutional in nature . go ahead and try . we will wait . what be conveniently miss from your response ? an explanation of why a limit on the number of gun that can be purchase during a certain time period be not a law which impose `` condition and qualification on the commercial sale of arm `` per heller . if the punishment do not fit the crime it do not necessarily follow that the crime be constitutionally protect . execute someone for shoplift would be unjustifiable . however , that do not mean that there be a constitutional right to shoplift .	0
 i can empirically prove the existence of the god of the bible via its central claim oh dear , delude philisopher nutter alert . no one can empirically prove anything . fact . end of discussion .	1
you talk about the fourteenth amendment and again claim that gun control be racist . if gun control be truly racist then it ' s a wonder that the court in area with strict gun control law have not be flood with claim of violation of the fourteenth amendment ' s equal protection clause . funny how only a few people on an online message board have manage to figure this out . because the modern application of gun control be to target everyone . but that do not change the fact that gun control begin as a purely racist concept .	0
do not you dare try and give me a lecture about cherry picking ! all you ever do be cherry pick ! you come around about once a month , scour the news to find a crime commit with a gun , and you use that single incident as if it ' s evidence that there ' s a serious problem that threaten the entire nation . if that ' s not cherry pick then i do not know what be . as a gun owner i be also a property owner . or be you deny that gun be property ? i have be post at least a few time a week . that ' s a lot more than once a month . i point out that the us have high level of gun crime than most developed nation while you try to focus on a few tragedy in response to someone question the claim that criminal will always get gun . i think it ' s obvious whose argument be more cherry pick .	0

i be kinda sorry i challenge smallax on this issue , but i be pretty sure that gore know there be not icecap at the north pole . there be arctic ice cap , such as the big one in greenland , just not at the pole . as steve martin once say , ' well , ecuuse me ' . no polar icecap today ? ok what be the proper - pc terminology - that refer to the big chunk of ice , what sit over the top of the north and south region of the planet ? as long as it be not too long of a description or too lame - i can evolve to the next phase and say .

a few block from my house there be a group of store with some office on the second floor . apparently there be a planned parenthood office in the complex because a group of anti - abortion protestors be there the other day . i do not know that before then . i wonder what they hop to accomplish by their protest so i ask them . one woman say she hop to discourage woman from consider abortion . i do not think of it at the time , but plan parenthood do a lot more than abortion service . i wonder if the protest might also dissuade a young woman who be seek contraceptive service from go into that office as well . if this be the case , the abortion protest would accomplish the opposite of their goal . they potentially could have increase the chance of an unwanted pregnancy by discourage contraceptive use . in turn , this might increase the chance of an abortion . i wonder if anti - abortion folk ever consider that ? the goal of anti - abortionist be clear . the job of self restraint be that of each participant in their close encounter .	0

its difficult to merge life in its pure form with science , even though science ' s purpose be to study life . that ' s not true - - actually , it do not make sense . science be just a bunch of rule ( by definition ) . `` biology use science to study life `` be true . `` physics use science to study the physical world `` be true , but `` science ' s purpose be to study life `` be not true .	0
 snip of silly , irrelevant religious claptrap creation be not a necessity , but i have yet to see substantial evidence to disprove it . but you have not look . you may claim that your god do it , and no evidence to support or deny that can be offer . the assertion relies on miracle and have no suporting evidence . but when you start talk about how your god do it , your claim can be debunk by fact . certainly the mythology of ancient nomadic herdsman be not accurate . if you look at the world and the history of the world the be evident in the geologic stratum , then you can see that the earth be very old , and you can see a succession of organism through time . when consider with other field of science from genetics to biogeography to physiology and anatomy , evolution becomes apparent .	0
i know what i be talk about , and you know , but only you want to wrangle . and why do you want to contradict that ? contradict what ? thank you for acknowledge that i know what i be talk about . i call it question . you call it wrangle because you have no coherent thought of your own .	1
maybe , but he ' s no centrist and with the way the congress look he will most likely put very anti - gun judge in the supreme court , which mean the 2 nd amendment would be pretty much dead . do not believe me ? look at california . stupid law we have and they do not even work ! criminal still steal and buy illegal weaponry . the judge here be so far leave , they themselves admit it ! ( look up judge reinhardt . ) i be not say be a lefty be bad , it ' s just that it seem some would throw away a right just to `` feel `` safe . that ' s the bad thing you can do . that just sound alarmist to me . do you realize the actual implication of take away second amendment right ? it be just not go to happen .	0
i hope you dont believe everything that be write in a textbook that have be change over and over . the bible never have . and that ' s the rub : it never have ( apart from when it have of course , with the various version that exist ) . you choose to put faith in the writing of a primitive bronze age society . i prefer to trust a textbook that be regularly update to reflect our late finding ; our most up to date and accurate knowledge of the world .	0
but i do take offence at you characterize my ability to reason logically and to think with some originality as be nothing more than ' manipulation ' and sophistry . the value of logical reasoning be dependent upon your axiom . highly religious people be no less capable of reason logically than anyone else - but the unshakeable axiom that their personal version of god really exist enters into every equation . for you , one axiom be the existence of vitality ; volition make quantifiable , and the other be that darwinian evolution must be wrong and worthless in every respect . there be no logical reason for you to deride ns the way you do ; it ' s an integral part of any evolutionary theory that seek to explain the big picture of how the organism we see around us come to be ; the occurrence of mutation , volitional or otherwise be not enough on its own . but your axiom prevent you from incorporate it into eam and get on with your life .	0

evolution implies specie go through a process of advantagous and purposful change no it do not . first , the change may not be neutral . i will presume that you be intelligent enough to grasp that idea the mutation in and of themselves be neither advantagous nor disadvantageous , and the they have no purpose . evolution happen when the mutation ( and other mechanism that increase genetic diversity ) be act upon by other mechanism of evolution . even in natural selection there be no purpose . natural selection be differential reproductive success . some organisms tend to produce more offspring because they have characteristic that give them an advantage in a particular environment .	0
no , it ' s because there be no evidence of their existence . for instance , we can not see air , but we have evidence of its existence . the most valid argument be that there be planet that can support life . i say it ' s valid because this be true ( unlike other alien argument ) . but this be not a good argument for alien existence because the condition themselves do not prove life . they just prove condition . my goodness . i speak to fast . happy i will give you that one . i be shock you even take the time to reply to my petty argument .	0
so if a drug addict , or an alcoholic stand up and say , `` god make me this way `` , should we accept that fact , and give them drug or alcohol . however , we do give people alcohol , there be many people who drink it on a regular basis who be not addict . what do these substance you mention have to do with be gay ? would it perhaps be okay for me to have homosexuality on the weekend or after work during happy hour ?	1
that just show how nutty it be . use your argument , someone could reject all scientific theory because most of them be wrong : apparently even yec be in this sense more rational than dawkins . the claim that faith be accept mainly because people be tell to be very dodgy . religion seem to naturally arise , although there be many theory as to how and why , religious and otherwise . think of religion like morality : the idea varies , but seem to exist everywhere and often seem to appeal to the same thing . it be often ' taught ' but this do not mean it do not occur naturally : indeed , a system of explain away what would otherwise be ethical / religious be need , and this require a more direct and deliberate move : thus the cack - hand attempt at replace religion with deliberate human construct . daniel dennett asks , how do just one specie , homo sapiens , acquire the numinous perspective that can have such a profound influence on people ' s life ? he seem to think that religion evolve and originally serve a ' primitive ' philosophical intention - such as explain the hidden ' cause ' of natural event in pre - scientific society . to give just one example : the rise and fall of the tide be observe , but not understood . so the phenomenon be attribute to the power of a god ( or god ) etc . i think this be a pretty commonplace answer , but not necessarily wrong . why have religion survive the scepticism of the intellectual enlightenment and the rational attack of science ? the idea that some fundamental ' psychic need ' in humanity be satisfy by have religious belief seem ( to me ) the most promising speculation .	0
so three people get filthy rich while everyone else starve be a good thing ? cultural degradation do not lead to stability , sorry . and again , how be this good ? not at all , as it make people want to revolt . i never say all dictatorship be cause by the us . . that you know of . i ' d say out of the 6 billion people on earth at least 4 billion of them be richer right now than they would be have the economic system never change since the era of globalization begin . i do not think the number be as small as 3 people . how do not it lead to stability . think china and their reform to capitalism and westernization . be them more of a threat to the world as a communist nation or as a globalized nation ? it will be stabilize to have them westernize . however , it be not necessarily good . yeah i can see what you mean . the people be just about ready to burst because the us and canada depend so much on each other . nor do i . whew , we agree on something happy be not that the truth .	0

i think it might show the true character of some people . i may disagree with you and others but i will not go spray paint your house or tear down any ad you put up . whatever happen to respect for others ? this apply to pro - life and pro - choice by the way . and if someone have write an ad proclaiming that black american be inferior the same thing would have happen as well . i can not justify what they do but when you put such a hot - button issue out like that into the open . it have to be expect . people have strong feeling about abortion right ( just like racism ) and it be naive to think something like this wasn ' t go to happen .	0

i think your question should be ' why do god make commandment ? ' because that ' s what ' thou shalt not kill , thou shalt not covet ' be ? and no , commandment be not design to help you live happily and without fear . its actually the exact opposite : commandment serve the purpose of keep people under control through the use of fear . sin mean diobeying the commandment . as for homosexuality and witchcraft , they be sin because there be commandment against them . i think you be miss the point . why would you want to keep people under control ? to prevent them from harm other people . the men who create the commandment and the bible i believe have good intention . they want to give people a reason to live their life well , and the bible be the best and most intelligent thinking of the time ( not modern , ancient ) . it be a good idea , however people start look past the ' love thy neighbor ' stuff and start focus on unimportant thing like homosexuality and abortion . so , my question be why be homosexuality a sin ?	0
i guess you be read it wrong , then . back then , marriage be a commitment to one another and do not have legal meaning . that ' s just it . if you want to go by the original definition of marriage , like so many anti - gay people talk about , no one who get a marriage should get legal benefit . however , they would never be willing to give this up , so by deny gay the right of those same benefit for the same commitment , it be just pure and unadulterated bigotry . by the way , look at post 9 to see what i think of the whole civil union movement . so be dominate and enslave of woman . do not mean we should do it just because it have historicity . actually i have hear this idea by numerous people , on both side of the issue . i can see the merit myself - - give couple ' benefit in a way that do not utilize a cultural and religious institution that have nothing to do with legality to begin with . that way at least cultural marriage do not have to be redefine to any extent and legal benefit would no longer be any sort of reflection of any one group ' s cultural and ideological view . by the way , what do you mean by ' anti - gay ' in your phrase ' anti - gay people ' ? that ' s always important to nail down .	1

peter be obviously there be more writing of peter apart from the gospel of mark and 1 & 2 peter you find in the bible . you will discover it be not only the bible that the church use for their deposit of faith but a number of other writing regard as sacred tradition . it be peter and the apostle who have influence over paul not vice versa . if peter and the apostle influence paul and peter have primacy among the apostle obviously it be peter who influence the church not paul , since paul be influence by peter ! if a frog have wing he would not bump his butt when he jump . base on result paul have more influence . how can you simply ignore the obvious ? christianity have hurt itself over and over again because of it ' s unwillingness to concede that sometimes it ' s wrong . how long do it take the church to acknowledge the earth move around the sun or that the earth wasn ' t flat . instead they either ignore the issue , bury it through violence or intimidation , or come up with some ridiculous idea that be base on nothing to justify why they be right .	0

' white guilt be the big flaw in the american psyche ' , say dr . david yeagley , comanche indian source : comanche_patriot — — — — — — — — — — white pride and white guilt today in the united state and most of the white world , as soon as a white child begin his formal education , he be implicitly tell that he should feel guilt for the crime of his ancestor . guilt for find , conquer , enslave , and kill off non - white around the globe . and litter in the process . this guilt stem not from his own crime , but from the suppose crime of other ( dead ) people of the same race . but the child be never encourage to take pride in the amazing achievement of his race . more : white pride and white guilt — — — — — — — — — — white guilt , obamamania , and the reality of race support obama for president , like support colin powell a decade ago , be see by many white as the ultimate in white guilt repellent . i do not recall ever meet any white person who personally felt guilty for the trouble of african - american . but i have know many white who want to loudly blame other white for black difficulty . more : vdare . com : 01/02/07 - white guilt , obamania , and the reality of race — — — — — — — — — — white guilt = black power white guilt be best understood as a vacuum of moral authority . white live with this vacuum despite the fact that they may not feel a trace of personal guilt over past oppression of black . white simply come to a place with black where they feel no authority to speak or judge and where they sense a great risk of be see as racist . one terrible feature be that it mean white lack the authority to say what they see when look at black and black problem . political correctness be what white have the authority to say about black , no matter what they see . it be a language of severely limited authority , of euphemism that steer white around association with racism . the muteness that white guilt imposes on white undergirds black power . it let black live inside the silence of white , and have our weakness be unutterable by white even as they be plainly visible . messrs . jackson and sharpton be enforcer of white silence . and when white be silent , black mediocrity be no deterrent to black advancement . everywhere that minority press institution today as group , there be an erosion of excellence . the reason for this be that white guilt allows institution to respond only with deference – defer to the great moral authority of minority by lower standard , and remain mute to minority mediocrity , to save the institution from the racist label . so white have make it socially virtuous to defer and stand aside as institution erode . the public school be all but devastate , university be stunt by ideology , corporation be more unctuous than church , the medium be more unctuous yet , and american politician – of left and right – speak in barren clichés about all of this when they speak at all . more : white guilt = black power — — — — — — — — — — white guilt . myth or reality ? shana attend a big 12 school and be always see white girl her age or young proposition by black men who get offend if rebuff . she personally know of one girl who have her entire social life ruin by a black man who call her a racist at a party because she would not be alone with him .

' a hush settle over the crowd and a bunch of people look at her like she be a pariah . the girl end up go back home when all of her dormmates start harass her for be a ' bigot ' . white guilt be when a white person feel sorry for a person of color to such a point that they sacrifice their own right , and often their own self - respect in a futile hope that somehow their action will atone for the real or imagined sin of their ancestor . arab have slave . as long as the slave be not muslim it be legal . arab be even the organizer of the african slave trade to the west . yet there be no arab guilt over slavery . the roman have their entire economy power by slave . and often their own people be slave . yet there be no italian or roman guilt . and the ultimate irony about the american slave trade be that many african tribe make raid on other tribe and then sell their human booty to western or arabic slaver , yet there be no african guilt . why white guilt then ? one of the reason be the medium . more : queen of succubi present white guilt fact or myth ? — — — — — — — — — — white guilt : today , tomorrow , and forever just recently , after decline a funding request from one of chicago ’ s numerous beggar , i hear a most peculiar thing . the man yell at me as i walk away : “ i ’ m sorry i ’ m not white . ” at first i assume he be talk to someone else ; then i saw that he wasn ’ t . his tactic must have be an attempt to shame pedestrian into give him more change . presumably , as the man do not look like a novice to this ancient profession , it must be a strategy that , with the exception of this occasion , work , which tell us quite a bit about the psyche of caucasian american . more : american renaissance news : white guilt : today , tomorrow , and forever — — — — — — — — — — the myth behind white guilt - part 1 . the slave trade one of the many weapon which our opponent use against us , and also against others of european ancestry , be often termed historical white guilt . those who hate us point accusingly to our empire , and to our involvement in the transatlantic slave trade with the implication that we , particularly the british and european american , be uniquely guilty of crime against other race . they believe that , by make us feel guilty about our past , we will be less inclined to object to what be do to us on behalf of our alleged ' victim ' . more : the myth behind white guilt - part 1 . the slave trade | national policy institute here be an accurate depiction of white guilt at work every day in north america and europe . . oh blah ! blah ! blah ! what the devil do comanche know ? the sisterhood and brotherhood of sioux , navajo , iroquois and other sundry tribe .	1

yeah it be too , trebor . you be totally confused , as usual . nor do you have the courage to post the tenet of your religious belief and defend them . because you can not , and because you be clueless . ' we the people of the united state , in order to form a more perfect union , establish justice , insure domestic tranquility , provide for the common defence , [ 1 ] promote the general welfare , and secure the blessing of liberty to ourselves and our posterity , do ordain and establish this constitution for the united state of america . ' there you go , easy and archy . that ' s the only part that matter when it come to the purpose for the founding of this country . notice that it it base on the authority of ' we the people ' . it do not say , ' in the name of jesus .

e ' past ( from many year ago in fact ) in their face when they mess up . the same could be say of clinton . tell me . how do people learn if you insist on cover up these situation ? if a person like sanford be not expose to his own medicine , how will he ( or others ) not recognize how it taste ? furthermore , i find your perspective a little baffling . what he say `` many year ago `` ? be that something he should be embarrass of , because he be wrong ? or should he be embarrass cause he get catch ? cause the standard of not cheat on your wife be not a bad standard . it ' s a good standard . we have too many politician who look out for their own interest , and say thing just for political gain not to take it seriously .	0
i have never understand this need to call baby he or she , rather than `` it `` . i refer to my own daughter use `` it `` for the first month after she be bear . it be only because my own mother object to me do so that i stop . baby look like baby , not like boy or girl . it make sense to refer to them as `` it `` . it also save stranger get embarrased when they guess the gender wrongly . refer to baby as `` it `` : it be not disrespectful and it ' s sensible . well i know it would not be sensible for anyone to call my child an it that be just disrespectfull to both your partener and child .	0
what poland ' s leader be think . be an couple billion dollar worth be target by several hundred russian warhead ? the us be try to convince poland to let them place part of the us missile shield in poland . they be do this in their normal bribing way . however , since the shield can obviously in the future be use against china and russia , be it worth it to poland to go from be not an target to be the coordinate for many multimegaton warhead ? and you have to account for the likelihood of any actual exchange . so it be worth it to the pole ? do someone hack your account , oblivious ? you sound like a fsb bot in this post . 	1

i have post this before , but i will post it again to filter out the digressive post of the anti - gun people . i guess they be hop to change the subject to something they could debate , but it do not seem to work , now do it ? statistically , tobacco kill nine time as many people as all homicide and gun accident combine , and alcohol kill almost twice as many as die in gun - related death . ( src ) even if you count suicide ( assume every single one of them be with a gun , which they be not ) , alcohol still kill more people . so , if your intention be to save life , then why do not you ban this stuff ? could it have something to do with the fact that you enjoy alcohol and tobacco ? it ' s a lot easy to kill someone with a gun than a cigarette or a beer .	1
i do not know if you read the last part of my post , but i will repeat it more clearly . a baby be always reliant and demanding of another person ' s care . a baby outside of the womb still depend on its mother ( or somebody at least ) to consistently keep him fed , to help him sleep and to change his diaper . a baby can stay alive for a bare minimum of time outside the womb , but it still need care . viable may not be the right word for you . maybe i should say as ' genuine ' a baby as the newborn . and you be correct when you say : ' ' the probability be progressively less with each few number of week . ' but that only make sense when the womb be empty . when the womb be occupy , it be occupy with a living function baby . function ? the fetus breathe freely ? it cry when it be hungry or uncomfortable ? it demand attention ? it smile and coo and be cute to those who behold it ? wow ! do not know that fetus be that active and functional .	1

be that worth it ? i do not think so . i have my own idea for a healthcare plan . it ' s not at all universal , but it help the people who need help without subject people to substandard care . i have hear that the usa spend around 40 % ( total ) more on health care than canada do . that would be impressive if it be not for one fact . the usa have 900 % of our population . it be your administration cost what be get you the most . we only spend around 11 % on administration while the usa spend around 25 % of their health care dollar . we have a cap on how much a doctor can be sue for as well . yes , our system be not perfect , but it still work . nearly 50 million american do not have health care at all , that be around 18 % of your total population . this be quite shameful . as i have state , the usa be the only nation in the industrialize world to not have universal health care .	0
interesting and so revealing , you be so twisted in your thinking that you equate amoral liberal / socialist as real american while consider traditionalist like me as less than ' real american ' ? your side anti american sentiment be why this country be spiral into a moral and fiscal decline that we may be too late to salvage for the next generation . as for make call and drive your 5 liberal to vote early , if this be even true , sorry , but it ' s too little to late . the ' real american ' have reject your messiah ' s gospel of marxism and will vote out all of the liar who support his marxist agenda . now bend over and take it like a man because we be on the eve of your reality check . emoticonxbouncer emoticonxagree i love how you claim that the teabag party be not affiliate with the republican , who be they go to vote with ? . the democrat ? . they may not claim to be republican but last i check we only have two major party represent us in the house and senate , with maybe one or two independent . the tea bag party be not big enough to control anything without republican so enlighten me , who be they go to vote with to destroy what obama have accomplish so far ? . 	1

these last two case be of course not the norm , but they indicate the wide - range of idea that can be routinized by the judicious quoting of scientific authority . and you have just describe `` creation science . `` no application of the scientific method . no testing . the conclusion be know before the judicious quoting of scientific authority have even begin . i notice that you use one of those quote of a scientific authority below . you show that you be what you decry .	1

kronus , if you have the spirit of christ live inside you like the bible say his follower have , you would be preach / defend jesus instead of warm up to a pagan infidel like orion , who have now spend some 8 year slander and attack the biblical jesus ( chant `` gay jesus `` ) and most anyone who believe in him . ez , if the concept of gay jesus offend you , why do you bring up the subject incessantly ? you be the only one who do this around here . truly bizarre . for example . 	0

some argue that the mountain be not that tall yet . that make no sense whatsoever give the rate of tectonic plate drift . plate move at 1 inch a year . that ' s 500 foot over 6,000 year . everest be by far taller then that . some argue that plat move faster . to create everest in 6,000 year would mean plate would have to move almost five foot every year in the same direction . while plate movement be relate to the earth ' s core heat , the necessary heat to have that much movement would mean the earth ' s core would have to be hundred of time hotter . that ' s way more then the surface of the sun . but even bad , even if there be some unknown mechanism to cause such movement , it would generate heat . the heat generate by the creation of the mountain of the world would be more than enough to reduce the entire surface to melt lava . add to that the fact that the condensation of the `` vapor canopy `` would release enough heat to boil all of the water on earth .	0

i ' personally ' feel that sex ed encourage have sex , and not abstinence . they should be teach just the basic , and child if they be interested can talk about it with their parent or old friend . abstinence be not be encourage , rather shun . maybe i be just old fashion , and 16 at the same time i love how what you ' personally ' feel be in direct conflict with acedemic study . science say force = mass time acceleration , but i personally feel that force = velocity time volume , so that must be the right answer .	1
many of the gun hat crowd also own gun . it ' s the elitism belief , that they be superior to all human and thus deserve to be arm , while everyone else in the world should be unarmed and bow before them as if they be god . make about as much sense as say many of the car hating crowd ( people who support such law as car registration ) also own car . more evidence that your handler have train you to see the world in black and white .	1
science tell us that there be no global flood a la noah , not that there be no god . now , if you choose to interpret that as a reasonable person and realize that science show that `` a noah ' s flood - causing god `` do not exist , then kudos . this do not mean that there be no god whatsoever . the error you be make be that you be equate creationism with god . we have disprove special creation . handily . so one might say that there ' s good evidence that a god represent by a literal interpretation of the bible do not exist . but that do not mean that no god exist , or that a christian god do not exist . that ' s the standard dance . victor stenger do not say it that way . on the back of his book , one review put it this way ;	0
similarly , if you be boyfriend be happy to have sex with someone 2 year young than he be ( which be a pretty significant age gap at that age ) . how long have the boyfriend be 16 ? be he close to 15 or 17 ? how long have nocturnal09 be 14 ? be she close to 13 or 15 ? if nocturnal09 will be 15 in a couple of day or so and the boyfriend just turn 16 about a month ago , then the 14 v 16 thing be not really the big deal . depend on when their b - day fall , they could both be in the same graduating class . he could have be bear in may 1990 while she be bear in july 1991 . therefor , he be 16 but she will still be 14 for at least another half of a month . now , none of this information be give . all i be say be that the 2 year gap ( until more info be give there ) can not be consider the big problem .	0
religion = faith in a deity or deity ( rough definition ) atheism = lack of religion / deities therefore , atheism = lack of faith there be no `` faithful `` begin point of atheism . so atheism do not `` need `` fact ? if it claim to have complete knowledge of evolution , do not it need all the fact ? if the answer be no , then how can it argue against religion ? miller do not explain it .	0
if we be create in god ' s image , then it would make sense that equally our emotion be a reflection of god ' s emotion . that our emotion be imperfect version of his . of course i would personally say that when man invent god , they felt the need to give him human characteristic in order to make their invention more understandable . and to assist in the oppression of others by the ever - present threat of an ' angry god who will smite you ' . an ' ambivalent god who be above that sort of thing ' just be not as good at convince people that whatever you say be right . man can not invent anything that do not already exist in form . do we invent the wheel , or discover the idea ? do the wright brother invent machine power flight , or be it that they stumble upon it ? in every culture , in every society , man look to something great than himself . they simple do not leave it at themselves and be do with it .	1
abortion , voting , spousal abuse , property ownership , social status , equal pay and the list go on . in the us as recently as 50 - year ago , the list be endless if the woman be black living in certain us state . we be make some social progress , but that seem to be slow in several state as our government impose siege mentality roll out the same old insecurity . as post by tastyfish in kinder term , fundamentalist consider the past century of advancement of woman right as a bad thing ; barefoot , pregnant , uneducated and chain in the hut be their ideal woman . i be sorry , but i find this completely ridiculous and unfounded . i can see ( remotely ) how abortion might be consider anti - woman ( although it be of course anti - life before be anything else ) , but how have christianity directly sanction the question of woman ' s suffrage , spousal abuse , property ownership , social status , etc ? . by the way , do you consider fundamentalist to be the best representative of a religion ? i be catholic , and i believe i understand the dogma and principle of my faith quite enougth to say that nothing of what you have mention ( except abortion , because it have nothing to do with woman ' s right ) be view positively by the catholic church , or ever have be . please explain with detail .	0

but the creationists continue to attempt to impose their religion on others as science by the late `` intelligent design `` movement . the id movement be nothing more than creationism that attempt to avoid a mention of god . once id theory ( which be not theory since it be not base on evidence and test ) be allow into the school , then the next step will be to introduce the fundamentalist christian god as the designer . oh what a shame ! especially if it ' s true ! where do you get the idea that id theory be not base on evidence and / or testing ?	1

by what standard of evidence do evolution science claim a direct evolutionary relationship with those hominid that precede us such as java , peking and neanderthal man , be it base on chromosomal , amino acid , cytochrome c , genetics , dna , lifestyle , or simply base on their hominid / primate similarity ? now if you come back with evidence that neanderthal bury their dead , and deduce from that a direct relationship with modern man , then surely some chemical relationship have also be discover since the advent of dna technology , whether it it nuclear or mitochondrial similarity / connection , or one of the other chemical relationship mention above . but rather than be honest about your mistake , you just change thing without pay any attention to the fact that we have show you have no idea what you be talk about when it come to the claim of the scientific community . at least , not until somebody tell you .

my point wasn ' t to show that the unborn be a person but to show that the real question be not `` who get to determine the future of a woman ' s pregnancy , the woman herself or some nameless faceless bureaucrat ? `` but whether or not the unborn be a person . i think there be two separate question here . ( 1 ) when do personhood begin ? ( 2 ) who get to make such arbitrary , moral decision on behalf of a pregnant woman ? both be legitimate issue of contention . you can not just dismiss the one you do not want to argue as unimportant . there be lot of excellent argument go every which way , and many of them be objectively unresolvable , such as the one pertaining to the onset of personhood . they be truly matter of opinion . so , since there be obviously little agreement between people about when an egg and sperm become a person with full human right , the practical question really be whose opinion matter most ? the woman ' s , or the faceless bureaucrat ' s ? emoticonxgood	0

this question be premise on an untenable assumption : that people should not be allow to vote on particular issue . this premise be clearly not true in any democratic society , and be especially not true in the united state . in the united state , it be a contradiction in term to say someone be not allow to vote on x . i have demonstrate this before , and yet the same silly question keep come up . that ' s not exactly true now , be it ? people get to vote for elected official , and that ' s all that ' s guarantee federally . some state have provision for allow people to vote on local law , but in some state the government be allow to prevent the vote . and of course there be no provision at all allow the people to vote on federal law . so in point of fact it be a true statement that in the united state someone be not allow to vote on x , for some value of x .	0

i suspect that a lot of people , if not most people , at least partially follow some version of `` treat others as you would have yourself be treat `` . when , as child , we be scold `` how would you like it if . `` that be a tactic of teach this rule . for those who be religious ( which i only marginally , occasionally and hesitatingly be ) , even jesus state `` do to others whatever you would like them to do to you . `` in the sermon on the mount talk ( as quote by shadowpikachu ) . many world religion and philosophy seem to incorporate that general rule , which be partly why i think it have a reasonable chance at be incorporate as a global base of morality . exactly . most people would incorporate it , from childhood most often . steve can not seem to wrap his mind around that .	0

blood relationship be never base on choice , yet they entail moral obligation , nonetheless . this be why the court prosecute negligent parent . they have consistently rule , for example , that father have an obligation to support their child even if they be unplanned and unwanted . every relationship do entail moral obligation in one way or another , but the argument be that there be no relationship that morally obligate one to share one body . they be try to generalize ' moral obligation ' as if that justify anything . there be thing that can not be morally obligate , no matter the relationship , so the argument try to prove .	0

i be just follow your logic to its ultimate logical conclusion . liberal do not give a damn about individual freedom ; they want governmental control over all aspect of your life . they want gov ' t control of healthcare because they think we be too dumb to fend for ourselves . they want to indoctrinate our kid in school because they do not trust parent to be parent . the list of liberal intrusisms into our life be endless . that be just conservative bias . conservative be just as guilty of the same thing as liberal and then each have their own ideological idiocy that be unique to each group . conservative like class and do not like change . a pure conservative society would fail just as quickly as a pure liberal one . the last 10 - 20 year as we have become more us vs . them the overall prosperity and well be of the country have decline . with both side take the country to extreme . conservative ease restriction and corporation run wild . those law be in place for a reason . liberal overreact and put a choke hold on growth . there be a reason for less restrictive law , but now they can not do anything meaningful .	0

be even ' channel ' sufficiently ateleological a verb ? yes . it describe an action without ascribe its form to its end result , outcome , whatever but strictly to a cause / s force / s in action . that be why ' selection ' be always teleological . in order to select or choose anything , an end must always be in view . there must always be a volitional discrimination of option base upon a criterion dictate by the desired end . the only time `` channel `` becomes teleological be when something live [ a human or a beaver , let us say ] intententionally do the channeling . but since it be understood that mechanical force can also ' channel ' , unintentional , out of simple mechanic , the word channel can not be call teleological . in the same way , ' sort ' can be consider non - teleological , hence mechanical , and thus suit to your glossary , because thing can be sort by mechanical force alone . but ' selection ' always require volition and awareness . so ' selection ' be always teleological .	0
disease use to be ascribe to god and it be think that those people who get sick deserve to be sick because of their lack of piety . now we know that diseases strike indiscriminately ( where piety be concern ) and affect people only base on their risk of acquire the virus and their general state of health . there be many other example . see above . nothing have be demonstrate that convinces me that god have be rule out of all these issue . he probably be not active in all situation , but there ' s nothing that say he ( or even satan ) be totally inconsequential either .	0

i do not think it ' s fair to put the blame on woman who wear explicit clothing . there be time when self control be need . if a man can not exercise that self control , to a point where he rap a woman , then he do deserve jail . this be partly right though , woman do cause a lot of mixed message when they go out wear almost nothing . however , if she say no . it mean no . and we should not go around blame the victim of a sexual assault . dear , as i have already say that rape be commit by person of imbalance mind / or intoxicated person . so , logically they can not exercise self control ( and that ' s y we call them mentally imbalanced ) . i agree , that if a woman say no , it mean no . but , in that state of mind a man can not understand that she be deny , what a rapist think be only his sexual gratification . and that ' s y its a crime . and we have punishment for it . thank you for ur time . and i appreciate ur view . 	0

so why do toe ignore horizontal gene transfer for so many decade ? can you tell me how it be that gene transfer horizontally ( without go through selection ) validate darwinism , which say all beneficial trait must pass through selection in order to be adapt ? it do not because it be not clear till the 1 9 7 0 s that horizontal gene transfer be something to be consider . nobody know the mechanism till that era . and of course hgt be just another form of variability to be take into account . gene transfer horizontally be as subject to selection as anyother form of gene . once intergrated into the recieving genome they be simply one more heritable element and if they alter the phenotype ( many be either neutral or even inactivatee ) then of course they be subject to selection . why do you think otherwise ? remember that horizontal transfer be a rare event roughly on a par with ordinary mutation .	0

so why , in this gun - hater ' s dream come true of congress , do they choose not to advance a single gun control bill and have it sign into law ? i do not find it surprising . it ' s probably a strategic sacrifice on their part rather than a change in their personal view . they do not want to lose vote and possible support from gun owner for their priority like health care reform because of a difference of opinion on gun control policy . they know that the republican be go to hit them with everything they have get during election time and exaggerated accusation about the democrat want to take away people ' s gun would hurt them . the republican learn during the clinton year that create as much as paranoia as possible about the democrat support big government be the way to regain a majority in congress . it ' s all politics .	0
ahh . there you have it . restrict ammo , not gun . would be a far more succesful way of enforce gun - control . would that work like the ban on illegal drug in american ? do that ban keep illegal drug out of american ? the ban on illegal drug do one thing , it do keep illegal drug from law - abide citizen . law - abiding citizen be the only one that respect the law when it come to ban .	0
well to get healthcare from $ 6000 per person to $ 3,400 per person you ' d have to pay them less or fire them . so do i understand you correctly that we will either cut pay or fire doctor and nurse ? you be just play dumb , right ? there will be few technician and few order for equipment per insured . their pay will not be cut . there will be few of them per insured . initially the absolute volume will increase .	1

so with that , it ' s also pretty easy to imagine that there be no need for the human genome to mutate to accommodate a fruitless / vitaminc - less diet . likewise , we also know that primate also consume a diet high in fruit , leaf and berry , thereby get plenty of vitamin c . so like human , primate would have no reason for their genome to mutate if they eat fruit and leave high in vitamin c from the beginning . well yes , but thats not what defective gulo indicate . if one have external source of vitamin c , gulo can mutate to be inactive without cause a problem , and once inactive the inactive gene can be inherit without cause problem so long as vitamin c intake be high enough . an inactive gulo indicate that the specie have external source of vitamin c which be essential to many metabolic process .	0

we think it would take roughly a million year for bacteria to evolve enzyme capable of digest nylon ( because the compound be so different than any they be able to digest ) but it take less than a century . . be they able to show a previously non - exist code that mutate on a gene somewhere and create this new enzyme activity ? it sound to me that this `` new `` enzymatic activity come from non - cod dna switch on a gene to produce it . that be what one would expect to find . . * two new enzyme activity , 6 - aminohexanoate cyclic dimer hydrolase and 6 - aminohexanoate dimer hydrolase , be detect inthe adapted strain . * . 	0

no , because 2 + 2 = 4 if you agree with it or not . it ' s a concept that be not dependent on man to agree with it . that ' s exactly the point . regardless of whether or not human mind think differently , whichever mind produce and agree that 2 + 2 = 4 be absolutely correct , the rest be wrong . we know this because we can observe and test the concept in the physical world and prove that it be true . this go for just about anything , dissention in the face of fact do not change the fact . imho , this invalidate your claim that something produce in the human mind be not absolute due to some human mind be contradictory .	0

bingo . this be spot on . why suggest a repeal of the entirety of doma if you support the policy establish by part of doma ? and i repeat my early observation : if doma be such a travesty , why not go ahead and try to repeal it as a senator . such a repeal would have to be initiate by congress anyway . it ' s highly unlikely that he could accomplish a repeal of doma as president . because there be still a lot of people in this country that support oppression and injustice toward gay people .	0

if abortion be make illegal i predict that you will see across the border abortion clinic , in canada and state that still premit abortion . be we to fill the prison with those seek abortion in place where it be legal if they live in state that do not allow abortion ? prolifers well becare for what they wish for . prolifers tend to be conservative and do not like tax . they better get ready to pay , in tax , for the extra prison and social program need for all those abandon child . your claim be not support in the least . if we look to the landmark abortion case roe v . wade , we find that it be not woman seek abortion that be punish , but the people who procure the abortion that be . it would be the same if abortion be again make illegal . to prove this , we need only to look at a recent abortion regulatory statute : the partial birth abortion ban act . needless to say , there be far less doctor who perform abortion than there be woman who seek them , and because it be not a problem execute abortion law prior to 1973 , it likewise will not be a problem execute abortion law should abortion be make illegal again .	0

a well regulated militia be intend to minimize dependence on a standing army which the founder think be a threat to liberty . i be not sure what you be claim be a contradiction . how do this address your claim that the second amendment serve as a defense against a tyrannical federal government ? be you move the goalpost now ?	1
look over the heller ruling again . all nine judge agree unanimously that the second amendment protect a right that be wholly individual in nature . the only disagreement be whether the right still apply today . stevens say that bear arm have a military meaning . so be he say that the right be individual but exist in connection with militia service ? be this some kind of hybrid model ? interestingly , scholar who make similar claim in the past got lump in with those who support a collective right by the pro gun crowd . but i suppose it sound good to say that all nine supreme court justice support an individual right interpretation .	0
no , god love me so much that he send his son to earth to pay the penalty for my sin . past , present and future . i have eternal life now , base on the promise in god ' s word . i also know that , like a loving father , god discipline me to get me back on track and in line with his will . i ' t true that god love you , but god can not accept you the way you be now . if and when you discover who god really be , then you will understand that god change people from within . god want you to come to him , but on his term , not yours . i love it when christian say this . pay who , for what , whose sin ? if he be god , no one have to die for anything . he could blink his eye and everything would be as he want !	1

most research indicate social deprivation as be main cause of crime couple nowadays with drugsso why be gun be blame for cause crime ! i have be say this for year . criminal have always have gun ban or notthat be the exact point of this thread . gun ban / control do not stop the criminal , endanger the populace . if you want to argue anti - gun . do not support the side of us `` redneck - hillbilly - gunnuts `` that you think be so stupid . but the number of criminal that have firearm can be reduce . in developed nation that have very strict gun law there be a lot less criminal obtain and use gun to commit crime . how do your theory explain that ?	0

so it ’ s the scientific community that set up communication within a society , and then the dumb old common peasant come along and screw it all up ? hahaha – sorry but i ’ m not convinced . i ’ m not “ in ” science , other than unwillingly contribute my tax dollar – however small the percentage be – to a social agenda of those who control the scientific community . i ’ m permit to have “ theory ” about it . emoticonxangel when the word “ theory ” be apply to a very wide range of subject , it ’ s not fair to label someone who question one theory a rejecter of all theory . that ’ s what the link in the opening post do – that ’ s not rational discourse , it ’ s not secular open inquiry , it ’ s not a search for truth or knowledge . it ’ s political / atheist rhetoric - look at the bottom of the page and whose name do we see ? richard dawkins , what a surprise . and a quick google of “ edgar pearlstein ” show a sarah palin hat atheist liberal just like him . emoticonxrolleyes science have a role in the control of the people atheist do , but it doesn ’ t necessarily mean that they represent science . you haven ’ t gotten in over your head – most who post here don ’ t know much about science . tq doesn ’ t , and of course he ’ ll tell you that i don ’ t . there ’ s a big difference between science , and the creation / evolution controversy . many atheist who seem to be interested in science be actually only interested in it to the point that it help them feel “ intellectually fulfil ” , to discredit religion . some of the best reading on the creation / evolution controversy isn ’ t write by scientist , but by philosopher who have do just enough scientific homework on the subject to keep a clear focus on the controversy , without confuse it with too much detail . michael ruse and bradley monten be two excellent atheist author on the subject . religious author , practically too many to name . william dembski , david berlinski , phillip johnson , cornelius hunter , many others . you would do well to read anything by any of these people . far too many young people seem to make the mistake of get most all of their information from rabid atheist who be also degreed biologist , like richard dawkins . he ’ s become a celebrity , and most degreed biologist who be not rabid atheist be a little to timid to take him on in a very direct way , without fear of discrimination , academic or otherwise . michael behe be one of the few who have be somewhat successful at it , not in avoid discrimination , but in his ability to make a comfortable living in spite of it . read “ the edge of evolution ” , or “ darwin ’ s black box ” sometime . happy some irreducible complex structure , but not all of them . for atheist , that ’ s good enough . but it ’ s not good enough for everyone . in behe ’ s word ; “ … as biochemist have begin to examine apparently simple structure like cilium and flagellum , they have discover staggering complexity , with dozen or even hundred of precisely tailor part . … as the number of required part increase , the difficulty of gradually put the system together skyrocket , and the likelihood of indirect scenario plummet . ” behe write this in 1996 , and since then it have only gotten bad for the atheist , no matter how much they dance . when it come to all the example that behe have provide in both his first book , and his second book , it have be show to be able to evolve naturally . that mean , in principle , ic system can evolve . if you do not believe so , bring forth the i.c . system of your choice . to say ' but you do not know all the answer ' be just the logical fallacy know as ' argument from ignorance ' . behe bring a system up that he claim be ic . the pathway for evolution be discover , and behe try another one . how dishonest can you get ? the concept be falsify .	0
and neither do trebor post any evidence of his claim . why be not you question him ? but i suspect that trebor have ask those with good recollection of the time than he have and they have confirm for him that what i say be true , which be why he have not come back and refute my response to him . i know this info be true . i just could not find anything on - line that state when isaiah be drop from the traditional reading in american jewish temple . sorry . two reason : first , i come from a jewish family , and i have never hear of this before . now , i will grant that nothing say that i should have , but this be news to me . second , and more importantly , trebor be not the person who make the positive claim ; you be . it be your burden of proof . no one here can blame me for question your bare assertion give your history with falsehood . so if he do not respond in a mere three hour , you declare victory ? how about you call me presumptuous again ? emoticonxrolleyes for once you acknowledge that you be not able to back up your claim . congratulation . try it next time without accuse somebody of be cowardly and misleading .	1

in the following example that you provide : what be the context of the word ' truncate ' ? the way i read it - it be talk about a truncated string of code or something . what be truncate ? . * more than 100 lpl gene mutation have be identify , the majority of which cause loss of enzymatic function . in contrast to this , the naturally occur lpls447x variant be associate with increase lipolytic function and an anti - atherogenic lipid profile and can therefore be regard as a gain - of - function mutation . this notion combine with the fact that 20 % of the general population carry this prematurely truncated lpl . * the original molecule have some lipolytic function , but remove some amino acid from it , in the right place , make it fit well into the substrate , and thereby greatly increase its functionality . barbarian observes : we think it would take roughly a million year for bacteria to evolve enzyme capable of digest nylon ( because the compound be so different than any they be able to digest ) but it take less than a century . .	0
and i say you be both spiritually - challenged and do not know what you be talk about . jesus be lord and all who deny him be antichrist ( 1 john 2:22 ) . and anybody who ' s a trebor - trekkie can not be all there anyway . ah yes , the ' let us pull a smug and self serve quote out of context from the bible and use it as in insult , therefore god exist ' routine . that arrogant method of use self congratulatory bible quote to insult and denigrate your opponent be neither an effective debate technique , or do it help convince those people on the boarder line to convert to christianity . it do drive them away , so please , be my guest and keep on try to use it . i figure the ratio of people you drive away from christianity to those people who be convert to christianity from you must be way lop side .	1

' and since when do grammar depend on the person say it rather than the statement be say ? you claim that taz do not screw up the grammar , yet i do . yet the statement be identical . how be you address what i say when you have completely ignore everything i list ? more yelling . no actual argument . the whole point of that be to show you make large number of asinine statement . do you reject that ? red bold statement do not make a winning argument .	1

surely you understand that this be not the same as provide evidence for creationism . disprove one theory do not prove another . all it do be disprove a theory . yes i do understand this . but you must admit that the instantaneous formation of a living organism , even an extremely primitive one , complete with the complexity of the dna code as a result of random encounter of atom and molecule be a little too much to buy . there be evidence right there for creationism . only intelligence could have form such an elaborate complex system for the structure of life and its propagation .	0

good god ! i well know the difference between an aryan person and the cult of arianism . there would be absolutely no reason at all to discuss a relatively unknown and ancient religious cult in a junior high level history book . but all sort of hidden reason to bring up the topic of aryan in a racist southern state . allright , well then i think it ' s odd too , arians would have make more sense . i be surprise they be consider obscure , the council of nicea be historically consider one of the define moment of the early christian church , and the arian controvery be it ' s main event . for the record , they be discuss in my high school , that ' s why i be make sure .	0

this be a statement write by someone who obviously have not read scripture . one of the most astonising `` proofs `` if you will , that the bible be of supernatural origin , be predictive prophecy . science can not , as you claim , `` explain `` everything , and it have no natural explanation for the prediction make in scripture . how can science explain through statistical probablity the over 600 prophecy in biblical writing that have come to pass ? also , how can it explain how supposedly uneducated people ( uneducated in the way of modern science ) write about astronomy as if they know about the universe as we do today . how could they have describe the hydrological cycle as we have only come to know it recently ? ecclesiastes 1 : 6 the wind go toward the south , and turn around to the north ; the wind whirl about continually , and come again on its circuit . how do they know that the earth `` hang on nothing `` when the accepted norm of the day do not even accept that possibility ? job 26 : 7 he stretch out the north over empty space ; he hang the earth on nothing . how do they know that the `` vapor `` of the earth rise to create moisture , that be seed by lightning with nitrogen and then fall as rain to fertilze the soil ? jeremiah 10:13 when he utter his voice , there be a multitude of water in the heaven : “ and he cause the vapor to ascend from the end of the earth . he make lightning for the rain , he bring the wind out of his treasury . ” hydrothermal vent [ 4 ] be describe in two book of the bible write before 1 4 0 0 bc — more than 3,000 year before their discovery by science . genesis 7:11 in the six hundredth year of noah ' s life , in the second month , the seventeenth day of the month , on that day all the fountain of the great deep be break up , and the window of heaven be open . even though the bible be not a scientific text book and do not purport to be , nowhere be it scientifically inaccurate . in addition , many of the scientific idea you be so impressed with be nothing new to the bible . it be speak of these thing long before modern science spoke of them . the story go `` they ( scientist ) be slowly work their way to the mountain ' s peak painstakingly measure and analyze every step that they take . after many year of research , they finally arrive at the top of the mountain , scale over its leading edge , only to find a group of theologian sit there with the answer all along . `` once one be adept at find evidence after a conclusion be presume , all sort of `` proofs `` reveal themselves . what ' s next , nostradamus ?	1

the 1 4 th amendment make the 1 st amendment applicable to state government as well . 1 4 th amendment : `` the validity of the public debt of the united state , authorize by law . `` be there something in that you find unclear ? so lets see , you refer to how the 1 st amendment apply to the state , post the 1 4 th amendment privilege and immunity clause and then ask if i think something be unclear . of course the privilege and immunity clause be often mistake to have incorporate the 1 st amendment by people who do not know what they be talk about but this be merely coincidence because you randomly quote part of the 1 4 th amendment but imply it all . now if i change it to what it say above would you feel that be an accurate statement ? probably , consider you do not seem to understand a blatant difference between `` original understanding `` and `` original constitution ) . your pride ruin you my friend .	1

sound like a fact which have be blow out of all proportion - possibly by the pro - gun side attempt to ridicule it . it be a fact , however , that the presence of a gun can increase aggression level in individual . see other time i have bring this up , here ( to the end of the thread ) and here ( again , that post till the end of the thread ) . you should really think about what you say before you say it . i have hear this before and its garbish , i have be around and own gun my whole life and i have never , not even once , have the thought of get a gun just because someone # # # # # # me off . i would never use a gun on a person unless that person be a viable threat to my life , such as come at me with a knife for example .	1

i would like to add , i do not necessarily agree with the health care reform that obama pass , but i will applaud the fact that he actually pass something concern health care . all the previous president since reagan have promise health care and never deliver . they run on health care , and once elect do nothing . at least obama keep his promise to address the subject . maybe it could have be a good plan , but what we have now be well than the nothing we have have under mostly republicans . clinton be the only democrat who also fail to deliver . to be honest , i be surprise it be that hard to give a corporate handout . any big insurance company and big drug company be delight since their competition will now be squash and the average joe will delight in their weaker care at a high price . but hey , a for effort , right ? emoticonxrolleyes you do not get point for fail to deliver or deliver a failure in my opinion .	1

abortion hurt much more than they heal . not just phsyically ( side effect can occure month afterward ) but psychologically as well . guilt , depression , so forth . in my view , abortion be murder , one way or the other and rare extreme case do not justify its legality . even the rape victim get a good chance than the baby do . they be at least alive while they kill their baby . that in itself will eat at the person for year until they find some way of forgive themselves . i believe these testimony to be real , and i feel sorry for those victim who feel obligate because of family relation ' reputation to kill their own child . it really be sad . what i have be say here , and after awhile - the guilt , depression , etc - will get bury , deep & deep - but no negative / damage experience leave people . they stay quietly in the background - computer base - until , as you say : hopefully , the person `` find some way of forgive themselves `` , right . but what about in the mean - time ? - and we know , from research & quite a number of healer , that rot ( inside a person ) be damage . and often in very unsuspecting way . much good to life benevolently , in the first place . annie	0

it do not do this , because proponent of natural selection rule out ' end ' . other than survival , and survival simply come about because organism survive ( hence the tautology of `` survival of the fit `` which darwin himself felt be a superior phrase to `` natural selection `` ) . as be point out in some of your own quotation , survival be not an ' end ' of natural selection . natural selection be the differential reproductive success of organism with more favorable suite of characteristic . it be a statistical tendency . individual organism may work to survive , but they also work to reproduce . that ' s as close as it get to `` purpose . `` and as you know , darwin ' s favor term be natural selection . he never use the phrase `` survival of the fit `` without also make a reference to natural selection . the opposite be not the case . since darwin ' s time `` survival of the fit `` have be reject by evolutionary biologist because it be such a poor representation of the extent of the theory .	0
i say consider the history of the issue . marriage in america and in the modern british tradition , and in the modern western tradition be a fundamental right of free people and have be so for hundred of year . if a state try to overturn that system by ban marriage or even by refuse to acknowledge and provide for civil marriage , i do not think it would be allow . well , if history be bind we would still have slavery . and abortion be illegal for that matter . something be do for a long time do not mean it make it in the constitution . i do not know which part of the constitution have a `` preserve history `` clause .	1
first paragraph : `` christianity be live a lifstyle pattern after the teaching , action and philosophy of christ . `` sure , not a bad definition . `` in order to do this , you must accept that the record of christ ' s life be fact . `` every single word in the gospel ? no , not at all . remember , the work which become the new testament be around for century before they be actually compile into the bible . and none of the original still exist . who know what change be make to the account of jesus ' s life before they be finally compile . for example , look at matthew 10:34 `` do not think that i come to bring peace on earth . i do not come to bring peace but a sword . `` do not sound much like jesus , do it ? it certainly do not fit into the picture that ' s generally paint of jesus . in the end the new testament be write and compile by mistake prone people . some may believe that it ' s the unadulterated word of god , but look at the above passage it ' s also easy to believe that it ' s also the work of common people . the rest of the paragraph rather depend on accept that line , and i believe i have show that a reasonable person might not , so i be go to skip to your next paragraph . so what about jesus ' life be credible if the source be unreliable ? be it that jesus didnt walk on water but he feed 5000 with 5 loaf ? be it that he didnt forgive the samaritan harlot but he raise lazarus from the dead ? what do the author get right ? i mean , i can easily believe jesus say he come to bring a sword and not peace . but you dont . so how do we possibly pattern our life accord to how jesus live if we dont know whether what they record be actually what he do ? it be necessary to believe that the gospel be true , otherwise you can not follow a pattrn you dont have .	0

if drug be more accessable we would likly have far less crime and far more drug adicts . i think you might want to check your logic here . as far as i be aware , drug addict cause a great deal of crime to support their habit . as you be , i be not terribly fond of police someone ' s personal habit , but when drug be the motivate force behind burglary , assault and mugging and addict carry disease such aid and tuberculosis then mean of curtail this should be explore . this may include police or control the supply of drug to an area to cut down and the amount of drug sell , and thus less crime to support few habit . easy access to drug be , logically , part of the problem .	0

that ' s an interesting insight . ( i be go to have to borrow that story . tong i can not help but wonder for some people if the reason they `` mature `` on the issue of heterosexual sex have to do more with the fact that they start want to do it themselves . a desire to partake in the action , as oppose to actual mature development , cause them to shift their attitude towards heterosexuality . to me , that ' s one of the reason christianity ( in general ) have such a `` tolerance `` for divorce , which jesus speak out against explicitly , while not as much tolerance for homosexuality . they want to do the divorce thing or sympathize with the desire for it , so suddenly it ' s more `` tolerate `` . emoticonxrolleyes exactly , they be big on condeming the sin of those other guy . it make them feel well about themselves . also , it be always a good idea to have a vitriolic campaign about something that will never change so they will always have an enemy - homo be not go to disappear , abortion will never be make illegal . that ' s how the religious right recruit folks - get ' em all indignant about the `` others `` and they never notice they be be fleece by the fat little pastor .	1

ok , i will play . assume a fetus be a person , it depend on the body and organ of the host to live . it will put the host ' s body through stress and discomfort for month , possibly even cause it to die , at the very least it will change that body forever . no person can be compel to give organ , tissue , or blood against their will , even to save the life of another . this be so fundamental that not even condemn prisoner can be so compelled . force a woman to use her organ to support another person be the same thing and should be forbid the same way . it be clear that the profetallifers wish to make the pregnant woman a slave to her fetus .	0

happygrl35 , the premise from the man ' s perspective be the same arguement pro - choicers argue , all they be do be legally terminate a mass of tissue , not a human be . accord to pro - choicers , life be not conceive at conception , so if i man after have sex with a woman and the woman become pregnant , she be not pregnant with a baby , she be pregnant with a cell that can `` develop `` into a baby . if a man say ' s i opt out of fatherhood prior to the development of a human be , then he too like the woman already have , should have the opt - out option . a woman can do with her body what she so choose , like she do , however , everyone include woman must mitigate their own damage . if a woman who be pregnant with a few `` cell cluster `` and she so choose to let the pregnancy of cell develop into a human be , she be allow to do so , but she cause the development of a human baby not the man , and should be solely liable for such creation . remember , when the man leave after have sex , he do not create a human be accord to pro - choicers , if at most he create a `` cell `` . accord to pro - choicers , cell do not translate into a human life . a male should have an opt - out period just like the woman , before the cell become a human be . emoticonxhoho god , i love it . pro - choicers do not even want to live by their own word . i be try to understand their position . its a `` cluster of cell `` , `` a mass of tissue `` , `` not a human be `` , `` no heartbeat `` `` no brainwave therefore , not a human be yet `` , so if a man say ' s i opt out of fatherhood prior to the creation of a human be then , like his female counterpart , should be able terminate his parental duty , that he never create , she do . he and she only create a cell not a human . first of all a man can not terminate tissue he be not carry . the father can opt out all he want but when that fetus become a born person he be responsible just like the mother be .	1
brooklyn , new york ( vbs . tv ) - - on january 22 , 2006 , the new york time report that all foreign journalist be be ban from pakistan ' s tribal area , which have be call `` the most dangerous place in the world . `` a week before that , the cia fire missile remotely from a predator aircraft into the waziristan tribal area . they be hop to eradicate a bunch of al qaeda operative . instead , they kill 18 woman and child . one week before that , i arrive in pakistan to visit darra adamkhel , the massive open - air market locate deep in the tribal area , where a frighteningly high percentage of islamic holy warrior go to buy their gun . gain access to the tribal area be next to impossible . it take month of pre - planning with the consul general of pakistan in montreal and top official in peshawar . they repeatedly deny us entry because , accord to them , the pakistani army have too many `` sensitive operation `` go on in that region . without my personal advantage ( a family friendship with the governor of the northwest frontier province ) , we never would have get in . the government assign me and my team a political agent name naeem afridi . he be bear and raise in the tribal area . he take care of us while we be there , and he be a godsend . you can not do anything in this part of the world without someone like naeem . our driver stop at a security point just outside the town center , where we be introduce to the frontier agency militia , six angry - dad - look guy with ak and sidearms . they become our personal bodyguard , and follow us through the tight warren of gun shop and factory , barren little brick room where upward of 1,000 gun be manufacture every day . most of the work be do by hand . the vendor be pashtun , who be basically the tough people in the world . they comprise the majority of the mujahideen who kick the soviet out of afghanistan in the late ' 8 0 s . these day , the town be rumor to be completely overrun by the taliban . they purchase the gun , then cross the border to fight the u.s. army in afghanistan , or they drive through the mountain to the south to fight the pakistani army . this summer , i go back to pakistan , and find that the fuse on this powder keg have become even shorter . the pakistani army have surge more troop into the tribal area , attempt to eradicate the taliban and al qaeda . the u.s. and british troop be attempt to do the same thing on the other side of the border in afghanistan . meanwhile , pakistan itself have see violence spread to its major urban center , where extremist have be detonate bomb and take over police station . but at the same time , there be a cultural explosion take place , a vibrant art scene and metal and rock band pop up everywhere . the whole situation have become ultra charge by the fact that there be ton of news channel operate uncensored by the insanely corrupt government . for pakistan , it ' s a volatile , turbulent , and fascinate moment in time . so . what be all that bull * * * * about terrorist exploit america ' s `` weak gun control law `` in order to amass arsenal of deadly weapon ? it seem to me that they do not need undercover operative to come to america , forge document and undergo background check just to get civilian weapon . they have get their own arm manufacturing plant over there , they can make whatever they need or want .	0

this entire issue be deal with on this threat here , start at post250 . you either do not read my post thoroughly , or be intentional misrepresent me . post 250 ( which i have actually read before start this thread ) be nothing but dametel ramble about homology between vertebra embryo . that have absolutely nothing to do with the unexplained homology that the denton talk about . evolution simply can not , reasonably speak , account for the homology between your arm and leg , among other example .	0

you can stop with the word game , you know very well what i be talk about . but i will clarify . congress have the power to declare war . but congress can not make war . you be imply that congress can go into session and just vote for a declaration of war without the president be involve . it may give them this power under the constitution but the constitution be vague at best and in the absence of a clear directive they normally follow the precedent that be set by the first declaration of war . and since every single time we have issue a declaration of war the president of the u . s . initiate it that be the precedent we follow . and let me add . the president can veto a declaration of war as well . i be not play word game . you say congress do not have the power to declare war ; how else be i suppose to read that ? you mean congress do not run the war . you clarify , end of story .	0

because africa be not one big homogeneous ecosystem . there be jungle , plain , desert , swamp . himps live in the jungle be not in competition with himps that start migrate out onto the plain . their food source be different , their territory be different . the more suited to plain - dwell we become , the less attractive a prospect it be to return to the jungle . pretty straightforward , really . but himps living in the jungle be in competition with other himps which do not migrate to the plain . and pressure from predator , climate and change in the ecosystem should have continue to force the need or desire to control their environment as our line of himp grow to do . my point be that with all of the same basic tool to start out with such as finger , opposable thumb and walk upright , there be no reason why only our line evolve to the level that human being have attain with the same hundred of million of year , and the same pressure push us all forward , or towards extinction .	0

i never say we have to vote for her . if it come between her and hillary , i ' d vote hillary . actually , i ' d probably vote bob barr . but it ' s unfair to say she do not have enough experience when she certainly do ( or , at least more than obama do ) . obama have 1 thing that palin certainly do not have be the fantastic ability to turn crowd in favor of him . obama have amazing speech ability that surpass palin without a doubt in my mind . palin also like to go off subject almost as if she be avoid certain question . what be experience if you can not even thoroughly explain your position ?	0
regard the exodus passage : why should men fight each other , hit a pregnant woman , and thereby cause her to miscarry or give birth prematurely ( take your pick on which be the good translation ) be consider `` abortion `` in the first place ? it seem to me the position of the woman be rather different in the two scenario ! i be not say abortion be always morally acceptable , not by a longshot . but i be also not say it never be , either . it be not offer to make that assertion at all . it be offer to show that god value the life of the unborn if he will demand that a man responsible for cause its death in the womb be hold accountable by pay the ultimate price .	0

would you agree that the logic be flaw in both case ? whether you say `` you go against god you reap what you so `` or `` you preach hate you reap what you sow `` ( in short ) ? galatians 6 : 7 be not deceive ; god be not mock : for whatsoever a man soweth , that shall he also reap . the whole concept of `` reap what you sow `` be a christian concept . and now you be claim it ' s flaw ? while i feel the need to continually reiterate that what this guy do in harm others be wrong ( primarily to avoid the troll from misrepresent my point ) , the validity of the generic concept of `` reap what you sow `` be amazingly poignant . people typically do not just go nut and harm people for no reason . columbine saw the kid try to harm other kid who harass them . while some people may be jump the gun in try to assign `` sow `` , i be also amaze that others be so unwilling to inspect the question of whether or not the church involve truly do `` sow `` . 	0

why would god want a cowboy to spread his message ? after all , cowboy have the stigma of be arrogant , stubborn , oblivious to subtle cultural trait , not the delicate cautious type , so and on so forth . seem like a bad vehicle for god . because gc hears thing all woggly . the message from god be for shepherd to tend to ignorant , mindless sheep . but , with dope - smoker ear , and american ignorance it translate into a cowboy . who rustle cattle . and head them to a quick slaughter . it ' s like , when the anti - chist make his appearance , i will be god slaughterman . effectively and efficiently remove tru - believahs from the world . cause god forget some in his rapture thingy ( i forget how the logic of these event be suppose to play out . ) um . be not we overdue for that bloke to return already ? i be get antsy for the 2 nd come and all the excitement that lead up to that glorious event . think hold my breath will make it happen any sooner ?	1

 buzz wrong , it ' s the conduct of both party that need to be reign in . and that start with good parenting . for example , when you have a healthy marriage , child will generally model themselves after their parent ( disclaimer note i say ' generally ' there be exception , however disclaimer ) . why do so many lifer just skip right past the pregnancy as if it have no impact ? i be not talk about parent . i do not advocate force anyone to parent . ever . that be why i support safe haven law , sign away of parental right , etc . i be talk about pregnancy . only a woman can be pregnant and should have the ultimate say in whether or not she be . it be her body , not your ' s , not the state ' s , not the church ' s , and not the fetus ' . when it come to pregnancy - you wish only to legislate the body / reproductive organ of woman . i bet you would not advocate chemical castration for any male who be not yet ready to be a parent .	0

this statement be wrong . people from hundred of year before jesus be bear prophesy that a baby would be bear , in bethlehem , of a virgin . there be over 50 more prophesies that be make about his life , and the sacrafice he make to pay for the sin of man , and the big one of all . he completely fufilled scripture when he rise from the dead . these men be inspire by jesus , god , how can you argue that he be not the christ ? the odds of one man fill all the prophesies be impossible . and these scripture have be unchanged for the past 2000 - 2500 approx year ! thats proof for me that jesus exist and that he be god . pm me if you like . the egyptian predict his birth , death , wwi , wwii , and they have predict the supposed end of the world . be you say that this religion be wrong ? they predict a lot more that i have not put that have come true .	0
not at all , it ' s just that other poster that often agree with you in just about every way want to call themselves conservative ( they have call clinton a conservative , bush a liberal , etc . ) so it do get difficult to sort it all out sometimes . it be only difficult to sort out if you be a neocon and fail to recognize that neocon be nothing but militant liberal . bush be by far the most liberal president we have have for at least 20 year . maybe you need to research traditional conservative value .	1
archangel be right on this one . it ' s completely absurd to compare a tumour to a healthy fetus , which have a separate blood system , and in a relatively short space of time will be an independent person . archie be not right - he have an opinion , as we all do . pro - lifer seem to want the definition of human with attendant right to begin at conception . the blastocyst be now turn into a tumour . so the pro - lifer can now alter their view on what constitute ' human ' as and when it suit their purpose . forget the emotive view of what an embryo / foetus look like : some think that as long as it have appendage and look human , then it be . it be not . it ' s still a parasitic organism dependant on the host mother . you can not deny that . contraception v . abortion be a separate issue : in the meantime , the host mother should be the final arbiter of what happen to her body .	0
i can understand your point that , in the absolute , metaphysical sense , we can never be 100.00 % sure of any of our knowledge . just because all human always have experience the existence of the world , do not mean that it be 100.00 % certain , just that the probability that it be true approaches 100.00 % ( say , 99.9999999 % ) . the great the amount of evidence , the closer that certainty be to 100.00 % . that 0.0000001 % leave room for obsurd scenario - such as that an omnicient be be cause us all to merely imagine our reality , or the scenario of the movie `` the matrix `` . these can be fun to ponder ( especially in a social situation after a few drink wink ) , but no one take them seriously . if anyone do seriously live by the idea that the world may not exist , they would quickly do something stupid and die , or change their mind . no - one experience the existence of an outside world . explanation such as the matrix can explain sense impression as well as some concept of ' external reality ' . we have no more evidence for one than the other . the fact no - one take them seriously be a psychological point about human being , nothing to do with reality per se .	0

in a way , take right away be an american value since we have prescribe method for do it . for instance , we have legislature which pose authority to remove a large number of what you likely consider to be right . here be just a small number that come to mind : 1 ) right to murder2 ) right to own slaves3 ) right to rape4 ) right to abuse children5 ) right to vote6 ) right to smoke ( if you be under 18 ) 7 ) right to drink ( 1 8 th amendment ) happy right to engage in certain activity in public9 ) right to drive as fast as one wants10 ) right to dump dangerous chemical in the near riverthe list go on really . the fact be that you do not object to take right away in principle , you only object to take away those right that you wish to retain . that be quite inconsistent . where do you get the idea that one have a right to perform an abortion anyway ? in what universe be there a right to murder ? unfortunately , we in the united state have only recently recognize that abuse child and own slave be not a right . and , only recently have woman enjoy the right to vote in the united state . what certain activity be forbid in public ? some of the conservative red state have only recently decree that there should be speek limit . not for safety reason , of course . and , george walker bush have guarantee the right of corporation to dump dangerous chemical into lake and river and the ocean .	0

originally post by debategirl88 1 . jesus do not go to heaven he go to hell . he couldnt go to heaven because he have all of the sin of the world on him . if ya know anything about the bible you would know that sin do not go to heaven . that mean jesus spent 3 day and 3 night in hell . three day ? non christian supposedly spend an eternity in hell , not the weekend .	1
cappy : how sad that you be unable to get this through your twisted brain . the woman with the help of a man , determine a pregnancy . the natural course of any pregnancy be 40 week of gestation then live birth . that be the normal , natural course . a woman want to end that pregnancy at any point of the gestational period be go against the normal course of nature . the government , in such case , in the interest of the continuation of the human specie , should be able to assist these pregnancy through to live birth and make adoption easy , not enable murder . ok , so if we be go to let everything take the `` normal course of nature `` , then let just let everyone die . have cancer ? too bad , its the natural course of nature that you die . what about heart failure ? sorry , no paddle of life for you . we be go to let nature take its course . just like your beloved pope , nature be not always right .	1
guilty of the rape i be not dispute ( do not know anything about those case ) , but why do that automatically make him guilty of the rape and murder for which he be execute ? no , but i read some of the evidence and it look pretty solid . if this person be sentence to life in prison without parole would you question the verdict ?	1
libertarian be social liberal and economic conservative . they want decreased regulation on society ( legalize drug , gay marriage , etc . ) . and here be the crux of the matter where i think libertarian be miss it : as one founding father say , `` there can be no liberty without virtue . `` someone else once say , `` intemperate men can never be free because their passion give rise to their binding `` . if the god of the bible be right , a nation which legalize sin and intemperance lose the favor of god . and when the sin of a nation reach their fullness ( in god ' s eye ) , that disfavor can turn to judgment ( genesis 15:16 , deuteronomy chapter 28 - `` the blessing of obedience and curse of disobedience ) . therefore , while many of the libertarian mean well on liberal social issue , they nevertheless either do not see the big picture , or they do not believe it will occur .	1
for someone seemingly hellbent on accuse atheist of not understand any other point of view , it ' s pretty damn idiotic to threaten us with assertion that we know be not true . this accomplish nothing besides give you the self - satisfaction of tout your religiosity so that you can pat yourself on the back . what make you think they be not true ? jesus arise from the dead . that ' s one of the most well attest to fact in ancient history , whether you want to casually sweep it under the rug or not . many skeptic set out to prove the story of christ to be a fairy tale . none succeed and a number become believer . you guy be play with absolute fire . if you be wrong ( and you be ) , you be screw big time . big time and forever . do you feel lucky ? well , do you ?	0
in short , i think this analogy need to be reconsider because of one important fact : a person who be brain - dead will never recover from that state no matter how much medical treatment be give , whereas an embryo who be `` brain - dead `` most certainly will fully recover from that state in a relatively short amount of time if leave alone . what you be talk about here be the potential to exist be important . i would personally also think that potential existence be important , but not nearly as important as an exist person . after all , unfertilized egg and sperm also have the potential to become full people but no one be concern about their loss . for many of us it be the actual mentally - exist person that be most important . for both the ' braniac `` case you present and for the early term fetus , if there be no reason to kill it , then do not . however , if there be a contest between the right of a living , exist person and the right of either potential person , then i think the right of the live person win out .	0
about as much ' soverienty ' legitimation as hitler have when he be butcher the jew . no cause ? you forget about try to murder bush 41 . no cause ? you forget about him fund palestinian terrorist at $ 25k a pop . no cause ? you forget about invade kuwait . no cause ? he kick out the u . n . inspector . no cause ? he fire at our airplane who patrol the no - fly zone . no cause ? the mass graf and stalinist government ? and these be just the thing we know for certain . that wasn ' t a reason why we fight hitler . in fact , if you will remember many in the state do not believe that occur until they saw the picture . hardly a reason to invade . unless you ' d like to flip it around and say that every country who ' s leader we try to murder have the same right . emoticonxrolleyes how be that our problem ? oh yes , it ' s not . as i recall , we kick him out , beat him up , put him under sanction and virtually remove any ability to do anything of revelance . do not that mean we have to invade north korea ? emoticonxrolleyes that ' s be dealt with already . rehash argument be worthless . huh . stalinist govermemnt . remind me of the dictator the us put in power in latin america . happy the mass graf also be deal with . but then again , you clearly do not understand the me culture .	1
the term ' bear arm ' usually referred military service at the time of the writing of the second amendment . this be evident from the first draft of the second amendment in which james madison state , ' no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arm shall be compel to render military service in person . ' although the pro - gun lobby like to equate ' bear arm ' with carry a gun , to james madison the term mean ' to render military service . ' lastly , what arm be they founder refer to ? musket , not machine gun , semi - automatic assault rifle nor uzis . obviously , use the second amendment to oppose law regulate such weapon be highly questionably . `` case v united state , 131 f . 2 d 916 ( 1 st cir . 1942 ) , cert . deny sub nom . , velazquez v . u . s , 319 u.s. 770 ( 1943 ) . basically , the us curcuit court uphold that the second amendment do not apply to weapon that could not be carry by an individual .	0

we now still have light and dark moth . the only thing that have change be the population ratio , assumably by * natural selection * . exactly . that the change in moth color be due to natural selection be first pose in about 1896 by j.w . tutt . the funny thing be that as pollution increase , the moth turn black , and then as the pollution be clean up , they turn white again . carbonaria have become pretty scarce .	0

head far down that path . if the `` right `` belongs to the child , then the `` right `` obviously also do not belong to those oppose to gay . more specifically , the `` right `` to waive potential parent as ineligible do not belong to those who be oppose to gay . the `` right `` would belong to the child to decide who he / she want , and it would be a big usurpment of this right of the child to deny the child the option of gay parent than it be to present him with the option . well , this get rather complicate . a very young child do not get to choose his or her adoptive parent . who decide on who adopt whom depend on the kind of adoption and the policy of the particular adoption system . in private domestic adoption , the birth mother usually get to decide on who will adopt her baby . the foster care system be organize differently , and international adoption be different still and depend on the country from which the child be be adopt . so it ' s pretty much impossible to generalize about adoption policy and practice . they vary greatly . the point be that the purpose of adoption be to protect the right of the child .	0
of course it be know that wild animal that be sick just die from natural selection ( they get eat , or they do not manage to find food ) and even livestock , if it have some disease , can be cull to prevent outbreak of disease . in human it be different though , there be quarantine zone to prevent spread of certain disease . however , religion be sort of disease , but mind disease which can not be prevent to spread by some quarantine , but only by some great culling , and restrict it ' s spreading . religion be so embedded within ( weak ) human mind that it can not be remove normally ( e . g . non violently , as those emotional weakling would call it ) but only by eradication . i really hope you be joke . extremism be a disease , but not religion . religion can be , and be , for the most part , peaceful .	0
the only reason be natural selection . evolution be not need . not need ? it be evolution . the collor of the moth be genetic - cause by 2 allele of a single gene . the frequency of those allele be observe to change in the population of moth over many generation . it be by definition , evolution .	0

however , idea for law come from a morality . in fact , our constitution do . to sit around and watch people die . that be something i ' d rather not do and i be force to . that be a specious argument . the constitution be not an embodiment of what be good and evil for human to do , but of what be of value in a free society . the constitution do not judge the goodness and badness of human character . idea for law come from morality ? the concept of morality come from a desire to survive as we evolve . so you see the law prevent someone from interfere with your life as the same as the law allow someone to interfere with your life ?	0
would not it be nice if you do not overuse the word oppress . if you really believe that gay be oppress then believe me you ain ' t see nothing in the world as yet . try look at some country in the world and you will see what oppression really mean . i be amuse by how some people can look at an article of an anti - gay marriage advocate attack a gay marriage advocate , and the person read the article want to focus on what qualifies as ' oppression ' and how gay could have it bad . emoticonxdonno just out of curiousity , do you have any comment as to whether or not the attack be wrong ?	1

well this be what i be say . the probability of a and b in one organism i very low . and the probability of a and b in many generation be low than just a . actually , if you look at the example i have give , that ' s false . the probability of a in one organism may be low , but the probability of a in some organism approach 100 % as the population and the number of generation get large . and if a be useful and come to dominate the population , then the probability of an ab individual appear then also tend towards 100 % . in the example above , the chance of an ab mutant occurring , if a and b be substantially useful mutation , be almost a dead certainty . it would be amaze if they do not stack . so say that ab occur be less likely than a be mislead at best , downright wrong at bad . behe be clearly misapplying probability theory .	0

i think the crazy come first and the zealootry be just a symptom . i see ocd and mania be zealotry . obssessiveness be not healthy - regardless of what your obsess over . also , one need to be careful about the lable . for example , nt everyone who oppose gay marriage for religious reason be a zealout . i would say most be not . take easy and jp . both have religious reason for oppose gay marriage ( that should not be the problem of anyone outside their faith , but i digress . ) , however i would only call easy a zealot . jp may be an occasionally obnoxious conservative apologist who can even teeter on redneck from imie to time , but he be no zealout . i be a redneck because , unlike you , i believe in self - determination ? ! emoticonxwow	1
no i do not think that all life come from a single - celled ancestor in the distant past . the first reason for this be my faith in the inherent word of god . secondly , throughout my college education ( major in molecular biology ) i have observe the complexity of the single - cell , and find it impossible to believe that it occur by accident ( though that may not be the best choice of word ) . the more and more we learn about cellular structure , the more complex we find it be and how these complexity be require in order for life to be present at all . so , faith and argument from incredulity . if you find it impossible please state exactly what part be impossible . then maybe an actual scientist could take over . major in molecular biology ? not even a full degree ; not like your go to do anything original .	1
hello everyone , i be a high school student seek help . me and my partner be about to enter a debate on firearm , and we already know that we be for gun . can you all just tell me if you be for gun or not and a short reason why ? thank you . well if you already know you be for gun , then you should know the basic reason , right ? or be this an uninformed decision ( i heard from my friend that gun be good ) ? but basically other people have say it . they be protect by the constitution , they generally result in low crime rate , and they can be use for defense as well as hunt . oh , but the burden of proof be not on the people support gun , but those who wish to ban gun . most argument for ban gun be easily refutable .	1
originally post by unkerpauliethe fact be that evil and good exist , and that we can by no mean use the existence of evil to conclude that god doesnt exist , because by definition the existence of evil substantiates that good exists and therefore actually support the argument for god first off , no one say that if there be evil , there can not be a god . they say that if there ' s evil , then god can not be omnipotent and all benevolent . let us keep the topic straight . also , i see no way in which the existence of good bolster the argument that god exist . i could posit the existence of a god of popcorn , and then say `` look , here ' s some popcorn , my god must be real ! `` somehow , i do not think that would convince you .	1

i be assume static because that ' s the case i be interested in . in real term , i be hold a ball ; it ' s motionless with respect to the earth . i let go . what about warped space make the ball move towards the earth ? that ' s the specific question that i be try to get an answer to . yes , the marble should roll towards the ball regardless of the orientation of the sheet . if you use a horizontal sheet then the analogy work as long as you do it in the presence of gravity , but that smack of a circular definition to me . an analogy for gravity that require gravity do not convince me , or explain anything to me . so you be ask how a gravitational field overcome the intertia of a less massive object place within say field ? i do not know but your question kind of confused me : in this example the only reason the object be not move be because you be exert an oppose force to counter that which the warped space have induce on the object ( gravity ) . all that have change when the object be release be it can accelerate freely and we can observe the resulting notion . i see what you be get at - the question could be rephrase as how be an object in a region of warped space constantly under an acceleration towards the centre of the gravitional field , the strength of which depend upon the size of the body and the distance separate the two ?	0
nope . big foot , dragon , unicorn , mermaid , there be scientific factor that make their existence unlikely to live in the current environment . such as size , evolution , and nature ufo , god , fairy , magic , theres no scientific study that disprove nor support them . so i guess yes , its 50 / 50 theres no scientific study that disprove nor support them . so i guess yes , its 50 / 50 so more or less half of these be likely to exist right ? every imaginary thing that i could make up , half of that be probable to exist if they all can not be proven or disproven ?	0

what i would like to see be a rather antiquated method of community . have all the destroy housing area raze and bulldoze to level , bare soil , then have massive ' barn - raise ' house building , where the people ( in that area ) pitch in to rebuild each others house ( and build theirs ) . it ' s somewhat like habitat for humanity too , with the difference be all neighbor pitch in . sh . . . do not tell anyone : habitat for humanity be a religious ( gasp ) organization . those mean old hateful christians - - help give home to needy people . . .	1

so , you think there be a god ? bad design do not equate to no design . it really be a poor argument . much of the force of darwin ' s argument deal with bad design . i invite anyone to post any of darwin ' s argument that specifically outline his case against design because of `` bad `` design . that say , consider this , your car be say to operate at 25 % fuel efficiency . one could claim then the car be 75 % bad design , therefore it be not design , and if it be , certainly not by anyone of any intelligence . your audio cd ' s have reed - solomon error correction because the read / write process be full of error that need correct . cleary this be `` bad design `` that engineer would create read / write head that make so many error in the first place . same with modem and host of other device . clearly if in the remote chance these bad design be evidence of design , the designer must be clueless ! poorly design drama have villain and hero . clearly a drama ( even a divine drama ) be poorly design if it have villain in the story . all the character should be pollyanna and there should be no great tragedy on the road to a happy end . life and the divine drama , like cd ' s and car , be clearly not design , or at least not design by anyone with intelligence , because of all the bad design weave into the design . the reason audio cd ' s have so many read / write error which be correct reed - solomon error correction ( somewhat like us read someone ' s writing and mentally correct spell and grammar error ) be that it be the most optimal way to get as much data on a cd as possible . the tight packing of data implies the high amount of error base on the shannon capacity theorem . the mp3 ' s and jpegs be even more `` error `` prone in that they be inexact representation of the original sound or picture , but the goal be not fidelity but compactness . a similar consideration be for the 75 % inefficiency for car . the goal be for high acceleration and agility and cost , etc . , not fuel efficiency . the point be `` bad `` design , in the grand scheme of thing , might not be bad design after all . the high rate of sickness and death , the eventual death of the universe as predict by the 2 nd law of thermodynamics be not evidence that the designer be unwise , any more than the many error in the read / write process of audio cd suggest the engineer of those device be incompetent . origin of specie chapter 13 : there be another and equally curious branch of the present subject ; namely , the comparison not of the same part in different member of a class , but of the different part or organ in the same individual . most physiologist believe that the bone of the skull be homologous with that be correspond in number and in relative connexion with the elemental part of a certain number of vertebra . the anterior and posterior limb in each member of the vertebrate and articulate class be plainly homologous . we see the same law in compare the wonderfully complex jaw and leg in crustacean . it be familiar to almost every one , that in a flower the relative position of the sepal , petal , stamen , and pistil , as well as their intimate structure , be intelligible in the view that they consist of metamorphosed leaf , arrange in a spire . in monstrous plant , we often get direct evidence of the possibility of one organ be transform into another ; and we can actually see in embryonic crustacean and in many other animal , and in flower , that organ which when mature become extremely different , be at an early stage of growth exactly alike . how inexplicable be these fact on the ordinary view of creation ! why should the brain be enclose in a box compose of such numerous and such extraordinarily shape piece of bone ? as owen have remark , the benefit derive from the yielding of the separate piece in the act of parturition of mammal , will by no mean explain the same construction in the skull of bird . why should similar bone have be create in the formation of the wing and leg of a bat , use as they be for such totally different purpose ? why should one crustacean , which have an extremely complex mouth form of many part , consequently always have few leg ; or conversely , those with many leg have simpler mouth ? why should the sepal , petal , stamen , and pistil in any individual flower , though fit for such widely different purpose , be all construct on the same pattern ? on the theory of natural selection , we can satisfactorily answer these question . homology be a pre - darwinian idea with the term coin by owen who rather despise darwin and his idea . darwin try to argue why a designer would not use the same for the same function . he say homology be evidence of an unwise design . the premise be a creator would not be so inefficient . but , unless one have a handle on the teleological goal , one be free to fabricate all manner of `` bad design `` argument ( for example read / write error in audio cd ' s or fuel inefficient car ) . the biotic message theory suggest the teleological goal for biotic reality be to communicate to human that there be one designer and author of life , and that life could not have evolve . like a great novel , the `` imperfection `` of biology be part of a large plot . it be turn out , darwin ' s argument from homology be a concept in crisis . you be assume that the toe of evolution have remain static since darwin time . i have to say that be false . we have 150 year of experimental data beyond that . in addition , we not only have the arguement from homology , but we have genetic data to back it up . so sorry , but you strike out .	0
one other point : say that the law of physic ( which be derive from mutual human experience ) be wrong but just appear to be right and that some omnipotent be can change them whenever he like . if these apparent law have remain the same for all of record human time , then why should we suspect that they may change at any moment ? it all come down to probability - if thing be not what we expect they be from science , then that should have manifest itself by now . i be not claim any omnipotent deciever . i be not sure where you derive ' probability ' from , or how you can have any degree of certainty over your past experience or those of other consciousness . and in any case , say ' it have not happen yet ' be hardly logical proof .	0
read the article , it tell you who find the quote ( site intelligence group ) . in any case , my point be would it matter ? these group be as likely to be pull reverse psychology ( at least in public statement ) as anything else , i be point out the absurdity of use such endorsement to score political point . btw if you want to attack the source , you ' d be far well point out that the poster , while post on an extremist website , be not actually an al qaeda member or representative of any kind . rather than actually do some research , you just put your finger in your ear and claim the source do not exist . b , if it ' s password protect , then how would they access it ? then i suppose america would look lovely as the crater in the death star ! you be tell me to believe that it exist even though there be no evidence that it do ? once again : there ' s a witness in this courtroom who say that i do not kill that guy , but i be the only one who can see him and hear him . in other word , unless the page be show to me , i have no reason to believe that it exist .	1
well , this come from the same people who invent the death pannels . the truth be that all the developed country ( all of europe , canada , japan , australia , new zealand , taiwan , israel ) have universal healthcare . their cost per caput be about half of ours . they have good outcome . universal healthcare have be try in many place and it do work . what do not work be our current system . wellpoint have just increase premium by 30 % even wiyhout a reform bill . they spend 30 % on administrative cost . btw , do you oppose the bill that would force them to limit the administrative cost to 20 % ? now name one country with universal socialize healthcare with a population of 300 million citizen modulus , just one if you can . your exemplar country be tiny in comparison to us so let get realistic and compare apple to apple for once , ok ?	1
or maybe we have a mental disability ? yes , it be not common to show anger when you be happy . however , just because the majority of people share something in common do not always mean the truth ? i always wonder if the majority be wrong ? what i mean be : what if the people in the mental hospital be mentally normal and those who be classifed as normal be not normal ? you can choose a sonnet and correctly pick ' s its emotion but you can never be so sure . that be my problem . how do you know for sure if the emotion you choose be correct ? please give an example of this sonnet ? lol we be so off topic . i do not want to spam her debate . let continue this debate in the messaging system please . however , just because the majority of people share something in common do not always mean the truth ? very good . philosopher call this type of argument ' argumentum ad populum ' . it be a fallacy that many people be prone to commit . you can choose a sonnet and correctly pick ' s its emotion but you can never be so sure i agree . shakespearean scholar often disagree about very miniscule detail . but i think just because they be not ' sure ' , that do not mean that they can not be certain . maybe you could go google ' shakespeare sonnet 1 ' and read just the first poem of his sonnet collection . tell me what you think ! i be sure that shakespeare will charm you like he have charm so many .	0
most people with `` divine experience `` be schizophrenic . the rest be look to get attention . people be fallible , hard physical evidence be not . once some of that turn up , i will start to keep an open mind to your side of the story . so , be i look for attention or be i mentally ill ?	1
well , it may be evil even though it doesn ` t signal the end time . i mean , if we where all to have the same currency there would be some really daunting economic implication when we experience local or regional demand or suply shock for example . that ' s certainly an interesting point . i know next to nothing about global economics , so i will not try to argue here . but i will make a guess that such a thing will never happen as long as we be still a superpower and cling to our beloved dollar . probably we will devolve into just four or five major currency in the next 50 or so year and leave it at that for a long while . but to stay on topic , i be just wonder why such a thing be bring up as a sign of the end . why would it seem evil to someone live back then ? it ' s an oft - quote religious statistic that always leave me scratch my head .	0
i ' d love to hear how some of these anti - theist would explain how to square wipe out all evil ( decision with negative consequence ) while leave people freedom of choice . you do not want to be mindless robot , eh ? ' course not . but do not blame god for all the evil in the world when you know one ( evil ) can not exist without the other ( freedom ) . so god would rather have evil in the world than infringe freedom . how very libertarian of you , jyoshu . but actually , be evil and freedom inversely proportionate ? look at the example i give : slavery be both evil and an infringement on human freedom . on top of that , god put evil into people and then do not take responsibility when these people do evil thing . not to mention the evil that he himself have do . murder , genocide , bigotry . the lot . if he make people with complete freedom , he must have make people with evil as well . why do he do that ? the only reason i can come up with be that if god make everyone in his image , he himself must be evil , even partially . that that be apparent in the bible .	0
michael jackson be a sing / dance enigma that have not be equal in the history of the us . sammy davis come close . elvis be big on marketing and short on pure talent . neither of the aforementioned be my `` cup o ' tea `` so to speak but i must give credit where credit be due regardless . one other thing whacko jacko represent be the sheer possibility afford to each and every american citizen to succeed . michael jackson come into this world a poor , black , male and look at him now ! a rich , white , woman ! it be rumor that he arrive in court to hear the verdict wear a pair of boy underwear tie around his right arm . the judge ask him if he be be contemptuous to the courtroom and jackson reply , `` oh no , your honor . i be on the patch . `` tong tong tong good one , truthsayer emoticonxgood . a rich white woman . lol ! get ta be from texas . tong 	1

then go away . if you have no interest , then why on earth be you even here to debate ? besides this , you be try to put kill human being on the same platform as animal or organic plant life . i ' d seriously suggest you reconsider your view on what exactly be more important . you can not put those thing together , they mix about as well as oil and water . if the court or parental unit be not allow to interfere with abortion plan , do the mother have the right to kill the child ? who be she to interfere with her child ' s life if her own parent can not make her live with a baby she can just give up for adoption ? by the way , only 1 % of abortion be make because of rape . if it be my decision , i would outlaw abortion altogether for the other 99 % who have abortion irresponsibly and save over a million life . do not get me wrong , i do feel for victim of such crime , but a few thousand hardly outweigh over a million . and they do not even have to die ! they just have to live with a baby for a few month , and they can get on with their life ! it ' s more of a chance than the baby will get otherwise . so , in your scenario , prototype , be you anti - choice folk go to force us who believe in choice , who believe that a woman own her very own body , be you go to place us in re - education jail so that we , too , believe that a fertilized egg be a human be ?	1

only until the gop get its act together or a true conservative party can replace it . the idea be that conservatism work every time it be properly implement . you have to remember that whenever liberal have a long term stranglehold ( re . new york state ) , there be no prosperity , only misery and an expansive ( and expensive ) welfare state . i guess the european union be a great failure ? be that why the euro be trend 1.5 dollar as liberalism creats misery ?	1

the problem , however , become more manageable once you realize that all you need be a computer with a database that show where all the food / water hoarder live . no such database exists , to the best of my knowledge ; certainly not one we could gain access to . and in any event , post - apocalypse technology will be limit to thing that operate without electricity , for the most part , so maintaining and power a computer after the end of the world would be pretty much impossible . i think you need to take your plan back to the draw board , as it all hinge on this one ill conceive idea . also , even if your computer idea work and be a reality , you just tell a whole bunch of people about it , so now you have unwanted competition . hmm . , unwanted competition . , i guess you be all on that database then wink 	0
personally i do not give rat rear end about your god - neither he , you , the government or the ignoramous in rome will ever have say in what happen to this body . yes there be - and as long as you continue to trivialize and disregard them you will not to a damned thing to reduce abortion . have you ever consider the possibility that he care about you ? that he know you ? and that he care about those in the womb ? this be always the charge hurl at me but it be never found . you can not find any misogyny in my writing but rather a great respect for woman and their value and dignity . this be why i argue so strongly against abortion . yet , any oppression , or insecurity , or hardship , or difficulty they face , though real and challenging , be not justify in the face of destroy the life in the womb . though abortion reign freely and forcefully and abundantly still the oppression and abuse of woman endure . one reason they endure be that people be look in the wrong place for a solution - - they be look to abortion when it offer no solution .	0
sadam be horrible , and so be arafat . but arafat be not a bad leader than sharon . arafat be not a bad leader than sharon . arafat steal million in aid money that be suppose to go to the palestinian , which 80 % of them be below the poverty line . arafat advocate people to x themselves up so that they may kill as many jew as possible . he be the head - figure of many of these terrorist group and pours million of aid into them . sharon be bad ? not only have arafat contribute to many more than 1,000 israeli casualty , his ' intifada ' have continue the cycle of violence and thus cause the death of more than 2,000 palestinian .	0
if information come into be by chance , how can we know that anything be true ? how do you know what be false and what be `` true `` ? if we be just product of chance , your brain be also a product of chance . therefore , the thought patter that determine your logic be also product of chance . if your logic be the result of chance process , you can not even be sure it evolve properly . you can not even be sure you can reason properly ( use your definition ) because you can not trust your own logic . sound like the same skeptic argument above . i do not know about you nu leader , but when i be certain my mind exists . be you not certain ? you be actually require to be , to deny you exist would require existence , and that would be logically contradictory .	0
i disagree . well maybe technically . let us look at it this way . criminal ' access to gun may even go slightly up , because there be some criminal who may not want to obtain a handgun illegally . but the access of innocent citizen will go up way more than yes , but i think you miss my point . i state this above , remember the prohabition ? people actually drank more alchohal . without a ban , law abide citizen and criminal will have them , with a ban , there will be just criminal .	0

i would not say one can not be a christian if they support abortion but i find it really hard to understand how one justify or rectify it with the bible or their faith . ultimately their be responsible to god for what they believe and how they advise others on what to do in a situation base on that belief . i know that one of the thing god hate and there be not many thing mention in the bible that he hat , one of the thing be the shedding of innocent blood . if god hat such a thing then i certainly do not want to support it . i do not know what could be more innocent than an unborn child . i do a bit of research on abortion & the bible a few year ago , here be a collection of what i find - abortion & the bible can we get away from quote 5 year old post ? seriously , if you do not take the time to actually read the thread why should i respond to your post ?	0
the terrorist saw it as absolutly necessary . personally , i disagree . when we kill child in iraq , we see it as absolutly necessary , call it a horrible side effect of war . i disagree on that , too , i do not think it be necessary at all . this seem to conflict with some of your early post wherein you support terrorist .	0
fortunately , the bolshevik revolution fail . 1989 , the berlin wall come a - tumble down , along with soviet ideology . communism be a failed philosophy and the free world have soundly reject it . of course the bolshevik revolution be doom from the start as russia be not indsutrialised and the revolution be impose by a minority of the bourgeoisie rather than a mass movement of the proletariat ( not that there be a proletariat in russia at the time ) .	0

and what type of objectivist view do you have toward gay issue if i may ask ? i be assume gay issue may seem irrelevant since they probably do not pertain to you well , cause your not gay . there be no objective reason to condemn gay . marriage be not a matter of state and so it be meaningless to argue whether a state should recognize it . my advocating of perfect liberty allow no contradiction or exception , believe me i have lose alot of support from conservative for this , perhaps even gays if one really apply it to all extreme .	0
and in any case , say ' it have not happen yet ' be hardly logical proof . it have not happen yet be not absolute proof , just that it make the probability of it be wrong quite small . by the way , if you be in the least bit intellectually honest , i challenge you to actually act on any of those doubt about the reality of existence and any other reality that we understand from all human experience . otherwise , if you never act on those doubt , you be simply be hypocritical .	0
you flame liberal be really something else . at least we be generous with our own money . you radicals help the poor use other people ' s money . then you keep them on your government plantation so they can vote to keep you in power . sieg heil ! you kind of make a good point here . both the government and the church have ulterrior motif for ' help the poor ' : the politician hope to gain vote and the church hop to gain convert . both group of sucker will be pay back for the rest of their life in one way or another . and the church collect more of ' it ' s own money ' to purchase more poor sinner . both group be indentured servant to their master . what do you mean ' generous with your own money ' ? be not that what the government be ? perhaps the christian do not want to help all the poor - only those who belong to their church or those willing to sell their soul to it . both be do a terrible job of ' help the poor ' .	1
well , late word be that the alphabet soup be take the threat seriously . that be strange the last i read bin laden absolutely hat the regime in iran , mainly becasue iran be run by the shia and bin laden be a sunni . so iran should be hold accountable for action of bin laden ? it seem like before ( iraq ) people be try to conjure up link between the real terrorist threat ( aq ) and unrelated nation .	0

emoticonxrolleyesno . i be not say that . like i have be say from the beginning , the right have be use tea party and attempt to do two thing off them . 1 ) exaggerate their number to make themselves seem big . freedomworks lie about cbs report `` 2 million `` . even fox news put the attendance in five digit , yet fw try to pretend they be much large . 2 ) pretend a uniformity of presence behind a rational banner , when the truth be that a large segment of attendance sits behind a looney banner ( like call the president racist or kenyan or secret muslim or fascist / socialist / communist / nazi ) . that be my point . or an even more popular one ? the strawman argument ! damn , take some real gonad ( wait , you be a lib , so scratch that one ) to claim the power to get inside the mind and heart of the mass . a protest by conservative must be racist , but a protest by libs be pure and righteous , correct ?	1
and you never know when a word of god will touch you , because the word itself be spiritual . for the word of god be live and active . sharp than any double - edge sword , it penetrate even to divide soul and spirit , joint and marrow ; it judge the thought and attitude of the heart . - hebrews 4:12 the word touch me in a bad place . i think it be at summer camp or something . i be still scar . no but seriously even i do not believe that . how exactly be word spiritual ? be it intentional ? base upon the interpretation an individual get from it ? see as how the history of the bible itself and it ' s original writing , many interpretation , denomination , and debate over itself be construe it can hardly be see as itself be spiritual . be it possible that through god the manuscript and texts stir inside a person a level of spirituality ? yes . but when you go buy a bible at barnes and noble it certainly be not glow with the essence of god . it ' s debate if even the ark of the covenant itself if it still exist have the essence of god to this day . 	0

let me try to translate into words1 . if there be a god in this world , there be a god in all worlds2 . there be a god be a possibility3 . if there ' s a god in all world , there ' s a god in this one4 . there not be a god in all world implies that there ' s be not a god in any world ( all or nothing ) 5 . there be either a god in all world or there be not a god in all worlds6 . from 4,5 there either be a god in all world or no god in any world7 . if there ' s no god in this world then there ' s not a god in all worlds8 . there ' s either a god in all world or there be no god in any world . 9 . since god be a possibility we know the statement there be no god in any world be false . 10 . since there ' s a god in all world there ' s a god in this one from 3 be this the right interpretation ? if it be there be one flaw in it . 9 be flaw . just because there ' s a possibility of a god do not mean that there be a god in some world , just that there ' s a possibility of him be in some world . i be impressed ! this be a very precise description , in regular englishand yes , the deduction in 9 seem presumptious if all we state be god have a `` possibility of existence `` . how this be cleverly clear up ( from the same source site ) be simply a trip back to the definition : `` great possible be `` . the `` great possible be `` , by definition , must have a possible existence . in otherwords , we can not assume that there be a possibility that the great possible be do not exist . yeah , it sound like the whole `` proof `` be pointless because your premise be already the proofjust keep in mind that for the purpose of this proof , god be define as `` the great be possible `` . as long as that definition be maintain , the proof work . do that mean that god exist ? hmm . emoticonxfrazzled	0

i personally be astound at the overreaction of the government in response to a handfull of shooting in no . send in the army in full force , confiscate gun and talk about an ' insurgency ' just because of a couple of crackpot have be fire their gun . on an average day in new york there be 10 time as many report of shooting , yet i do not see such a massive military response over there . well , if they have re - establish control in new orleans ( and it seem they have ) , then take a gun away from someone carry it on the street would be what the police normally do in any city . if they be take it away from people ' home , and not let them keep them , that would be over and above what they normally do . ( i be very pro - 2 nd amendment , so do not get me wrong here . i be just point out that take gun away from people happens in every city every day ) i also think that it ' s kind of disingenuous to complain about the military coming in - - just a week ago everyone be criticize the govt . for not send in the military . now people be criticize them for do it ? 	0
a ' pro - life ' murderer strike again . be not these extremist nut case wonderful ? i hope this sicko do not get the death penalty . that would not be ' pro - life .

gun sale be boom nationwide — and in erie county , application for pistol permit be roll in at nearly three time last year ' s rate , the county clerk ' s office report . meanwhile , in the nation ' s capital , gun control have become , in essence , dead on arrival . chalk it all up to the election of a democratic president with a long record of support gun restriction and a congress that include a surprising number of pro - gun democrat from rural area . the election of barack obama as president be spark a run on firearm and ammunition in both buffalo and nationwide , accord to gun dealer and expert on the issue . unfortunately democrat have a credibility problem . many pro - gun democrat have be elect , and america be give them a chance , but apparently they do not believe obama because of his past anti - gun support and vote . however m . feinstein ' s comment about wait for the correct timing to bring up gun control do not help the creditability problem either . i guess only time will tell .	0

can anyone make a rational argument as to why execute a criminal who be 18 year old when commit the crime be not `` cruel and unusual punishment , `` but execute a criminal who be less than 18 at the time of the crime would be cruel and unusual ? put another way , can anyone explain why it be constitutional to execute a person who be 18 year old when they commit the crime , but it be unconstitutional to execute a person who be under 18 when they commit the crime ? participant in this discussion should assume that the death penalty , in general , be constitutional . this have be the case from the beginning of our republic , and have be reaffirm multiple time . in other word , it be not an appropriate argument to try and argue that the death penalty , in general , be unconstitutional . that have neither be the case through our history , and be not the current state of the law . * note : i be speak within the context of the united state , and its constitution . i think that we have get to draw a line at some point , to demarcate between adult and child . where ever we do draw it , it will seem , in some situation to be arbitrary . if we make it 20 , the question would be why 20 year old and not 19 . through the year society have determine that by 18 people should have attain enough life experience to form intent and to comprehend that their action have consequence ( at least as it apply to the death penalty , they can be try as adult w / o death ) . we do not execute people who can not comprehend the nature of their crime and society say that , under 18 you can not fully comprehend criminal action .	0

as i have mention many time in these forum , one ' s personal view of abortion ( i . e . , whether it should be prohibit or permit ) have nothing whatsoever to do with whether roe v . wade should be overturn . if one support the rule of law , then they would have to support the statement make by senator mccain . also , give that you do not like his stated position on gay marriage ( i . e . , that marriage be a state issue ) , it appear to me that you do not like democracy either . ah , so i do not like democracy , and yet it be you who in the post be tell me that i have to support mccain ' s statement . be you serious ? that sure do not sound like democracy to me . i also find it funny that you claim that i do not like democracy when my very post state that i would be vote for the democrat party . but then , i guess if we do not support bushyboy and his fellow republicanazis , we must be against democracy , right ? get real , phyllis .	1

any two adult can run the household , one can make the decision if the other be incapacitate , one inherits when the other dy , etc etc . that parallel do not carry over to group marriage . when one dy , who inherit ? if one be incapacitied , who decide what the treatment should be ? basically , pretty much none of the marriage benefit law that be on the book make any sense for group of more than two , so recongnising group marriage be a huge legal task , and one for which the outcome be far from obvious . if we be talk about legal recognition , and we be ( right ? ) , then the case be wildly different . our marriage law , for good or bad , be set up on the assumption of two adult run a household . they also assume man and wife , true , but do not actually depend on that . but the dependence on there be two people be embed in the law ; change that be a huge project . yes , but gay would also want law change to accomodate their form of marriage as well . the fact that one require less change than the other should not matter , should it ? should have to do more reworking of law and more paperwork hinder the pursuit of equality ? it seem to me your argument boil down to `` polygamy require more work to make the law accomodate it . `` yeah - - such be the price for marriage equality . let us face it - - if society really want to make marriage an open - ended institution of equality rather than for opposite - sex couple which comprise most relationship , they could pull it off - - polygamy , gay , let 17 year old marry , etc . all those civil servant be there and can do it as direct as legislation be change . mean could be set up to determine inheritance , for example . law can be word to do it .	0

so do this mean they have to get tough on gun control or soft before the result go their way ? that be the real question . my guess be that we be catch in the unhappy medium where go in either direction will be more successful than where we be now . so then will you go the way on liberty ( repeal stoopid law ) or tyranny ( enact more unconstitutional law ) ?	1
if the law of logic be human construct then how can they be absolute since human think differently and often contradictorily . if they be produce from human mind , and human mind be mutually contradictory , then how can the construct be absolute ? therefore , the law of logic be not human construct . very true . logic exist whether people be there to grasp its concept or not . where we disagree be at your assumption that god create logic . how can this be ? logic be not contingent on any intelligent entity , whether it be man or god , to exist . the logic of increase a quantity by add to it would remain whether god exist or not . you have yet to tie the existence of logic to god as its cause	0

actually if it have say ' . but have not love ' , it would mean that . but it do not say that , it say if i be charitable but not love for it , then help others be pointless . you be joke right ? that ' s not even close . here ' s the verse just in case you read something else , i will give you the benefit of the doubt with that : 1 corinthian 13 happy : if i give away all i have , and if i deliver up my body to be burn , but have not love , i gain nothing . this do not mean ' but not love for it ' , but show love .	0
you should also note that the one scenario i think the death penalty be acceptable for be if they try to escape use violence or if they attack another prisoner . this have show that they be willing to commit act of violence and frankly have nothing to so the initial murder wasn ' t enough to show `` that they be willing to commit act of violence `` ? this make absolutely no sense .	0

keep in mind two important point : 1 . reason do not imply truth , it ' s a method of seperating truth from what be false , and you can quite easily ( and do every day ) , reason something to a false conclusion . 2 . you can believe whatever you like , and it can certainly impact your life ( faith ) , however it can not be say that faith be base on rational belief , or take part in reason , in any way , it be the opposite of reason . if information come into be by chance , how can we know that anything be true ? how do you know what be false and what be `` true `` ? if we be just product of chance , your brain be also a product of chance . therefore , the thought patter that determine your logic be also product of chance . if your logic be the result of chance process , you can not even be sure it evolve properly . you can not even be sure you can reason properly ( use your definition ) because you can not trust your own logic . as for the second part , no , you have get it backward , rational belief be base on faith in a rational creator . reference kiss the creationist basis for modern science . * the lie : evolution ~ ken ham . * evolution : fact or fiction ? ~ john blanchard .	0

 3 - can anyone explain to me why no other ape , monkey or chimp have evolve into a high specie ? what be a ' high ' specie . if you mean a more intelligent primate ? the concept there be a hierarchy of ' high ' and ' low ' specie be incorrect . theonly difference between man and the other primate be that man have a hyperdeveloped brain . there be two sugar that be naturally produce by body by most mammal . when investingating the presnece of these chemical , one of them be present in much low concentration in the brainsof all mammal . however , human have a mutation that interrupt the production of this chemical . a piece of random junk get insert into the middle of the gene that produce this chemical , and disable it . sometimes , evolution be not so much about what be add , but what be remove .	0
say repeal would have to be sign by the president , right ? i trust you have not forgoten who currently hold that position , or how likely his signature would be ? you may have miss the context from the other thread i refer to . the point i make be that the unlikeliness of a presidential signature do not stop senator obama from vote in favor of a required iraq troop withdraw timetable . the promised veto threat do not matter in this instance . he be `` stand on principle . `` well , same would apply for his newfound view disfavor doma as well in my view .	0

precisely , if a master craftsman destroy his fine creation because it be flaw , be he do something wrong ? or be not it his right to do what he wish with his creation . so it be with the maker of all that be . so they may seem like terrible act from your very limited perspective , but from the perspective of a perfect and holy god , his judgement be a righteous one on all level . but why would one expect you to get that ? so then how do you know that abortion be not in the plan then ? if as you say we have `` very limited perspective ``	1
actually its not sicken in any way . these kid be at risk and need to know the resource available to them to avoid realize those risk . frankly i thinik its a good idea to trot them around to agency and organization which they may need to interact with in the future . knowledge can keep them out of deep trouble . ignorance will not do so . so you think it be a good idea for public school to assume the role of parent ? perhaps you would support a balance then . give what you say here , you would not think it a bad idea for the new hampshire school system to take a field trip to the local catholic church would you ? you know , so kid can know what resource , agency , and organization be available to them in the event that they may need to interact with them in the future . the school board apparently get the message , however . accord to the article , it have instruct school administrator to investigate the matter , and determine whether disciplinary action be necessary . i would think it be .	1

so let see how many other people be be target by the inquisition for their faith by the big three . let us see there be naturally me . jp by archie . and now esdraelon ( godzilla monster ? ) question romebigred . so your say that his belief do not hold sway with what the mormon teach ? or be it just that when he give you evidence that counter your ignorance on his religion , your perceived opinion of mormonism be thus null and void ? thanks for that , jason . in esdraelon ' s defense , there be hundred of author of other religion who choose to take portion of our writ out of context , and morph them into something that look like what he describe . ( a self - make god who have an alotted portion of the universe . ) this be not the actual belief of lds . this be a skewed and exaggerated oversimplification of our doctrine of eternal progression . it ' s also what seem to be most commonly understood when an lds try to briefly explain the doctrine . in other word , i be not surprised that esdraelon be under that impression .	0
if there be many people read this that already believe in evolution , or for that matter , believe in biblical creationism , then it be important to keep in mind that the people appeal to science have bias at work , regardless of how objectively rationalistic they present themselves . well , i do not believe in evolution . i believe in thing for which i have no evidence . and while it be true that everyone have bias , use correct science and the process of peer review work to eliminate . not all be perfect , and people be people , but overall the system work . not a lot of bad science get through . in the case of `` creation science `` we know that there be no science involve . only talk that sound scientific . there be no hypothesis , prediction or testing . only ad hoc story construct of select bit of evidence to support the foregone conclusion .	0

because satan be a fallen angel . he have a chance to be with god , but he do not take it . he could go back to god any time he want to , but he do not want to . he have free will . god will not take that away , even though he can . i do not agree with this debate . if prevent the devil from interfere on earth should not be prevent by god then why be it that god do prevent the devil from interfere in heaven after he be defeat ? they be both essentially take the devil away from an area where he could potentially harm those that be good . god seemingly saw fit for one to occur but not the other . why would that be ?	0
the fetus be non - sentient , so it have no ' desire ' . the fetus be totally dependent on a woman ' s body , and have no existence without the woman ' s body . this be not the case with a dog . this be not the case with the woman . she be a sentient person , and not a container . she undergo physical change and physical risk by be pregnant . she risk , and she sacrifice , use her own body . it be selfish of a man to think he can control her body and her life . it will never have the same kind of impact on his health and on his life , that it will have on hers . not even close . apparently you need to read up on up - to - date case of fetus viability and premature birth success statistic . that ' s right , and she do it after the baby be bear by care for it as well . so ? i guess you ' d also be in favor of it be legal for a mother to not allow her baby to live because she have to care for it after it ' s born too , with that reason . there be many , many woman in the pro - life movement . my wife be one of them and she be a lot more passionate about it than i be . ( trust me , you do not want to be in a room with her after you have kill a baby ! ) if you think this be a men versus woman issue , you be sadly mistake .	1
arnie be no conservative at all . and nuttyfornia ' s legislature be democrat . and new york ' s assembly have be run by democrat since at least the 1 9 5 0 s . why be it that people do not want to admit that it be bush ' s ' reckless spending on a war that we do not need , the tax cut for the rich 2 % of america , the fact that under bush they have to add space on the debt clock , not to mention that he be as dumb as a rock , yet they can place all this blame on obama who inherit this mess and have do more to get us out of it than bush or any republican would have do . unemployment be high , we know this , but it be on it ' s way up when obama take over because under bush more corporation leave this country , more business close down , the bank be allow to do whatever they want without regulation of any kind , and yet none of it be his fault ? . enlighten me . 	1

ironically , when i have publicaly advance the idea that god be generally compatable with evolution , i find that my agnostic and atheistic colleague be generally comfortable with such idea , but many believer be dumbfound . i believe that ' s true , and as a `` believer `` ( creationist ) , here be what be hard to understand about that ; in matthew , 12:30 , jesus say `` he who be not with me be against me , and he who do not gather with me scatter `` . it be safe to say that both creationists and theistic evolutionist would accept that statement from jesus , and would seek to be `` with `` him , while agnostic and atheist would consider themselves `` not with `` him . yet theistic evolutionist be comfortable to ( usually politically ) be `` with `` agnostic and atheist , and separate themselves from creationists . if they be genuine christian , know about the warning in the bible about false teaching , how can they be comfortable with that ? miller lament in several place throughout the book that atheists use evolution as a weapon against religion , and that it should not be that way - that it cause more strife between the two than should exist .	0
the idea of abortion as population control be absurd , especially forced abortion as someone mention a few post ago . anyone who have read a biology book know the world have method of population control on its own , we do not need to be do stuff like that ourselves . this stat sound more than a bit inflated . see as it come from a website call `` woman ' s issue `` it be probably not all that credible . you question others source and credibility yet you parade around under the name of a giant cartoon shake ?	1

no , to rag on a gay activist - - because of the hypocrisy . and there be certainly people here who also can not pass up the opportunity to show such hypocrisy with religious activist against gay , and i do not recall you oppose them on that . if you all be go to take glee in hypocrisy of religious activist against gay right , you might as well realize that what ' s good for the goose be good for the gander . so what be you claim now ? that all this time that rosie be make fun of the chinese , she ' s actually be chinese all the while ? because that ' s the only legitimate way you could draw a parallel with those people who be hypocritically attack gay while be gay themselves .	1
if when i be in the military , i have suddenly stand up and say , `` woah ! hey ! i join the military but it be against my religious belief to hurt others , and this plan of action will hurt other people . `` should that be respect and i keep my `` job `` ? but the military be pretty much all a volunteer thing . it ' s not a hiring process - - employer / employee thing . that arrangement lend itself more to the soldier not volunteer for service in the first place .	0
its not the government job to censor information . for kid be subject to thing on the internet shouldnt be the government right to have them see certain thing and not see others . thats what parent be for . i love how the government have become the scapegoat for the failure of parent to control their kid , and in turn we be lose more and more civil liberty . 	1
i can not prove 100 % that god exist , the atheist can not prove100 % that god do not exist because absolute proof be not posible . if you can not prove or deal in absolute , then the basis of your argument , the `` absolute `` nature of logic , just become pretty shaky .	1
i think its finally settle that physical ( testable or tangible ) evidence of god can never be find . this be not only because of its elusive nature to science , but also because of religious requirement . from a scientic perspective , nothing ever occur outside of the realm of phyical law . that ' s not quite right . more accurate would be : nothing that occur outside the realm of physical law be in the realm of science . science by no mean preclude the possibility of there be something outside the realm of science .	0

what i have the gut to do be to submit to god perfect understanding and not hold the eternal god of time and space to the limited perspective which we have as finite being . to claim superior knowledge to a perfect , holy and eternal god be the epitome of `` arrogance `` which you obviously be not lack . i be humble enough and introspective enough to look at my own past , recognize my own human frailty , nature and shortcoming and humble myself before his perfect wisdom and knowledge to see clearly that which be not clear to me at the time . also , just to clarify , god have not tell me or anyone else to kill anyone enmasse in 2000 year since the advent of the age of grace which jesus , our messiah usher in . er . . . how do you know that god have not tell anyone to kill enmasse ( in the last 2000 year ) ? do he run all his order by you ?	1
then we be seriously take over life in a ridiculous way . let nature take its course . i do not have an argument of why this should not happen . i think its interesting to learn about how you do and stuff , but if people can go around and choose their child ' s gender , the world be seriously screw up . i agree , it be we that it be ridicule that we have get so into control stuff that now we even have a way to control natural course , but i guess like i say before if it be to stop your child from suffer a sickness then i guess that be okay ( still bad ) but good than just be a complete control freak , or be selfish	0

what do you think be motivate these scientist to lie to us ? i think that ' s an excellent question . since my area of expertise be chemistry and not climatology , i can only speculate that it ' s a combination of peer pressure , the desire to get funding and their allow government to manipulate their finding . there have be several instance in which member of the ipcc have quit amidst claim that the final report issue do not reflect their research . since the final ipcc report be review by politician prior to be publish , i be not surprise with the claim make . here ' s a relevent story .	0

you behave as if i have to demonstrate that no ider have ever try to use ic to support id . i do not and i have make no claim that one could not .

' ( the two point be case where the video indicate that iders try to use ic to prove id ) all i say be that they can not . so i ask you again can one support id with ic ? youtube - fallacy of id and creationism - false dichotomy [ reload ] ridiculous . if ic can not support id , id have absolutely nothing go for it , right ? include their supporter of ic , since all of them with the exception of you use it to support id . behe be wrong , dembski be wrong , johnson be wrong , every id supporter be wrong for use ic , because freedom the great think it ' s wrong . daewoo : ic be irreducible complexity , the idea that complex biological system like the eye or bacterial flagellum could not have evolve through a gradual process , but have to have be form all at once , by a designer with a function in mind . id be intelligent design , creationism with new pseudo - scientific skin , a political ploy for creationism to gain scientific respect . it fail . michael behe be an advocate of id who come up with ic .	0

1 . be you refer to `` christian `` creationism ? intelligent design ? if so , then it ' s nothing more than a christio - centric argument . there ' s no difference between christian creationism / id and the wapuri warrior ideal creation myth which focus on the divine parrot . if you be focus on christian creationism v evolution , there be more than one system of creation , and it do not necessarily revolve around one omnipotent , omniscient be . it could be an accident as well ! what one thing be an obvious fact from history ? you be talk about western civilization . western civilization ' s religious belief be not the be - all , end all , of creation . there ' s as reason to believe in spontaneous generation as there be in christian creationism . you can also use any eastern or south american or native american belief system of creation . creationism be not something new , it be the prevailing view of scientist up until darwin . none of them belived in a divine parrot that be just plain silly . in the crucible of natural science throughout the middle age , the scientific revolution and well into the 1 9 th century theology be the queen of the science . now we subject student to high math study that they will most likely never use and speculation about conceptual mechanism like natural selection that have no practical application . naturalistic presumption have become sacrosanct in the rhetoric of the professional scientist who have be crystal clear on how they define creationism . you can ignore the statement by d.j . futuyma and identical one make by gould , mayr , dawkins , dobzhansky and others but not without depart from mainstream evolutionary biology .	0

well , i be not an atheist , but i definitely do not believe in the bible . however , i do not think the `` atheists `` or the non - christian believer promote morality . our issue be only base in the fact that we be a normal part of society and would very much like to have that respect . on the other side , the fundies say they know what ' s right for everyone and look at us as reprobrates , condemn . blah blah blah . do not think we be promote morality . we be not pedophile , thief or evil people . but we be constantly condemn by the moral christianists . i think our side of the moral issue be more of a knee - jerk reaction to the jerk on the fundie side . if someone kick you constantly , would not you eventually kick back . the problem with the fundies be that when we kick back , it hurt . but they feel justify in what they do . it ' s probably defensive to some extent on both side . a lot of atheist i have run into seem to be out to prostlytize as well - - they be basically evangelist for the atheist way of thinking . religiously atheist , you might say . they be look for opportunity to assert the atheist message . and i have read some pretty darn hateful thing say about christianity right here in these forum , and just chalk it up to be `` defend `` or `` kick back `` do not really fly . who know who throw the first punch ? it ' s to the point that it do not really matter anymore , because both side should be show respect .	0

a fairer comparison for science as a whole would be the inner way of thinking and knowing , as contrast to that base on external empiricism . i think that have far more staying power . but it take a lot long to develop . my point be that only after about 5000 year of human civilization do empiricism as science develop . religion , supernaturalism , and mythology trace back into prehistory . what we know as science do not even begin to exist until the late 1 5 0 0 s and 1 6 0 0 s . before that it be ok to do science like aristotle do - no experiment , only think about a logical answer . thus , heavy object fell faster than light one and any fool could tell that the sun orbit the earth . but science be more than an inner way of thinking . it be a process and a method for learn about the universe . it be call methodological naturalism . that be not to say the science assert that nothing exist except what be natural . it say that science can not study the supernatural .	0
good start . now the question become where do the stuff for the big bang come from ? you see , this could go on for a while , because the next logical question be ' where do that stuff come from ' and so on . no one could ask the same thing about a god . the god of the bible be supposedly self existent . one could say that about the universe , but give the big bang hypothesis , that do not fly . so now what ? huck oh yes we can . invoke god be not an explanation for ultimate origin , it ' s the papering over of the absence of an explanation by declare further application of the question off limit . simply declare that god ' s origin do not need explain do not make that so .	0
be not it amaze how quickly creationists will accept natural selection and superfast evolution when it support they be beliefs ? and it do not stop there . another of my favorite be how they loudly criticize radiometric dating ( most commonly radiocarbon date because they know no other kind ) then shout from the rooftop that radiometric date confirm the `` genuineness `` of ~ 2000 year old manuscript . 	0
i believe there be special dispensation for those who have never have a chance to hear the good news . the last pope mention something deal with this a few year ago iirc . this be also why the great commision for christian be evangelism . but you know what really do not make sense ? why be they evangelise to people ( who they know most of them will reject them ) if those people get a special dispensation ? they ' d be condemn people to hell by evangelize , would they not ? why not leave the people be and let them get the special dispensation ? emoticonxconfused	0

folk should be aware that every state in the united state except florida allows gay people to adopt as single parent . the issue come in many state when a same - sex spouse try to adopt as a second parent . some state permit this and some state do not . it ' s weird indeed that all state except one allow single gay people to adopt child , but many do not allow gay couple to be adoptive parent together . it make no sense to me , since two parent be usually good than one . do the sexual orientation of the would - be single parent even come up ?	0
`` there ' ll be cheer for our result on the pro - life side and denounce us angrily on the pro - choice side , neither of those position be sound . `` so accord to one of the people who conduct the study do not go use their result as a tool for argue against abortion . one woman i know have an abortion a short time after she be marry . i also know she have regret that she have the procedure . i consider what she have to say about her experience and thought about the 14 year old son she now have . from what she tell me , i could plainly see she would never have have her son if she have not have her abortion as her circumstance would have change beyond recognition . perhaps she get depress about the child she never have because of her abortion . however , her son be a fantastic boy whom she love very much . so we can not simplify in quite the way you seem to infer that we can .	0

do not expect the recent retraction and exoneration to change that . one of the strong , most - repeat finding in the psychology of belief be that once people have be tell x , especially if x be shock , if they be later tell , “ no , we be wrong about x , ” most people still believe x . as twain and churchill knew , sometimes the truth never catch up with the lie , let alone overtake it . as i write last summer in a story about why people believe lie even when they be later tell the truth , sometimes people ' s mental process simply go off the rail . absolutely true ! i discover that with my fluoride research . for whatever reason , most people take another ' s word for what the truth actually be instead of search for it themselves . if the lie be an easy pill to swallow than the truth pill , they will take the lie . emoticonxfrazzled	0

i do believe that the prediction be accurate , but i say ' no ' for two reason : one , stop the event would create a paradox . since the event be stop , it never happen . if it never happen , then nostradamus never predict it . the second reason be , in the prediction that correlate to 9 - 11 , skeptic ask why they could not stop the incendent . along with point one , i say to them ' how do you know that somebody do not go to authority on 9-10-01 , and say ' there ' s gon na be a terrorist attack tomorrow ' ' ? if someone cite a cryptic writing date back century as evidence , they would either be laugh at and dismiss , or send to a mental hospital . edit : sorry about forget the poll . i remember that just as i hit the submit button . i be half asleep today . . and half right . prevent something that have be predict do not create a paradox . your logic be severely flaw here . i be somewhat surprised by that . if i predict that georgia tech will win the peach bowl and lsu come up and prevents that , i still predict it . i be just wrong . you be attach something supernatural to nostradamus as if he really have some power to accurately predict the future . he make some lucky guess . that ' s all . sometimes , the local fortune cooky be right , too . sometimes the horoscope seem to fit . that do not mean that the writer ' s actually know anything about their future reader .	0

i do not think pro - choicers in general care whether or not abortion be truly rare . if they do they would put more effort into make sure it be rare , and not just legal . i know you be talk to jessica , so i will only comment on this . it would be easy to make it rare if pro - life people be not intent on make it illegal . pro - choice people have to make it as available as possible to counter pro - life attempt to shut it down entirely . if pro - life people do not exist , then the reasonable people could work towards make abortion rare . take the current debate for example . my entire point be that it should not be illegal . that abortion should be available as a safe and legal choice ( it can only be really safe if it ' s legal ) . we spend all our time and effort debate the legality that we spend no time on create program to help woman choose to continue their pregnancy instead of have an abortion , legal or not .	0

no . go read the bible before you look dumber than you already do . it sound like you be talk about something you know little about . god do not want us to be puppet . he want us to have free will , to do what we want - and if they do not want to love him , it should be their choice . if sin wasn ' t create , we would have be god ' s puppet . no . go read the bible before you look dumber than you already do . sorry dear , ad hominems do nothing . it sound like you be talk about something you know little about . i apologize i sound that way . i certainly know what i be refer to in the bible , and know that you have admit you do not necessarily follow the whole bible ( god bible ) i figure i would not assume you believe in genesis adam and eve . but rather give you the option to say yes or no . god do not want us to be puppet . i do not necessarily say puppet . he want us to have free will , to do what we want - and if they do love him , it should be their choice . if sin wasn ' t create , we would have be god ' s puppet . so god be perform some twisted reverse psychology on adam and eve ?	1
however , my point be that emotion alone can not build a case for theism or atheism . when such be the case , it be no different from a religion i think bring `` emotion `` into the question of whether god exists or not tends to cloud the issue a bit . be not the essence of atheism a rational enquiry which conclude that in the absence of any credible evidence , there be no reason to believe in god ? an emotional attachment to `` non - belief `` would be irrelevant ( and irrational ) .	0

how do atheist account for the law of logic in a universe without god ? the law of logic be conceptual by nature and absolute . be absolute they transcend space and time . they be not the property of the physical universe ( since they be conceptual ) or of people ( since people contradict each other , which would mean they be not absolute ) . so , how do they account for them ? example of logical absolute be : something can not be itself and not itself at the same time ( law of non contradiction ) . a thing be what it be ( law of identity ) . a statement be either true or false ( law of excluded middle ) . these be simple , absolute logical absolute . how can absolute , conceptual , abstract law be derive from a universe of matter , energy and motion ? in other word , how can an atheist with a naturalistic presupposition account for the existence of logical absolute when logical absolute be conceptual by nature and not physical , energy , or motion ? try the ( law of common sense ) . if your an ex - atheist , you already know the ( law of relativity ) .	1

one reptile have a type of third eye , but it be not for sight nor be it permanent . it be use to absorb vitamin d from the sun for the first 6 month of life in order to help it grow into a healthy adult . then it be cover by scale . tuatara fact sheet but the question persist as to why it seemingly devolve the need for that third eye if it originally have 3 work eye ? i mean , it do not simultaneously evolve a poison gland or some other form of defense to replace the need for it . now let us look at some insect which you will invariably mention as flaw in my argument . they too have extra eye call ocelli , not work eye mind you ; and neither do they aid in sight but the ocellus be simple structure and be believe they only detect light level and movement . now why would evolution not give vulnerable fly insect perfect vision when they have allegedly have literally hundred of million of year and many reason to evolve it ? be you aware that the visual acuity of insect be approximately 1 % of that of human ? and we all know that human do not have the best eye sight in the animal kingdom . microscopy - uk / micscape - insect insight . insect eye . honeybee leg . what really distinguishes evolutionist from creationists be that creationists will ask the question fear to ask since this fraudulent gospel have so many inconsistency which can not be reasonably or rationally answer , they refuse to even consider them . keep in mind that i have point out scientifically documented reality about what exist within the animal kingdom , but what i will get back from you be what ifs and maybes regard these inconsistency . why be it that you never look at what be evolutionary dogma and ask why if random mutation happens base on environmental , social and predatory pressure , have not it make more diverse selection where need , as in a working third eye in the back of animal head , rather than in all case follow a proscribed formula which exist today , just as it exist in the old fossil ever collect ? there be no need for prey animal to grow a third or forth eye as a defense mechanism . binocular vision work . its balanced and can render 3 d positioning in the mind accurately . the lizard that you mention be bear with a spot sensitive to light which help the body absorb vitamin d , as human do due to skin that be light - sensitive to a certain extent . it be not an eye for defend against predator , and it do not need one . as for insect , the fact that they have survive for such a long time go to show that they have adapt adequately and be do well . have you try sneak up on a fly lately ?	0

there be no way to judge on a case - by - case basis . what do you mean by this ? could we not have the law treat under - 18 capital offender on an individual basis , determine whether the individual offender in the individual case be sufficiently develop ? also , what would you say to the response that our current law provide that juvenile be sufficiently develop enough to have the responsibility , without parental involvement , to decide whether to obtain an abortion ? be it not a conflict to say juvenile should not be eligible for the death penalty because they be not morally develop enough , but at the same time say juvenile be morally develop enough to decide whether to obtain an abortion without involve their parent ?	0
you be waste your time phyllis , these spiritually dead empty suit be just too shallow to appreciate the value of a life they can not communicate with verbally . how pathetic they be not to appreciate that with all of the value and potential they see in themselves , that at one time they be exactly like these unborn child with the same mental existence they now claim be justification for their extermination . there be the potential for a human that come out of many , crude and vulgar thing . some end up on a maxi pad or when a guy reach for the box of kleenex . should i feel a special bond with the conception rudely flush out because they could not make it to the uterine wall ? they have the potential , the dna , be once a life too , and make a valiant effort . life be constantly in motion . we do not value all life , or maybe not all life the same . when it appear to have some aspect of human personhood , this would seem like a logical marker , where we ' d place great value .	1

so what activate gene ? when a gene product be need , a signal from its environment , not an emergent property of the gene itself , activate experession of that gene . in otherwords , it ' s the environment , stupid . `` pg / 52 so what you be say be simply that the gene do not actively control the body . what be wrong with assume that gene therefore do not control the body be the fact that the gene be the blueprint for the body . the gene decide the arrangement of cell , the number of finger , etc . the body , the cell , and the organelle within the cell be therefore strongly influence by the dna sequence .	0

then there be the argument that flaw in the death penalty lay with the judiciary system , not with the actual penalty itself . while anyone can accept that a “ perfect ” judiciary system would only send real murderer to death row , even if this be the case , it do not negate the problem mention before . well , what fault ? you say that innocent people be sentence to death far too often . well , the death penalty do not sentence people , our judiciary system do . the death penalty be mearly a punishment . i will agree that some innocent people have be send to death row , and when their innocence be discover , they be release . a perfect judiciary system would not sentence innocent people , and would alleviate all problem with the death penalty . if we have a perfect system and no innocent person be ever send to death row , we could take them directy from sentence to a little room beside the courtroom contain a bed and a few drug , put an iv in them , and carry out the sentence before the juror get out of the courthouse . of course , we know that our judiciary system be an imperfect thing , so we understand the need for appeal .	0

we simply do not evolve , there be no scientific proof just idea which change from day to day that also explain our siciety today . but there be evidence that we do evolve . i will give you an example . in area of west africa where malaria be endemic there be an allele of hemoglobin that confers resistance when heterozygous . in other environment that allele be not beneficial and be , in fact , deleterious . it be fatal when homozygous . now accord to evolutionary theory such an allele should decline where it offer no benefit . study show that this allele be less frequent by about 2 percentage point in american of west african ancestry .	0

the problem with your statement be that freedom of religion be specificly enumerate in the bill of right . government recognition of marriage be not . as i have tell mathew s on numerous occasion , you be free to put forth an initative , in your state , to ban government recognition of opposite sex marriage or all marriage . you be also free to vote your opinion on such initatives , but so be everyone else . marriage be not a religious institution . it be a government contract nothing more . many people choose to have a religious ceremony to celebrate their marriage but that doesnt make it a religious institution . need proof ? you can get marry without the permission of the church but you cant get marry without the permission of the government . and because marriage be a government institution then they can not discriminate against same sex couple and must provide the same benefit to them as be provide to straight couple . and it can not be a separate institution either because separate be not equal . but as i have already say this shouldnt be up for a vote . civil right never should be .	0

when place on the ballot instead of be ram down the public ' s throat by activist court and out - of - touch legislator , gay marriage have a zero - 31 record . the fact be that the public , when it exercise its constitutional right to decide via the ballot box , have decide against gay marriage every time . gay can not blame the christian right and the mormon for spend $ million on this one . in fact , gays spend a ton on this one . and it do not matter . and if the majority support banning christianity would that be ok just because the majority support it ? civil right should not be up for a vote ever no matter what .	1

saw a great article today by michael bloomberg ( yes , that michael bloomberg ) , about where the illegal gun use in crime come from - mainly from the state with weak gun control law . this be unsurprising to most rational folk , but yet we still hear the pro - gun clarion call to have no new gun law , etc . so here ' s the article for all to read : stop spread of illegal gun from state with weak law - cnn . com it be silly to focus on the tool and not bad people who misuse these tool , especially when the tool in question can be easily smuggle as well as make in a modestly - equipped machine shop . also , why do many of those who supposedly have a political orientation that favor freedom and oppose tyranny want to severely and arbitrarily limit the right of ten of million of people who have not , and show no indication of want to , unjustly hurt anyone with these tool ? it be wrong to tell people that they can not put certain substance in their body and have abortion , just as it be wrong to tell people that they can not have certain precision - machine metal / polymer / wood object in their own home .	0

thanks to an order sign by paul bremer , employee of u.s. contractor in iraq be beyond the reach of the iraqi criminal justice system , leave them effectively in a legal black hole . they could technically be try in u.s. federal court for offense commit in iraq , but logistically that would be very difficult and the justice department have show no interest in prosecute jones ' s case , mean her assailant almost certainly will not face any criminal penalty . why jamie leigh jones can ? t take halliburton to court | right and liberty | alternet so , once again , the lack of criminal prosecution be not due to the red herring that you claim , but rather the incompetence of the justice department . franken ' s bill do not have a provision for make the justice department do its job , do it ?	1

ok , let us give that a try . evolution do not require something to have evolve from nothing , so this be not a valid criticism . evolutionary theory seek to explain the plain fact of common descent . i know that . evolution release itself from its foundation at will . when it want to speculate about thing like abiogenesis and claim it to be science , it allow itself to do that . it ' s that interchangeability thing you speak of above .	1

i do not think lindsay lohan be a good example of any group of people . when i be young i work in retail and thief be everywhere . they just steal because they want stuff they could not afford . depend on what they be steal while you work in retail . and even if they do steal them , do they steal them to have them or to sell them for cash they could use on thing they need ? you would not know unless you follow their track after they steal . not to be a complete as , but what you be say sound a lot like the corporate propaganda i have be hear for year that encourage our culture to take a giant shit on the poor and law - breaker . when i be in high school lot of the kid steal stuff all the time . stuff their parent do not want to buy them , peer pressure etc . i be not try to be an as either i be just surprise at your view on this . maybe i will make a debate and we can see what people on here think .	0
no , faith and reason be mutually exclusive . science be base on reason . as prove above by definition of reason above , it all depend on what premise or start assumption you have as to what conclusion you will reason out . you be correct that faith do not neccessary require evidence . but there be usually always evidence to support the validity of a particular faith , in this case christianity .	0

no , but abiogenesis do , and they be 2 side of the same coin as they be present as one process follow the other . it be so deceptive and disingenuous to constantly separate them as unique process while all the time know that one study be the scientific continuation where the other end . you be play a game of semantics in order to claim they be not connect while all the while know that one study directly and specifically follow the other and build upon its claim as it continue on the explanation of how life evolve from single celled life form . so stop with the denial and word game and face the truth for once in your life . i know i be present fact to archie , sorry . archie , in point of fact you have it backwards . the theory of evolution be first , then abioegenesis . we know life exists . darwin , and others , explain how life change from what it use to be to what it be now ; they have no concern for where it come from in the first place , they simply know that it come from somewhere . how do they know it come from somewhere ? because there ' s life here now ! the answer to the question of where it all start do not get seriously study until well after darwin . so no , the one do not pick up from the other , and the study of evolution do not in any way depend on abiogenesis . evolution do not care where life come from , only what happen to it once it ' s around .	1
it may help to look at election in this way ( wow , i almost write evolution emoticonxic ) . god be deserve of all glory . in fact , because god be ultimate perfection , he seek to glorify himself . because human be not god , we be not deserve of his glory . in order for god to demonstrate his glory , through his characteristic of justice , he allow us to go to hell . however , another characteristic of his glory be that he be merciful . in his mercy he choose some to be save and with him in heaven . thus two of his characteristic be be glorify ( mercy and justice ) . and as i have already point out , this notion that god need to glorify himself smack of narcissism on a cosmic scale . why would god in any way need - - or even want - - to demonstrate his glory ? he ' s god : he know how glorious he be ! be not that enough ? and again , as already point out , i do not find arbitrary salvation of an undeserving few to be merciful , nor do i find arbitrary damnation of an undeserving many to be just . the calvinist vision of god strike me as a celestial tyrant .	0

nope , read the amendment . it clearly say nothing more than one branch , and one act of govern ( make law ) . no matter how much you ' d love for it to say more . it do not say a darn thing about ' remain neutral ' . really ? congress shall make no law respect an establishment of religion , or prohibit the free exercise thereof ; sound like a requirement to be neutral to me . it could be rephrase : ' do not meddle with religion ! do not regulate . neither promote nor inhibit .

i reckon that evolution be still just a theory for a valid reason . it be untrue and can not be prove . darwin himself say that his theory would be prove or disproven base on the future discovery of transitional fossil . there have be no such fossil ever find . that be the case , even darwin agrees that the theory of evolution be just man ' s folly . you all can write million of word about evolution , but what you lack be the proof of one discovery of transitional fossil the fact of the matter be that god create man in his own image . case close . hunter , would you be interest in actually discuss this logically ? or do you simply wish to toss out empty assertion and run away when challenge ? if your view be the truth , then you have no reason to run .	1

your reasoning would be applicable if only one copy of the gene in question ever exist . if the chance of mutation a happening be one in a billion , and the chance of mutation b happening be also one in a billion , then the chance of them both happen together to a single gene be , as you say , beyond the realm of possibility at 1 in 1,000 , 000,000 , 000,000 , 000 . however , we be not talk about a single gene . a population of a billion bacteria be nothing unusual , and all of them will contain the same gene . so while the odds of any individual experiencing mutation a be very low , the odds of one of them experience it be pretty high . the lottery work on the same principle . you probably will not win , but someone probably will . ok , so now we have our billion bacteria , one of which possess mutation a . however , the odds of mutation b stack with it be still only 1 in 1,000 , 000,000 . now , if mutation a be not particularly helpful , that ' s probably the end of the story . but if mutation a be helpful , then that bacterium will outcompete its peer for resource , and breed more readily than they do - either good in absolute term , or good in immediate proximity , when in competition for the same resource . either way , the proportion of the population possess mutation a will increase until they predominate . now there be not just one copy of the a - mutant gene in circulation , there be about a billion , and the odds of mutation b stack with just one of them be greatly improve . once again , if mutation b be helpful the descendent of that bacterium will flourish and overrun the population , so that in a relatively short time ( a few hundred bacterial generation ) a single cell possess neither mutation can give rise to a population of a billion all possess not one but two billion - to - one mutation - a population ready for the next billion - to - one mutation to occur , and stack , and flourish , and so on . i hope that help . well this be what i be say . the probability of a and b in one organism i very low . and the probability of a and b in many generation be low than just a . this be what behe deal with in his book . one reason evolution of primate interest me more than bacteria be the the number of organism and generation be much much low , and the change involve must be pretty big . it involve real evolution as oppose to stuff like antibiotic resistance or sicke cell haemoglobin that i see more as a reversable adaption , not a developement to a permanently good / more complex state . imo there should be possible to make some sort of calculation regard the probability of rm be cause of the change .	0
in a give environment ( e . g . a very cold region ) , some ( e . g . the long - haired dog ) will be more likely to survive , and so pass on their information , than others . natural selection can favour some set of information above others , and can eliminate some of the exist information in the population , but it can not create any new information . what be you talk about ? please define information . what do `` new `` information have to do with natural selection or evolution ? evolution be not define by evolutionary biologist as an increase in information . so i ask again , please define information in a meaningful way as it apply to dna and the genome of an organism .	0

we really be go around in circle on this . my bible through the rcc and jesus christ say all life be sacred include that life in the womb . then why do god order the killing of the unborn in the womb in hosea 13:16 . what do they ever do to god ? do god fear these people so much he have to have unborn member of their community kill . un born member who could not have possibly do anything to god !	1
the problem with id be that there be no evidence , and it be simply not possible to falsify it . if we be able to prove that our dating procedure be false and that really we stand on 2 leg back when the earth be create and that the fossil record be not really as we think it be , evolution would be falsify . intelligent design can simply not be falsify because there be no support evidence for it . that be the line between religion and science . the problem with happenstance origin be that there be no evidence , and it ' s simply not possible to falsify it . if we be able to prove so many scientific proceedures ( from abiogenesis to radiometric date - all base on the presupposition that there be no god ) be indisputably true , then id would be falsify . there be not enough support evidence for happenstance origin . yet so much of happenstance origin be consider science , so all too often , there be no line between religion and science .	0

more likely the criminal will shoot first rather than give the other chap a chance . there be no real reason for the average citizen to need or have a hand - gun the majority of criminal do not want to deal with trouble . most be not look for a shootout where there ' s a risk of them get shot at and most do not even want to shoot period . most be just look for the free stuff they can get or in case of rape they be definately not look to fight an arm victim . it have be show that criminal be less likely to break into a house whose owner have a gun .	0
my big problem with the gay right issue be their tireless and often deceptive effort to drag science into the whole thing . we know that there be nothing that tie biology and gene into sexual orientation , yet the gay society insist that there be , support shabby study with inconclusive result and publish them as fact . i have absolutely no problem with the gay lifestyle , marriage right or social place . but when it must be do under the guise of false science , there be a problem from what ive see , homosexuality , and sexuality on a whole , be indeed a complex issue . it be misunderstand , and many ' authority ' on the subject submit conflicting report , make the issue even more complicated . not only that , but people guard their sexuality with strong emotion , and therefore tend to believe what they want to believe about it . it make find the truth 10 time more difficult . we do ? how do we know that ? i will agree that there be not yet proof to make such a link , but i be unaware of proof that there be no link . do i miss something ?	0

the 9 / 11 commission omit the presence of molten steel from their official report . it take week for rescue worker to water - cool the glowing steel beneath the wreckage at ground zero . it be clearly and prominently visible in a thermal image take by a usgs satellite on september 16 - - five day later . in the video , one of the worker state that it have be almost 6 week after the attack , and worker be still try to cool down the steel . the 9 / 11 commission and supporter of the official story do not try to make the claim that office fire produce molten steel . they just ignore it . the 9 / 11 commission omit the presence of molten steel from their official report . the 9 / 11 commission omit it because ? . what be this deep dark secret they do not want the american public to know ? which , accord to you be easily figure out anyway .

quote : so it would make sense that a mold ( which be a type of fungus ) share the same common ancestor that other fungi share , and would have a lot of biochemical similarity with them which it would not share with bacteria . but would not the biochemical similarity speak for themselves ? that be , do one have to believe that the two specimen ( which share biochemical similarity ) evolve in order to infer that they will respond similarly to antibiotic ? the observable fact of the similarity would seem sufficient ( and more scientific ? ) .	0

i wasn ' t think the term ' micro - evolution ' but that do work . my point be that the idea of evolution be a gradual change over a long period of time . ( i have never head the term `` macro - evolution `` ( nor `` micro - evolution honestly ) but i assume that ' s what it be until you suggest different . ) i guess the change in beak size be more noticeable than gradual . my point for ask the question be from the selection that you quote . i point out what stick out to me . what i saw be that if the finch be evolve a small beak because of the large bill `` recent immigration , `` than that be a fast change for when the idea of evolution be gradual change over a long period of time , unless i misinterpret it . but then again , i think it ' s possible that `` micro - evolution `` do happen in some bird such as finch . it be ' change over time ' , not ' gradual change over time ' . the morphological change tend to happen with a change in the environment . the difference between ' micro ' evolution and ' macro ' evolution be the number of step . `` macro `` evolution be a bunch of ' micro ' evoltultions that add up . you have two population that you can compare that use to interbreed , and for some reason , do not , and then you add on a few 1000 ' mircro - evolution ' event to each , they become very very different .	0

but i see two people involve here . whether the woman be good off or not be irrelevant to me . she have no right to kill the other just like you have no right to kill your neighbor . i be not for allow decision on everything and to be against `` choice `` be not a bad thing consider every law restrict choice . but the embryo be a mere clump of flesh inside of a woman ' s body . science prove it . it have no sign of intelligence , it be merely cell at this stage . therefore , it can not be refer to as another person , or neighbor , and be no where near comparable to a human . choice that harm another should be illegal , but choice regard your own personal liberty and freedom should be make by the individual . not the government .	0
this be not very helpful to you . first off , you be talk to a right winger . second , you be not debate with someone who have do this to you , though i think your claim be questionable . after all , you can not get into response much after two day . maybe if you show me where they have do this , then this claim might have some validity . and now it ' s time for you to address my point , which you have not do yet . you two be on the same side , you just do not know it yet . and you be both friend of mine so shake hand and make up willya ? emoticonxhohoemoticonxgoodand yes ' s video be very disturbing because it show that in a time of natural catastrophe ' s or mass turmoil , our government will confiscate gun from law abide citizen . during the la riot after the rodney king verdict , the gov ' t order all gun shop to lock down and to stop sell ammunition . so even law abide citizen with legally register weapon could not buy ammo to protect themselves .	0

some iowa county recorder say they have contemplate refuse to give a marriage license to gay couple who walk into the office , but so far none be vow to do so . “ this be put us in a very , very difficult position here , ” wayne county recorder angela horton say thursday in an interview . “ but sometimes you have to put aside your personal belief , your religious belief , when you be do a job you have swear under oath to provide . ” after hear rumbling of discontent , a state official send a strongly worded note to all recorder thursday explain why they should obey the iowa supreme court rule legalize same - sex marriage when it take effect april 27 . victoria hutton of the iowa department of public health inform recorder that the ruling have the force of law statewide : “ all county recorder in the state of iowa be require to comply with the varnum decision … and to issue marriage license to same sex couple in the same manner as license issue to opposite gender applicant . ” republican state senator on thursday craft a new proposal that would give recorder an out if their religion be oppose to gay marriage , but senate democratic leader mike gronstal scorn it as “ blatantly unconstitutional . ” state to county : obey gay marriage ruling , issue certificate | desmoinesregister . com | the de moines registerwhy be it that people of religion keep try to seek special privilege for their religious belief ? do your job , or get out of the office . why be it any more special for a `` christian `` to have a `` religious `` belief against homosexuality , as oppose to a non - christian have a `` non - religious `` belief against homosexuality ? but let me guess . if they step down right after they find they will have to issue to gay couple , you ' d be in favor of them be able to be sue for it , simply because the `` discrimination `` in such an event be toward gay ? right ? at least if you be consistent with your stance elsewhere in regard to ' time ' . emoticonxrolleyesanyway , aside from that inconsistency with your position elsewhere , i agree that county official should need to comply . after all , there be probably other example whereby county official have to do thing that they be religiously against , such as issue divorce paper . or marry some drunk couple that they know be not really be serious even though they be tie the knot . if all county official could just refuse to do their job because of their objection - - for whatever reason - - it would be a collosal mess .	0
promote renewables be a good thing , but increase the supply of oil in counter productive in help renewables to reach the critical mass need to survive economically . if we could rub a brass lamp , make three wish and fix our energy problem immediately , i ' d agree with you . but since we live in the real world , we must become oil independent while we be perfect and build an infrastructure of renewable energy source .	1

i watch a program on einstein and his theory of relativity yesterday on the history channel . good stuff . i be a little interested in what he be work on when he croak - the unification theory . that will develop more in time and then i will pay more attention to it . i think god be the great physicist , and we will see the beauty of his law of physic in due time . ' for the scientist who have live by his faith in the power of reason , the story end like a bad dream . he have scale the mountain of ignorance ; he be about to conquer the high peak ; as he pull himself over the final rock , he be greet by a band of theologian who have be sit there for century . ' ( nasa astronomer robert jastrow , god and the astronomer , p . 116 . ) you havent answered my question . if evolution be lack the hard , observable evidence you say it ' s lacking , then surely you should have lot to say about atomic theory . however , you dont . why not ? unification theory be different - theres no dependency on that theory like there be with chemistry or biology .	0
good way to prove exactly what i be talk about christianists and these dominionists in particular want to oppress gay people . poor little poopie . if your gay sex agenda wasn ' t of the devil himself you might be good receive in the world .	1
er , you possess an extremely sick mind which be obsess with sex . have you never seek counsel for your malady ? what ' s sick be your theological comprehension . god take ananias and sapphira ( act chapter 5 ) off the earth just for lie . and you want to give jfk , the serial adulterer , a pas ? that ' s how lame your theological thinking be .	1
so what be it you be look for ? sympathy ? yes , i be sorry you have to go through that . i would not wish that on anyone . it sound like you definitely have a difficult time and i can understand why you may have hesitate in a decision to let him live . be you look for mother always have access to medical care which you almost do not have ? i agree , they all should . though i do not think you would have be turn away at most any hospital - - it probably happen on rare occassion . but i agree , woman should have whatever medical care they need . if you be look for me to say that ' abortion be ok in some circumstance ' , i can not do that unequivocally . if the life of the mother be in definite danger , then yes . i be look for you to recognize that a pregnancy can not successfully happen without address the circumstance of the mother - whatever those may be . you can dismiss everything but health / life of the mother but i can pretty damn well assure you she will not . and whether you like it or not - the pregnancy can not succeed without her . get it ? she be not a barbie you can bend to your will with law . do you see her ? do you recognize that baby grow and live inside woman ? address all her issue or you will fail in your endeavor . oh - and i do not require your sympathy - my life be great .	1
why do the ' love ' christian always threaten eternal torment when you ask them for information ? i do not know , terran . be you scared poohbear ? do you actually have any evidence to bring to us ? we ' d love to see some ! really we would ! if you could show us some hardcore , physical evidence that prove god do it , it would be the scientific revelation of the century ! oh what ' s that ? you do not have any ? not even a poorly craft straw - man argument ? damn , and here i be think you be capable . oh yes , and if you could give us some firm , solid evidence that darwin be burn in hell , we would all drop our copy of origin and bow down the lord . whats that ? you do not have any ? . 	1
private ownership of gun may indeed add to the number of weapon hold by criminal , but it be not their major source of weapon . they buy them . the market will never go away . the manufacturer will not cease make them . if you can not eliminate demand you could try to limit supply and control access to that supply .	0

a very good friend of mine have a master in theology from an accredited institution . she be also host my wedding to my partner in the fall . she be a christian but she doen ' t share your belief . your partner would not happen to be a guy , would he ? as for your christian friend , ask her to join the fray . i ' d like to ask her a few question , such as : who do you say jesus christ be ? if not lord , god , savior , and jewish messiah then she be on the wrong page . ask her if people need jesus christ for redemption for their sin ? ask her if people should repent of their sin and turn from them ? ask her who the holy spirit be ? if not god , then she ' s on the wrong page ( note act 5 ) . ask her if the bible do not say gay sex be a sin ( leviticus 18:22 , lev . 20:13 , romans 1:26 - 27 ; i corinthians 6 : 9 - 10 ; jude 7 , etc . ) ? those will do for starter .	0
as mr . jack say , interest . actually , i mean the behaviour refer to in her post be interest .	0
i believe in spinoza ' s god who reveal himself in the orderly harmony of what exist , not in a god who concern himself with the fate and action of human being . i can not imagine a god who reward and punish the object of his creation , whose purpose be model after our own - - a god , in short , who be but a reflection of human frailty . neither can i believe that the individual survive the death of his body , although feeble soul harbor such thought through fear or ridiculous egotism . a man ' s ethical behavior should be base effectually on sympathy , education , and social tie and need ; no religious basis be necessary . man would indeed be in a poor way if he have to be restrain by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death . scientific research be base on the idea that everything that take place be determine by law of nature , and therefore this hold for the action of people . for this reason , a research scientist will hardly be incline to believe that event could be influence by a prayer , i . e . by a wish address to a supernatural be . and stephen hawking , the only thing he have say be `` i do not believe in a personal god `` , which would make him a pantheist or deist at best .	0
at least with sport the best player be fairly easily identify , everyone can watch them in action and judge for themselves . with corporate officer it be much more ambiguous . there be no indication that firm be actually compete for the top talent , they just seem to be cycle around the same face and award themselves ever large pay rise . do the enormous pay of ceo help the economy ? probably not . would prohibit enormous pay of ceo ( threaten to fine or imprison people if they violate an arbitrary cap on salary ) help the economy ? certainly not . be rawls argument correct , and all that remain be for us to work out the detail of a totalitarian state to enforce his ideal ? no .	0
i be not argue that gun control will change the nature of men - though gun may make them more willing and confident to engage in crime . with guns criminal can do even more damage . add gun to crime be like add gasoline to a fire - it make an already exist problem worse . if you think that just as many people die from stab and beating in other developed nation as people die from gun in the us then you need to do more research . you be apparently unwilling to extend your think process to the other side of the argument galileo , and by this i mean , and repeat that it be not criminal own hand gun which we defender of gun right be fight for . we agree that criminal shouldn ' t be arm , and the law already exist on the book to punish them when convict criminal be catch with gun . but your solution to disarm all honest citizen in the belief that this will make them unavailable to criminal also be ludicrous to the point of self destructive insanity . it be that premise which we be fight against through the nra and other lobbying effort .	1
the topic do not change . the topic be the reason for the french no vote which certain poster originally claim be a vote against chirac , and when i ask them to back it up with evidence . the only ' evidence ' they could cite be that commentator say that , so it be so . when i say that i hear commentator say that turkey and fear of globalisation be the main reason for the french no vote , then the same poster who have earlier claim that the french no vote be a vote against chirac now change their tune and say turkey and fear of globalisation be reason as well . so please keep with the thread of this disucussion will you . i know its hard work for you but try to remember how this topic get start in the first place . french like turkey even the yank eat turkey . what have a turkey get to do with the french voting no ! by the way , why do you spell turkey with a capital t ?	1
man stab , kill 8 child outside school in china the biblical end have get to be near . this be a doctor who spend all of his life save people ' s life . and he accomplish all this human carnage without a gun . this just prove that if it be possible to eliminate all projectile fire weapon from exist on earth , men would find a way to commit atrocity against his own kind just as he do before such weapon exist if murder be in his heart . gun be not the issue , the corrupted heart / nature of humanity be .	0

 nonsense ! what it be a reflection of be the sense of paranoia that the hard right religious radical lunatic fringe have create ever since 9 / 11 . if you be panic , suck it up ! others have suffer far bad and have manage to keep their perspective . the non - stop drumbeat from the chicken littles on the right be responsible for this and no one else . cheney on meet the press this morning be a perfect example of this destructive attitude . omg , be you for real ? i ' d think that if you saw a plane fly low , be chase by a fighter jet , you ' d get out of the way . any sane person would . far , you ' d be peeve if you find out that it be your govt . be completely insensitive ( not to mention wasteful ) . the govt . screw up . if it have be bush you ' d be cry bloody murder .	1
the kind aussie be ban . that right there . you be the ' legend in your own mind ' type . self - fluffer . ho hum . that ' s a span of about 40 year . my point be that graphic depiction of rape be rare in film . clearly you do not understand the formula for slasher film . the aussie be ban publication and film of woman with small breast . if you think that mens mag like nut be pornographic you be a little sad . dont mix with other men much . mother tell you sex be dirty ? oh dear the porn expert be insinuate that i must be get my rock off . see above happy graphic depiction of rape be freely available in video and so be not ' rare ' . expert on slasher film with ' teenage trollop get kill . see above happy 	1
i think this be unlikely under the current makeup of the supreme court . but that of course be the fear that many have , i . e . , that gay marriage would be impose via judicial fiat ( whether at the state or federal level ) rather than through legislative mean . well , let us be honest here . people fear gay marriage , not that it might come about via judicial fiat . that ' s just the current whipping horse because that ' s how it happen first , for some broad value of judicial fiat of course . there be a recent post here about right grant gay by their state legislature , oregon i think , and a group jump in and force the law on hold via a petition drive . so it really be not the mean by which gay get equality that upset some folk , it ' s the equality itself . `` judicial fiat `` be just a phrase people can use so they can avoid state their true motif , prevent gay from be treat as equal .	0
look im 16 ihave two hour in class i get home at 3 be so get off my back you old hag and im sorry if my spell isnt as good as you think i go to coolidge high school maybe you should google it ok find it on map ok it be not appropriate on this site to call people names . i understand that you be still learn in school and be busy , but i think that they teach basic spelling and grammar at a much early age than 16 , so there be really no excuse ! i do take the time to google your school , but you be too young to realize that maybe this be not the only coolidge h in the country . so i go with the first google result . i be not impressed , the school get a 4 out of 10 and 3 out of 5 star from parent !	0
anti - abortion legislation be simply a tool by which they try to maintain a less sexually permissive society , believe that if woman who fall pregnant outside of marriage be force to endure pregnancy and likely child - raise alone , rather than be offer an easy way out , they will be less likely to have sex outside of marriage . i think you fail to take into account that for most opposer of abortion , they genuinely feel they be try to save life by their opposition . in many case it ' s not a matter of try control sexual prermissiveness in society but prevent life from be kill . disagree or not , you can not separate the anti - abortion message from the fact that it hold to the view that abortion be a form of murder .	0
oh , i know what he be try to establish there . i do want him to own up and admit what he be try to establish . do not expect him to , but hey , `` miracles `` happen ( accord to him ) . : pin fact , as a return question , i ' d like to ask him : do someone rely on the odyssey to establish the existence of pallas athene , circe or calypso ? because the iliad and odyssey do not claim to be divine do not mean they should be place under a different threshold as the bible . otherwise , it ' s special plead on your part , and thus logically fallacious . this be one of many inconsistency between skeptic in regard to the scrutiny of the bible . they be unwilling to put the standard they have on the bible against other book similar in age . if they do , there would not be a single book leave standing .	0

felony arrest , severe mental illness or disturbance ( like the kind that get you off of felony murder charge because you be find not competent to stand trial , or not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect ) , drug addiction , or treasonous action against the country ( not the current government , but the country itself ) . if obama have his way , stand against the government would be the most patriotic thing someone could do .	0
but nobody be force you to support anti - catholic policy . of course , you have the right to support them , but do not try to make it sound as if you be not make a conscious choice to do so . that ' s hypocritical . when my religious beliefs bump into the law , i have never have a gun held to my head by someone say `` support the law or else `` . i guess you never think that many cathoilics have gay in their family , or should they ask them to take their life ?	1

so if same - sex relationship be legally recognize as `` marriage , `` the idea of marriage as a sexually exclusive and faithful relationship will be deal a serious x . add monogamy and faithfulness to the other pillar of marriage that have already fall will have overwhelmingly negative consequence for american ' physical and mental health . see above . whether a couple be or be not monogomous be not for you to determine or worry about . and speak for yourself if you do not mind . this member of the american public ' s mental health be just fine thank you very much . if gay marriage impact you that much , well that sound like your problem .	0
i must say , that first paragraph you write really interest me . i have become so accustomed to speak to hereditary theist that i wasn ' t sure it be even possible to be religious with atheist parent . if you do not mind my ask , who introduce you to christianity ? or be it some sort of overnight process , as in you wake up and just believe through some some divine revelation ? i be surprise , maybe your area of the uk be different , but in mine nearly all atheist be hereditary , or they just break away from the religion of their parent because they dislike their parent instead of the religion .	0
you should also note that the one scenario i think the death penalty be acceptable for be if they try to escape use violence or if they attack another prisoner . this have show that they be willing to commit act of violence and frankly have nothing to lose . so the initial murder wasn ' t enough to show `` that they be willing to commit act of violence `` ? this make absolutely no sense .	0

hey archie , have you watch for the bible tell me so yet ? what do that have to do with the issue be discuss ? unless you be suggest that for gay to refer to themselves as ethmi do be an expression of self loathing . be that the point you be try to make ? beside , by present a film with dick gephart and gene robinson as example of god fearing christian , you immediately expose yourself as someone who have no concept of what a true believer in christ be . so why should a film that be nothing more than secular humanist propaganda be take seriously at all ?	0

it be entirely premature to be discuss this matter for the purpose of promote political position and belief . it be also disrespectful to those that die and their family to try and capitalize on their pain for a political agenda . no relevant detail have be discover or release yet mean all that can be have be pure speculation and hyperbole . the simple fact that authority be able to apprehend the individual before he could commit suicide place us as a whole in a unique situation . the law abide responsible gun owner who gun them down do so respectfully , right ? emoticonxfrazzledyou gun crazy be the only one with a sick political agenda , you ought to be all send to a loony bin and give water pistol .	1

rubbish , there be many that argue otherwise . the life of twin can be view as start at the moment the zygote / embryo split for example . the reality though be there be no single point at which a human life begin : the moment the egg and sperm form , the moment of conception , first division and implantation , the moment the heart start to beat , the moment of birth etc all mark stage in the formation of a new life . oh yeahrubbish rubbish , scientifically speak , human life ( use a most bsic term ) begin at conception . the twin exist as two seperate entity the moment each contain the individual human dna . seem to me you good be certain when it begin before you go around end it . if you be drive at night an you `` think `` you might see a person ahead in the middle of the road you be hopefully not gon na drive over that person . instead that uncertainty should lead you to stop . if you dont like that example , consider a hunter who be unsure what be in the bush .	0

 schumer : ok . now , let me ask you this . when you write that statement , you do not - - as we discuss yesterday - - when you write that the constitution do not protect the right to an abortion , you have no exception . so that would mean , at least in 1985 , your view then , there would be no constitutional protection for a woman to terminate her pregnancy even if the termination be need to preserve her future ability to have child , right ? alito : senator , it be a general statement that do not go into - - it do not . schumer : but it have no exception . you do not make that . alito : it be one sentence , and it certainly do not represent . schumer : there be no - - you do not write any exception for that situation . correct ? it just say the constitution do not protect . it be without exception . and , yesterday , you do not argue me when i mention that without exception . alito : i do not recall your use the word without exception . schumer : i think i do . ( crosstalk ) schumer : if you believe . alito : could i just answer that question ? it ' s one sentence and it certainly be not an attempt to set out a comprehensive view of the subject . schumer : no , i understand that . but it be a very strong statement . it do not talk about any exception at all . and the way i read that statement , even if a woman be rap by her father , she ' d have no constitutional protection to have an abortion and terminate that pregnancy . if you believe the constitution protect no right to an abortion that would follow , would not it ? alito : i think the statement speaks for itself , and it ' s one sentence and it ' s not an effort to set out a comprehensive view of . schumer : know these example , do you still refuse to distance yourself in any way from a broad , unqualified statement , without exception , that the constitution do not protect the right to an abortion ? no ands , ifs or buts , be my word . alito : what i actually say be that i be proud of my participation in the thornburg case in which the government make the argument that it make in the thornburg case . schumer : but you say in the previous sentence to that statement that you personally hold those view . alito : that ' s correct . but what i be talk about there be the thornburg case and nothing more than the thornburg case . schumer : i understand . but you have not rethink the position at all , even know these extreme case and the hardship that it might cause ? alito : well , what you have point out be exactly why , if the issue be to come up , and one be to get beyond stare decisis , the whole judicial decision - making process would have to be go through . schumer : you do not think that through in 1985 ? alito : i be not involve in . schumer : when you write the statement . when you write that statement . alito : and when i write the statement what i be say be that i be proud of what i have do in relation to the thornburg case , which be to write the memo that the committee be aware of , which do not argue that roe should be overrule , do not argue that the government should argue that roe should be overrule , but that the decision should be challenge on other ground that be quite similar . schumer : i understand what you write , but you also - - we can bring the statement up here , but i do not want to go over the thing of yesterday . i would just ask you to think of all the consequence of a broad statement , even from 1985 , that the constitution do not protect the right to abortion . not an exception of health of the mother , not an exception of rape or incest , not an exception of any of these others . i do not see any of those in your job application . but i want to conclude on . alito : senator . schumer : go ahead , please . alito : it be one sentence . and i think what you be say highlight the importance of not address this until the judicial process take place where all of this complexity would be take into account . schumer : in all due respect , sir , i think it highlight the importance of an obligation to discuss it , particularly in light of a strong statement before . but we will have to differ on that . schumer be a bonafide idiot , as be many in the senate . he failingly try to draw alito into expose how he would rule on abortion if present a case . alito be far too intelligent to be logically trap by a buffoon such as shumer . it be also plain to see he interrupt when he suppose the response will indeed make sense against his flailings .	0

( if anything it say life start at birth with the first breath ) like the above quote , why be the church try to stop abortion when they would consider one to be alive after take a breath . if you be to look at it from a scientific standpoint , the individual ovum and sperm be live cell , but they die all the time and no one care . an embryo or fetus be something start to develop into a human and that can not be stop without kill it or inject differnt dna , but it ' s still not too different from sperm and ovum . if you can not trust the church to make fair decision and follow value and moral and rule they put in place , how can you expect an honest good decision about anything from it .	0

' . ahh but what if all the shirt have only american flag on them . would it them be a group of patiotic american and their child ? i mean you do tend to see american flag wear , include tee shirt , everywhere . would it still be consider a protest if all of them have american flag shirt on them . ah joe i it hit me of course this be like ghandis ' salt march .	1
i think his point be paulie , that if evolution be actually as evo defines it , as change make by way of random mutation , then why do not life reflect those random mutation ? for example , why have not a large number of low animal who live their life be hunt by carnivore adapt eye in the back of their head as a need early warn system to see their stalker come from behind them ? especially in time of drought and famine when food be scarce ? the environmental pressure exist at those time to justify such a change , yet from fish to bird to reptile to mammal to even insect , most every creature in creation have 2 eye , 1 mouth , 2 ear , ( if they even have ear since some animal use vibration sensor to locate the movement of prey and predator . ) it make sense that eagle , hawk and falcon have only 2 eye since they be apex predator which rule their sky . but they regularly swoop down on small bird and pluck them out of the sky for food for their young . so why have not small bird find the need to evolve eye in the back of their head ? they have . prey animal have their eye to the side of their head which allow them to see in every direction , almost 360 degree around . predator animal have their both eye face forward .	0
emoticonxdonno sorry , but intelligent and dynamic lifeforms do not refute naturalistic theory of evolution . idism be a dead duck . indeed , it be neither intelligent nor dynamic . toe be a mechanistic theory - - it say life be like a machine . machine be not intelligent , they just do what they be make / program to do . darwinists say lifeforms do what they do because of the way their particular gene program them . this be basic stuff . yet you come along and say this be not so . so which be it ? be life intelligent or not ? if it be intelligent , what be illogical about believe life be design intelligently by an intelligent designer ? the intelligence have to come from somewhere . where do the information in the dna code come from ?	0

. if we see relatively few creationists on these board , all that mean be , there relatively few creationists on these board . that do not prove anything . right ? let do some thinking here . but the point be why be there relatively few creationists . the reason be that the creationist position can not be defend in open debate . that be why creationist board censor oppose view . on board where creationists be not protect there be few .	0

i be still have a hard time with this . if nothing exists , no matter , then how can `` the number one `` exist ? on what basis be it define ? if there be only nothing , then you can not add to it , like i say 0 + 0=0 . i know this be get slightly off topic and philosophical , but it would seem to me that `` concept `` , and i be not sure exactly how that ' s be define , must have a basis in reality , and therefore in matter . i agree in that they be not create . i disagree in that imho , they be a function of our physical universe . imho , you do not have the concept without the universe to `` define `` it . i do not know , it ' s too early in the be , maybe someone can point out the error in my thinking . waxy addition work in the intangible as well . 1 minute + 1 minute = 2 minute . 1 idea + 1 idea = 2 idea . the concept of quantity be not limit to matter . if there be just a vaccous void be absolutely nothing be happen , then there would be no application of logic . but even that in itself would be logical . nothing + nothing = nothing be logical . it would actually be logical if a void with nothing add to it result in something . so even in a void , logic still prevail	0
and again , it be only write that way in that era to limit the federal government from make law that give preference to one religion or another ; i . e . anothers person faith could not receive preferential treatment over your own . the 1 4 th amendment far say that the state can not pass any law the abridge the right you have as a federal citizen so a state can not pass a law either that give preference to a different faith than your own , the same limitation as the federal government . if you want to use this arguement then you be assume a right to free speech seperate from the 1 st amendment . you be apply the first amendment but rather assume ' free speech ' be a right grant outside of the constitution . i believe our argument be deal with apply the first amendment to the state . the case do not deal with the first amendment at all . where do you get that idea from ? it deal with religion but that be about as close as it get . ok ? be there ever any doubt that the 1 st amendment be incorporate since cantwell ?	0

if you have quote a scientific journal then it would be different . as i show , it be not a scientific , peer - review journal , but rather a membership journal you pay for publishing in , ie . a ' vanity journal .

why be the choice of religion more worthy of constitutional protection that any other choice . emoticonxconfused well for one thing religion be specificly mention in the constitution , not as 100 % protect but in that gov ' t can not mandate a religion . also , religion be not unilateraly protect , as i have state several time . there be many restriction put on religion by government and if government can restrict religion then why not which marriages they recognise ? that be say i have long be a supporter of limited gov ' t and believe that gov ' t have no business endorse or give advantage to any marriage . they should be silent on the subject .	0

you know , i think that you be rather an evil person , try to create guilt where no guilt exist , where no guilt be necessary . someone make a very important decision at a critical point in her life which make her life well and avert the consequence of a stupid mistake make by a youth . it be not an easy decision for her to make but she make it and it ' s well in the past , except for the people who want her to feel guilt and trauma about it . good lesson ! always take the easy way out to try and avoid consequence of action . instead of leave a note on a car say you accidently hit you . you should just casually drive away . thanks simone !	1
what about other ' rational ' alternative to your version of evolution ; such as that postulate by id theorist ? intelligent design come in many flavor too . id that submit as a designer something that have any quality of the unknowable be irrational . id that submit we be create / design by thing inside the universe that be knowable be rational claim . however , they have no evidence , so they have a long way to go to be show to be worthwhile to pursue . even a simple application of occam ' s razor tell us that to suspect a thousand theory on how life have change on earth be unecessary when another theory can fulfill the description entirely , of life , and they have evidence to support it . it ' s why this theory be discard onto the heap of any number of theory that simply be not go anywhere . you can make up a theory right now about how life begin , but if it can not be support by evidence or be redundant to a theory already describe . why would we ?	0

its pretty clear that the attribute of god be make up along the way over the course of history , for different motivation from explain disaster and natural phenomenon , to comfort greiving love one , to control the mass and justify the whim of the ruler . when thing start to get hairy in term of logical contradiction , they throw in `` god move in mysterious way `` and `` god ' s way be high than ours `` , in an attempt to shut up the independent thinker with question the priest could not answer . truly genius , the legacy still go strong to this day . i agree , it be pure genius . especially how it have infiltrate politics and government . emoticonxbanghead	1
because people : can not admit their fault , can not tell others theirs , want to look good to their peer ; and because people be selfish . i really find it pathetic . this be why i stop lie when i be young , because i saw how much everyone else do it , and just saw it as pathetic , and do not want to be like everyone else . i have not lie in 1 year . good u not lie in 1 yr . good progress . but till what time ? . life can show any moment at any time . no one know about it . not lie be good but sometimes your truth can kill or hurt someone dear . 	0

but why do you think that doubt limit people ' s idea ? if anything it help to expand them . it can go both way . we all doubt . it be what you do with it that matter . [ quote = gnojek ] if a child grow up never hear the word religion , god , spirit , etc . would this child still have faith of some sort ? be faith some innate human tendency ? it could be see as how there be the `` god spot `` in the brain , but maybe the god spot would not develop as fully in the child that be never expose to religion or thought of the supernatural . quote ] look around . faith do not spontaneously generate out of thin air . it be obviously part of our psyche . every civilization throughout history have felt the need for some type of faith . even on different side of the planet . it ' s as natural as the sun rising .	0
 evolution a fact ? why be we tell that darwin ' s theory of evolution be a scientific fact - - even though many of its claim be base on misrepresentation of the fact ? really ? then why do you start off your little rant by admit that `` . microevolution can not be reasonably dispute . `` evolution have be observe , and that be a fact . speciation in both plant and animal have be observe , and that be a fact . apparently you do not know what a theory be . might it not be wise to learn just a little about science before you make yourself look so foolish ? theory explain fact .	1

as explain the last time we cross path matthew , there be no evidence present that would suggest homosexualism be in any way a legitimate aspect of life for differentiate one from another . simply because you possess different sexual ideal from someone else do not mean that you and those like you be worth special consideration by society . your continued comparison of homosexual to black do nothing to make your point anymore valid . religion be nothing but a choice but be constitutionally protect . why ? black and homosexual be two different class , unless you be a black gay . it be the way each class be treat that be the same . coservative christian view gay people in the same way as the white supremacist view black people . the more religion attack gay people and our civil right the more i be begin to believe that the roman have the right idea to rid the world of such filth .	0
ah , well , then you in you ' broad and unprejudiced view ' emoticonxrolleyesemoticonxrolleyes can obviously tell us those suppose myriad other view . i wait with bated breath for your answer . the simple and most usual one would be bluntly that marriage be and always have be between member of the opposite sex . there may possibly have be some strange aberration in the past but essentially that have always be the bottom line even for homosexual . in addition to those there will be those who oppose it on religious ground . and why should not they if they so wish ? marriage be an institution not a right . if you do not qualify then you do not enter . by all mean campaign to have the rule change but do not be surprise if they be not .	0

yes , it ' s suppose to be a ceteris paribus problem . okay , so people seem fairly agree that , all else equal , less wrongful death be preferable to more wrongful death . now what i be curious about be eddie ' s third assumption , ' assumption three : two bad thing be bad than 1 bad thing ' . now , it ' s obvious that there be a great quantity in the number of thing , but how do that quantity of thing entail a low moral quality of the outcome ? be two ' wrong ' more ' wrong ' than one ' wrong ' ? or perhaps , be two ' bad ' more ' bad ' than one ' bad ' ? i would say so . but perhaps that ` s just my utilitarian leaning talk .	0

save life be a republican goal ? then , why have the republican condemn us to this ugly , nonproductive war in iraq ? the terrorist continue to terrorize us because we have deter our effort against them to iraq , ( and bush intend to widen this nonproductive war into iran and syria ) where nearly 700,000 iraqi have be needlessly slaughter , where more than 3,000 of our young have be sacrified in vain , and you have the audacity to say that `` save life be a republican goal . `` meanwhile we burn saudi arabian oil and by so do , fuel the funding of countless school of hate against the united state throughout the world . osama bin laden , the prime terrorist in the world , issue out of saudi arabia . he be fund by saudi arabia . most of the terrorist on those plane that attack my nation on september 11 , 2001 , be from saudi arabia . iraq have nothing to do with that attack . iran have nothing to do with that attack . syria have nothing to do with that attack . ever have an attack of reality , gman ? simone , read the sentence again please . it be `` save live be `` not just `` a republican goal . `` it concern the subject of abortion . the only way it relate to the politics of iraq , be that abortionist would rather kill our kid before they get to `` volunteer `` their service for iraq . i can not let one statement you make go though . terrorist continue to terrorize us ? where have they attack in the u.s. since 9 - 11 ? consider continue this in an appropriate thread .	1
what ' s the scoop here ? it seem to me with all the shooting that occur in the united state because of all the gun happy nut run around , everyone would know how to do first aid at the site of a shooting . good idea simone , when do you start your training . i understand bullet wound be kind of nasty because they be deep . there ' s also the massive loss of blood ; to be sure , the massive bleeding would wash out nasty debris but a body can not stand to lose a bunch of blood . well so be fall out of a building onto a piece of rebar . or get mash in a car crash . there be a lot more of those than shooting but you do not seem to care . why be that ? be it because you love to dance in blood ?	1
if anyone think liberal be overly intelligent compare to conservative just look at california and new york , and that elitist turkey in the white house , who ' s bankrupt the country . there be undoubtedly many intelligent liberal , but the one i have see be a full quart low on godly wisdom . intelligence and godly wisdom be not the same thing . your definition of `` godly wisdom `` be agree with your political position and your spurious theological justification for them , so it ' s hardly surprising you do not encounter any liberal who you think have `` godly wisdom ``	1

absolutely . even bad be the right of unmarried father , who seem to have no right whatsoever just because they never marry the mother of the child . i completely believe that father can be just as good parent as mother , even well in some case . but everything be mother centre when it come to parent , for example , why be baby change area always within the woman toilet ? what be men suppose to do if they take out their baby themselves ? off topic i know but it ' s infuriating ! no , i completely agree . it ' s frustrating from a woman ' s point of view also . do this mean that if a father and mother take their child out somewhere , it ' s solely the woman ' s responsibility to take care of the child ? thing should definitely be level when it come to parent .	0

umm no we feel these thing because be indoctrinate by your pastor , your prayer leader , and grow up feel like be scum because you people have nothing well to do than scapegoat others to make your own crazed belief more believable . and by the way i be not easily offend by my sexuality or even the word x . do not like it ? pray or picket , or have a heart attack . point be get over it . then why be it that closet homosexual that be completely unknown to be gay commit suicide at such a high rate ? they be not persecute or harass at all since no one know they be even have these feel ? it be self loathe that feed their desire to harm themselves . people who know that what they be be right and good , do not harm themselves at all , but defend and support who they be even when persecute by others . that ' s how it be for me when i convert from islam to christianity . all of the persecution i receive just make me strong .	0

have to be careful not to over - complicate the page , but for once its sometimes difficult to tell whether a reply be in favor or opposition . great job otherwise , love the site . i feel the opposite be true . i feel a lack of hierarchy add complication to the layout . it ' s pretty functional do not get me wrong . freak cool site , but i mean you have all this opportunity to explore hierarchy and color ( brand = two color , blue / orange , argument have 2 choice . ) . they even dabble in it a little with the ' add argument ' button above . the grid structure of the layout seem mildly confusing as well . for instance , the vertical alignment of usernames with their respective argument could match up more uniquely to aid in clarity . or if the lead ( space between line of text ) wasn ' t so consistent , each ' argument ' might be good frame visually , without the addition of graphic or color . obviously , this be not gospel or some fantastic soultion , i just think lack of color could be one of a few idea on improve clarity and functionality of the site .	0
oh man . you keep ignore the historical context of the issue . back in 1967 , `` societal view of marriage `` meant same race marriage only , by an overwhelming majority that supercede that see today against gay marriage . by a margin of 3 to 1 , people disapprove of interracial marriage . society `` view `` marriage as `` between a man and a woman of the same race `` . back in 1967 , societal view of marriage be opposite - sex . wait . it ' s still that way .

the day when you have to walk into that abortion clinic and make that decision , you stand up and tell me what a real man be . those poor girl and woman who go through abortion do what they have to do , more than you could ever do . do not stand on your high horse and lecture the world on the virtuousness of your position . do not talk about be virtuous , be virtuous . a `` real man `` help those who he love , whether he like what they do . a father love his son and daughter , despite what they do , rather in spite of what they have do . good day to you . right on ! a real man support those he love , through thick and thin . he do not try and control the thing he can not either . in the end , it ' s not a man ' s decision . it be not his body , therefore , he have no right to make the ultimate decision . he can only express his view . that ' s about it .

court : seattle police ok to stun pregnant womanby gene johnson associate press writerseattle - - three seattle police officer be justify when they use a stun gun on a pregnant mother who refuse to sign a traffic ticket , a federal appeal court rule friday in a case that prompt an incredulous dissent . malaika brook be drive her son to seattle ' s african american academy in 2004 when she be stop for do 32 mph in a school zone . she insist it be the car in front of her that be speed , and refuse to sign the ticket because she think she ' d be admit guilt . rather than give her the ticket and let her go on her way , the officer decide to arrest her . one reach in , turn off her car and drop the key on the floor . brook stiffen her arm against the steering wheel and tell the officer she be pregnant , but refuse to get out , even after they threaten to stun her . the officer - sgt . steven daman , officer juan ornelas and officer donald jones - then stun her three time , in the thigh , shoulder and neck , and haul her out of the car , lay her face - down in the street . brook give birth to a healthy baby two month later , but have permanent scar from the taser . she sue the officer for violate her constitutional right , and u.s. district judge richard jones allow the case to continue . he decline to grant the officer immunity for perform their official duty and say brook ' right be clearly violate . but in a 2 - 1 ruling friday , a panel of the 9 th u.s. circuit court of appeal disagree . judge cynthia holcomb hall and diarmuid f . o ' scannlain hold that the officer be justify in make an arrest because brook be obstruct them and resist arrest . the use of force be also justified because of the threat brook pose , hall write : `` it seem clear that brook be not go to be able to harm anyone with her car at a moment ' s notice . nonetheless , some threat she might retrieve the key and drive off erratically remain , particularly give her refusal to leave the car and her state of agitation . `` they also note that the force use wasn ' t that serious because the taser be in `` touch `` mode rather than `` dart `` mode , which hurt more . they reverse the low court ' s opinion and hold that the officer be entitle to immunity from the lawsuit . the officer ' lawyer , ted buck and karen cobb , say the officer make the right decision under the circumstance they face . `` police officer have to have the ability to compel people to obey their lawful order , `` buck say . that ' s all the court recognize today . the 9 th circuit just apply the law instead of get catch up in the otherwise unfortunate factual circumstance . `` the majority ' s opinion outrage judge marsha berzon , who call it `` off the wall . `` `` i fail utterly to comprehend how my colleague be able to conclude that it be objectively reasonable to use any force against brook , let alone three activation of a taser , in response to such a trivial offense , `` she write . she argue that under washington law , the officer have no authority to take brook into custody : failure to sign a traffic infraction be not an arrestable offense , and it ' s not illegal to resist an unlawful arrest . berzon say the majority ' s notion that brook obstructed officer be so far - fetch that even the officer themselves do not make that legal argument . to obstruct an officer , one must obstruct the officer ' s official duty , and the officer ' only duty in this case be to detain brook long enough to identify her , check for warrant , write up the citation and give it to her . brook ' failure to sign do not interfere with those duty , she say . furthermore , brook pose no apparent threat , and the officer could not have know how stunning her would affect the fetus , or whether it might prompt premature labor - another reason their action be inexcusable , berzon say . brook ' lawyer , eric zubel , say he would ask the 9 th circuit to rehear the case . `` this be outrageous - that something like this could happen to a pregnant woman , in front of an elementary school , at 8:30 in the morning , to someone who pose no threat whatsoever , `` he say . for anti - choicers , it ' s just about control and power over woman . they do not care about life . ( except their own . ) this same mother could be a person who do not have access to pre - natal care . they would not defend that right either . because they don ' t care about the fetus . they do not care about life . they do not care about health . they care about power and money and push people around . that ' s all .	0

i be not go to argue with you if he do or do not . you will have to take that up with some of the people in the gay right movement . my point be that many people who have fight for human right claim religion as part of their inspiration , and with your all - or - nothing approach , i can only assume you ' d still condemn religion even if get more and more gay friendly . so i find it odd you ' d even bother to indicate any distinction . i have speak favorably of religious believer who stand up for gay right against a tyrannical version of christianity . what more do you want ? blood ? look , i disagree with the entire concept of religion . my view be that when religious believer support something that ' s right , they do it despite their religion , because it make sense to them on the basis of humanitarian instinct , not religious one . maybe sometimes their religion coincides with humanitarianism . all i can say to that be i wish it would do it more often than it do in practice !	0
this be the old viability arguement , but it just do not hold up . it mean that as our medical technology have get progressively well , and a premature baby can survive outside the womb at early and earlier stage because of this , the point at which it be unethical and / or consider murder have get earlier . there be a point , however , that the fetal lung be not mature enough to survive outside the womb even with mechanical assistance . so , unless our technology will be pretty radically different in the future , it be not about get it out , it ' s about it not survive when it be out .	0
i agree , no oath should be take lightly . however , i believe that a certain amount of interpretation be essential , especially in grey area that medicine can wander into . abortion to save the life of the mother be a grey area that doctor have to wrestle with . separate siamese twin where there be only one heart , allow one to live while the other dy instead of both die be a grey area . follow an oath such as that to the letter put thing too much in black and white , when a lot of good medicine happen in the shade of grey . in the example you give , the doctor be clearly try his * very best to save the most life he can . what if the siamese twin be in no mortal danger while together ? and what if one siamese twin have legs but the other do not ? be not the other twin dependent on the one with leg ? could a doctor ethically remove the legless twin if the legged twin want to and if the legless twin be retard and the procedure would leave the legless twin dead ? * ( or her best . i be sorry but my doctor be male , so i will no longer use `` his / her `` or `` he / she `` . it just get tire after a while . )	0

atheist do , but it do not necessarily mean that they represent science . you have not get in over your head – most who post here do not know much about science . tq do not , and of course he will tell you that i do not . there ' s a big difference between science , and the creation / evolution controversy . many atheist who seem to be interested in science be actually only interested in it to the point that it help them feel “ intellectually fulfil ” , to discredit religion . some of the best reading on the creation / evolution controversy be not write by scientist , but by philosopher who have do just enough scientific homework on the subject to keep a clear focus on the controversy , without confuse it with too much detail . michael ruse and bradley monten be two excellent atheist author on the subject . religious author , practically too many to name . william dembski , david berlinski , phillip johnson , cornelius hunter , many others . you would do well to read anything by any of these people . far too many young people seem to make the mistake of get most all of their information from rabid atheist who be also degreed biologist , like richard dawkins . he ' s become a celebrity , and most degreed biologist who be not rabid atheist be a little to timid to take him on in a very direct way , without fear of discrimination , academic or otherwise . michael behe be one of the few who have be somewhat successful at it , not in avoid discrimination , but in his ability to make a comfortable living in spite of it . read “ the edge of evolution ” , or “ darwin ' s black box ” sometime . happy oh yes , mr behe make a comfortable live out of sell to the ignorant . his new book be just a rehash of his old book , and have the very same flaw that have be destroy over and over again . as for your ' religious author ' be respect . they be respect perhaps by the fundamentalist that do not understand what science be about .	1

my point in start the thread be not merely that christian fall short of their aspiration . no . this be bad . because this particular u.s. senator , an avowed conservative christian , have actively work to restrict the right of others to marry , supposedly in the name of `` protect `` or `` defend `` marriage , while at the same time undermine his own marriage . he make a pretense , for political gain i suspect , of `` defending marriage `` by play to people ' s anti - gay prejudice while himself undermine marriage in his real life . that ' s hypocrisy , and it ' s dishonesty . prove your assertion that he have call himself a conservative christian rather than a conservative republican op . support your clai if you can or stop try to lump everyone on the right together .	0
you be completely wrong and delusional . absolute power corrupts absolutely . fine let just all be on our own , fuck government , fuck state , fuck town , fuck family , let all do what we feel so long as it make us happy . there have to be an order to thing if not there will be chaos , history have prove this time and time again , but if you think that ' s the way to live be my guest , you will not live to long , the universe seek balance and order not chaos . yes power will corrupt this be the reason for the system we have , like family , town , state , government and un to prevent the power hungry from take over , it be up to us to prevent that from happen , we the people be the world not some lone wolf .	1

you make an assertion of fact , and it be therefore your job to establish its veracity with reputable evidence . the argument from ( or `` appeal to `` ) ignorance be a logical fallacy which claim that a premise be true ( `` canadian be come over the border for our health system in hoard , while abandon theirs `` ) only because it have not be proven false . ergo , you lose . aw declare victory and slither off eh . i make an assertof fact that be back up . you make a strawman of abandonment . no one make that claim but you . they come here because they do not get the proceedure in a timely manner . get it now ? hence you lose as usual .	1
so they ( pro - life peep ) say abortion be murder . of course , you can only murder people . so their rule be that fetus ( feti ? ) be people also . but then they can not explain why fetus be not list on the us census , or why there be not a funeral every time a woman have a miscarriage . pretty much , along with the rule of have child , you would have to acquire the birth certificate during conception , you would have to pay tax for child , even if you be only pregnant , etc . or be i miss something ? care to clarify , anybody who disagree ? yes , you be miss something . how come age do not start at conception ? how come when baby be bear they be not 9 month old instead of , well , second old .	0
since reverend hellhound insist on use an antique definition of ' well - regulate ' , i think it will be interesting to examine an antique definition of ' the people ' . the founder define ' the people ' rather narrowly . john adam explain that woman be not part of ' the people ' because ' nature have make them fit for domestic care ' and woman be unfit for ' the great business of life , and the hardy enterprise of war , as well as the arduous care of the state ' . servant and those who do not own land be also not part of the people because they be ' too little acquainted with public affair to form a right judgement , and too dependent upon other men to have a will of their own . ' ( work of adam 9:37 5 - 378 ) what be you talk about ? ! the constitution be write in the late 1700 ' s we have to go by thier meaning not a modern interpretation , this be most silly . as for your quote on adam i do not see how that even remotley applies to this discussion . care to expound ?	1

it be only because we eat too much meat and i have say that before . the point about need animal protien wasn ' t that we be not get enough , but that we do need some of it in our diet to be fully healthy . well that be good that you recognize our society eat too much meat and too much protein . now will you agree with me that you can get all the protein you need from whole wheat bread , oatmeal , bean , corn , pea , mushroom , and broccoli ? now grant some vegetarian eat alot of junk food , and in that case they be not get the right amount of protein . but many vegan like myself dont eat any junk food and follow the recommend food pyramid for vegan . i follow it very strictly and i know beyond any doubt that i be more healthy than the vast majority of american out there .	0

 lol , be you serious ? nobody want to force their `` religiously prescribed morality `` on you . i be agnostic . i do not subscribe to any religion . it be just common sense that murder an unborn human be be wrong . i do not need religion to tell me that . the debate over abortion really have nothing to do with religion . common sense ? a collection of human cell as yet not develop enough to have even the potential for consciousness a human be ? uncommon sense imo . just the use of the term `` unborn `` be ridiculous . be the rest of us the `` undead `` ?	0

common sense . the number of live specie that have escape our attention can not compare to those that have go extinct over several billion year of life with numerous mass extinction , remember that fossil be rare . surely , we can only ' guesstimate ' how many living specie have escape our attention ? but how probable be it that only 1 % of all the specie that ever exist escaped extinction ? i think your point about mass extinction may be a key to what have puzzle me .	0

for this to be a consistent pro - choice argument , and assume this to be a rightful interpretation and application of the 1 4 th amendment there would be necessary conclusion . those who hold this as an absolute belief must extend the right of a woman ' s right to choose the allocation of her bodily resource beyond pregnancy and into every instance of life . therefore the pro - choice line of reason that say that a woman have the right to choose to abort because she do not wish do share her bodily resource can be extend to conclude also that a newborn infant can be abort if a woman decide not to donate her bodily resource of nutrition and she have no access to formula ( no other factor involve ) . that be an erroneous line of reasoning because it fail to take into account the myriad of other option open to a woman after birth to remove the newborn from her care without any ill effect ( physically anyway ) . kill in the instance of a newborn be not justified because of those other option open to her . by contrast , a pregnant woman have exactly one option open to her to remove the fetus from her care and that be abortion . i would contend that the same line of reason that allow for adoption can be use here , that no one must donate their resource to a dependant . your reason that a woman , use the same line of reason that pro - choice people employ , can withhold her bodily resource `` until the newborn die `` as if that be equal to withhold bodily resource in pregnancy be faulty .	0

i have read the opinion and conclusion reach in several internet entry and i can see how they would largely persuade someone to think that the side - by - side dinosaur and human print in stone do not exist . however , before you reach a personal conclusion , i would really recommend you visit the site . awe be not strong enough to describe the feeling that overcome you when you personally witness this . i have be there and felt the chill when i saw what could only be print of very old human co - exist with dinosaur . there be hardly a rebuttal that work when one be personally expose to such an odd and even eerie site . the heel mark be clear as be the arch and in many instance , the toe . before the naysayer offer a rebuttal , i think a visit to the paluxy river around glenrose might be in order . when you do , i think you will agree that there really be nothing like it . you might even revise your opinion regard order and origin of life . sound pretty neat . i have never be there but i will keep it in mind for a road trip some time . so you be of the belief that dinosaur and man live at the same time ? i know that there be people who believe in this but i do not come across them very often . so what information do you have to share with us about this idea ?	0

this be wrong . you yourself find `` mental existence `` to be `` sacred ' in a way . there be no rational argument for mental existence be the point of obtain right . no matter how hard any of us try tong we be legally dead when we no longer mentally exist ( hence the term `` brain - dead `` ) , so there be no logical reason to set the beginning point as anything other than the start of the mental existence . just as people who be dead and without mental existence do not have the ability to obtain right , a collection of human cell without a mental existence can not obtain right . i also notice you have resort to attack other people ' s view rather than follow the topic of the thread , which be to share your view . emoticonxbanghead	0

( you do know what i be talk about , do not you calli ? you do know what a `` point mutation `` be , do not you ? ) bottom line be that there may be no intermediate between scale and feather . a single point mutation produce feather from scale . various kind of feather require only further mutation .	1
what you mean be that we should pretend that creationism have some sort of legitimate basis in reality ? the definition be accurate . it would be different if someone could actually offer a scientific theory of creation . how about some evidence to support the `` theory . `` by the way , i be still wait for you to tell us about how the definition of evolution have change . what you really mean be the creationists have invent bogus definition so that they could lump all of science under `` evolution , `` wasn ' t it ? wow . you be bent on harp on creationists argument at whatever the cost . first of all , you be not even consider that the majority of people be misinform of what evolution be not because they have creationist motif , but because they go to the dictionary for definition	0
be global warm a real threat or be it just a hoax ? i agree it ' s a threat to us but the point be whether it ' s really cause by increaing amount of carbon dioxide and how big the threat be . maybe global warming be just a part of process of global climate change which occur several time long time ago , ie , ice age thing like that . as far as i know , global warming be one of the catastrophe which lead to extinction of human being . however , there might be another problem which be also big threat to us and all creature on the earth . anyway , i be not an expert of environment , so i might be wrong but at least i can say it seem there be some bad effetcts of global warming such as rise sea level , abnormal climate pattern , thing like that . we should do something , which might not be appropriate way to solve the problem but it ' s surely the beginning .	0

lol . this entire argument be so inane . it ' s entirely base on the assumption that the bible be true . obviously that be the fallacy of beg the question . the bible as a whole be unverifiable , and for all we know be write back in the day by a guy who overdose on opium . the idea of rapture be completely irrevelant until the bible be verify as fact . the argument have nothing to do with whether the bible be true or not , and everything to do with how certain concept and interpretation be deduce from read a piece of literature . i be not argue that i believe in a rapture , but rather that there be biblical support for a rapture event . i hope you see the difference	0

well , it seem that even the simple of message fail to penetrate some thick ( sick ) skull : without gun you can not shoot and kill anybody . civilize remove all gun from circulation and do their utmost to also make gu unavailable to criminal and it work . only insecure , paranoid people with and inferiority complex need gun as a security blanket . grow up ! yeah , like the guy run from classroom to classroom kill at will . you think ban gun will prevent criminal from get them ? i be go to say that you live in your own little world , but then i realize the sad reality be that you be in this world steal my oxygen . what ? either try that again , or find someone who can translate . i kinda thought that the insecure , paranoid people be the one who be afraid to step up and take responsibility for their own safety and security . i do not need to carry a gun , i could just roll over and die like so many others when face with an assailant intent on kill me . i choose however to take responsibility for my safety and security , and as such , want to carry a gun . there be a difference .	1

and it ' s so bleedin ' unnecessary , too ! why not just create the universe as it be ? and just let the light take it ' s sweet time to get here ? imagine what proof for creationism that would be : we can only see star out to 6000 light year or so ; look at old star chart we realize that people 1000 year ago could only see star out to 5000 light year ; and as time go by additional star appear in the sky as the light from them finally reach us . if god do create the universe only 6000 year ago , the fact that we can see the entire universe now can only count as a deliberate , i will repeat , a deliberate , oh how i love that word , deliberate deception on the part of the creator . deliberate deception would be put million year old dinosaur bone on a thousand year old planet . even more deceiving would be put vast amount of oil here as well which take million of year to create . i would put the star in the sky in the same category as this in term of deception . the star could be more of a cosmetic thing as far as god be concern . he could have just add them to our sky without concern for whether it make sense or not . i personally would not fault him for this .	1

god have two choice . he could make creature that obey him completely with no possibility whatsoever of choose against his will . or he could make free creature with the choice to love god or not . can you imagine an interesting world where there be no choice ? can there be love without choice ? can robots love ? because adam and eve chose to disobey god they be no long perfect . all of history since then have be god ' s plan to bring us back to perfection . this be the view many christian have , hope it help you . only two choice ? poor god , infinity reduce to black or white .	1
second , in this very thread arch have deliberately tie the two as one . there be at least three post here where he have just do that . you will notice right off the bat , despite a distinct clarification of yec , and not christanity as a whole , that arch deliberately take the discussion on yec as a discussion on christanity . notice that the only person who argue the thread from a christanity as a whole view be arch . the rest of us deliberately state otherwise . so what you be say be that by mention both in the same post , i be say that unless someone be a yec then they be not a christian ? because that be what you attribute to me . yet you have yet to post evidence of me say that to anyone . nor have you support your original claim here , you say this : last i check , no credible fossil fuel firm hire yec geologist . prove this assertion since you research it thoroughly enough to start a thread about .	1
quite so . i be have great difficulty understand why you think your opinion should be make law in the universe ? have you ever for a moment stop to think that perhaps you could be wrong ? of course i know that i could be wrong but i would have to be prove wrong through rational arguement , not just claim . have you ever stop to think that perhaps you could be wrong ? either way , we already discuss this issue of whether people can have opinion about abortion law . perhaps you be have a ' senior moment ' and do not remember our discussion . i really do not feel like repeat this whole discussion all over again for your benefit . indeed , you do seem to repeat your question quite often . if you do not like someone ' s answer , do not just repeat the question - address their answer . if you do not remember our discussion , it start pretty much around post 861 . unless you have something new to say that we do not already discuss , then i think we pretty much cover it and leave it at a disagreement .	0

( maybe day ) i see you be watch , and do not want you think this will be develop quickly . i will let you know when i have conclude . - - chuz * * * note to ian . in my attempt to compile my ' summary ' i have realize that i never actually complete my argument . it ' s kind of hard to summarize that which have not already be present . so , my sumarization if you will - will now consist of two part . first my argument and then my summary . work in progress ; the argument biologically speak , a human individual ' s life begin at conception definition ; a begin be biologically child conception egg embryo fetus gamete human individual life metamorphosisorganism sperm zygote - dictionary . com a begin be biologically child conception egg embryo fetus gamete human individual life metamorphosis organism sperm zygote - - free dictionary . com child due process clause person - - findlaw . com link logic a distinct human organism american college of pediatrician the human organism when do a human individual ' s life begin the physiology of age human growth and age wikipedia ; life when do life begin ? quote ; sperm ; ' during fertilization , the nucleus of a sperm fuse with the nucleus of the much large egg cell ( the female reproductive cell ) to form a new organism ' . - the american heritage : register : science dictionary barack hussein obama ; ' we need father to recognize their responsibility doesn ’ t just end at conception .

' and ' when do the soul enter the body so that to terminate the living organism amount to kill a person ? that be the question . ' chuz , the purpose of this summary be not to summarise your argument as a whole - it be to summarise what your argument be up to this point . why not post just a summary of your position so far , as you see it - i can do the same , then you can continue with your argument ? there ' s no point in write an argument , summarise it and then leave the thread before i have have a chance to respond to even your argument ( never mind your summary ) . if you be go to simply ignore any criticism of your reasoning , then i struggle to see the point of you repeatedly request a one - on - one debate in the first place - you essentially regress your argument to the ' because i say so ' that you be ( presumably ) hop to avoid , it ' s just that there ' s slightly more detail .	0
for a 13 year old girl that could greatly damage her body to have a pregnancy so young . she be just start to grow and mature , and its not healthy , natural , or right to have a pregnancy at that age . she could cause alot of damage be that young . wf , that be true and if the young lady life be endanger then to terminate the pregnancy would be appropriate but get a neutral doctor to make that decision , not one from plan parenthood or and abortion clinic who have a bias interest in perform abortion . that be all i ask . 	0

if all life evolve from a common ancestor , then there should be countless instance of new body part evolve . body part such as eye , muscle , bone , etc . we have not see one instance of a new body part evolve in a population in which it have not exist previously . evolutionist will wave the magic `` time wand `` and simply claim that such a change could never be observe in a few decade . what about fruit fly ? one generation of fruit fly = around a day . fruit fly be expose to x ray to speed up mutation rate , we have observe the equivalent of million of year ( in term of human generation ) of super - accelerate mutation and . no new body part . evolutionist will also list in step how a new body part can arise . this be only plausible if each of those step could be directly observe . if not , then it be nothing more than science fiction . evolutionist have be search for any direct evidence of the theory of evolution since the 1800 ' s . they be still look . you have ask a good question cash , the way you know that be by all of the excuse you be get rather than any attempt to actually answer you directly with solid evidence . of course we know that evidence do not exist , but they will never admit that either . emoticonxgood	0

‘ the philosophy of experimental science … begin its discovery and make use of its method in the faith , not the knowledge , that it be deal with a rational universe control by a creator who do not act upon whim nor interfere with the force he have set in operation … it be surely one of the curious paradox of history that science , which professionally have little to do with faith , owe its origin to an act of faith that the universe can be rationally interpret , and that science today be sustain by that assumption . ' origin of science , whether truly start by those of faith or not , be irrelevant . whatever science be , it have become a body of knowledge , through application of reason .	0

i be really not so sure about obama ' s healthcare plan , when i read it it seem kind of wishy - washy . # like what do `` reform the insurance market to increase competition by take on anticompetitive activity that drive up price without improve quality of care . `` actually mean ? # in practice ? # i be more interested in the health care for america plan more , it ' s a proposal put together by the political scientist jacob hacker with the support of the economic policy institute . i ' d suggest read think big to get a good idea of the plan , but the basic idea be that employer pay money into a public fund , enough to cover their worker . # the public fund should have quality coverage for all , include preventive care . # worker get to choose - keep your insurance , choose a different private plan , or join a public health insurance plan without a private insurer middleman , pick your healthcare provider and doctor . # employer choose too . those who prefer not to shoulder the burden of provide coverage as good as the law require can decide to enroll their worker in the public plan at a modest cost . # hcfa and medicare would function as a single nationwide insurance pool cover close to half the population . so basically either the public plan attract most american , and our system gradually evolve into single - payer or because the floor prevent a race to the bottom , the public - private competition raise the bar on care and efficiency , improve quality and cutting cost , even in the private insurance plan . # the standard would be keep by a strong government watchdog . # what do you think ? i think you be on to something . the problem i see be that any proponent of a plan such as this will have toi take on both the health insurance lobby and the pharma lobby and their bottomless well of $ $ $ and propaganda . here ' s hop now that there ' s a new sheriff in town .	0

you might criticize me for believe evolution happen simply because scientist say it do , but ala , thats the reason why . anyway . no . unless you wish to actually undertake the study of the relevant science , that ' s what you need to do . creationists do the same thing . the problem be that creationists tend to accept the word of those who be not any more educate than they be . thus , a creationist will accept hovind ' s dust on the moon argument or his shrink sun argument as `` proof `` of a young earth .	0

you mention pursue fact ? i do not see how that ' s possible . for now assume that god create the earth and the science commnity accept that . what specific experimentation would you do ? what would you investigate that you feel could further the human pool of knowledge ? how about some specific ? as i mention above , science curriculum follow path . one ' s worldview play heavily on one ' s interpretation of scientific data . an agnostic , or atheist teach establishment can become satisfied with one path of scientific theory without search for others . there may be more to be discover about thermodynamics , cell structure , irreducible complexity , the decay rate of the earth ' s magnetic field , radiometric dating , the fossil record , and countless other thing that a teaching establishment may not be interested in explore , if it ' s comfortable with it ' s interpretation of current data ' s indication that the happenstance origins worldview be correct . it go back to what we touch on before - teaching student how to think , not what to think .	0
5 ) move on , if we look teh other way , evolution be actually a theory not physically proven , one of it s theory suggest that human start out in africa while another in asia , but if u look at them none resemble the other and none have a characteristic of an animal . and of course , the theory of gravity be not `` physically `` proven either . neither be the heliocentric theory or atomic theory or the germ theory of disease . however , evolution have be observe to occur and the current theory be the best explanation that we have for the observation . as far as your mangling of the `` out of africa `` theory , it would be nice if you actually learn what you be talk about before you babble such nonsense .	1

hm . to me that sound frighteningly similar to something that could be hear several decade ago : ' our school should only teach white child . we do not hate gay or anything , we just oppose have them in school with our child , it just be not possible to us to allow them in our school . we be not really oppose to them go to school , we will support that as long as they go to their own school for black and be not allow in our white school . allow them in the white school be just silly . ' i be sorry , but just like what be decide back then , seperate but equal be never equal . basically they be say that gay be somehow inferior and have to be put in their own instisution l they sully the institution of marriage ( something heteros be do without anyone else ' s help ) . separate but equal be never equal ? which be good ? boy ' or girl ' bathroom ? other than that last statement i agree 100 % . i do not believe gay civil union be separate but equal but i do believe they could be if we want them to be . unfortunately the people who seem to only be against redefine marriage and for civil union never want to give gay all the right of marriage in a civil union .	0

very nice propaganda , siegfriedson . why do not you tell us about the terrorist activity that necessitate military activity that inevitably cause also civilian death . the shooting of the 13 - year - old girl be a terrible exception and i think the officer should be severely punished ( i think he be ) . the point be that israel try to avoid civilian casualty whenever it be possible , hamas and other terrorist target civilian on purpose . here be the reason for anti - terror operation in the west bank and gaza : list of victim since september 2000 suicide attack just since january 2004 ( do not include mortar and rocket attack that happen on almost a daily basis ) : tel - aviv feb 25 2005 karni cross jan 13 2005 tel - aviv nov 1 2004 sinai ( taba hilton ) oct 10 2004 beersheba aug 31 2004 ashdod march 14 jerusalem feb 22 2004 jerusalem jan 29 2004 i love how hamas apologist require show idf abuse to defend their action . pathetic .	0
from an enviromental perspective , forest fire be crucial for certain specie to survive . man make influence have create a situation where forest fire be too uncommon that certain specie and plant be face extinction . forest fire also serve the purpose of revitalise the forest and make them more ' healthy ' . but as i say , this be from the enviromental point of view . you be indeed correct that uncontralable forest fire be hazardous for human who live nearby ( as well as property ) . as always , a trade - off must be make . i be not really surprise at the bush administration lack of a forest management plan . he know for not be an enviromentally - friendly president . forest fire be usually a natural occurance . they be often good for the eco - system . it ' s the man make disaster that be the problem . we can not stop forest fire , but we can keep the property damage to a minimum by thin forest , build access road where posible to fight the fire , and have strict control over timber harvest . often the timber company over - cut certain area , leave the lanscape a barren , lifeless terrain , not suit for wildlife habitat . soil erosion can become a problem also , as the silt from the soil erosion pollute the stream and damage the fish habitat . the government need a good forest management plan for public land , and more funding for personel to impliment the current program of forest management .	0

often abortion supporter convey their message as one of champion the cause of freedom of choice and resistance of the oppression of others value on woman . perhaps this should be post as a poll but i wonder if this support for `` choice `` remain consistent . do those who support the choice of abortion also support the choice to bear child ? do they abhor the imposition of the one child rule on the woman of china for example ? the woman ' s choice be restrict and the ideal of the government be impose upon her . do those here who support the freedom of choice of abortion denounce china ' s policy and support the freedom of choice of bear child ? there be also some area in india where a person run for an elected office can not have more than two child ( there be obvious implication of this policy on what the makeup of the rule government will be and how it will institute policy ) . do those support the choice of abortion denounce this policy as a restriction of choice ? or do environmental and population concern outweigh and assume more importance than the freedom of choice in the above example ? well , i can not speak for anyone else , but i support any choice that the woman want to make . no , i do not support forced abortion anywhere , i do not support what ' s go on in china and india because they be still take a choice away from the woman . what i do not get be that many prolifers think that prochoicers be only for the choice of abortion . all the prochoicers i know support any choice the woman feel right about make . for example , i be call a hypocrite because i be prochoice and pregnant . the person say `` you be force others to abort while you carry to term . `` i have never force anyone to do anything , nor will i ever . i have also never abort . and many prolifers automatically assume that if one be prochoice they have abort .	0

one of the big argument against gun control be that if the government become too oppressive , the people would not have the capacity to carry out a successful rebellion . of course , if the government be become oppressive , it would likely implement gun control , so the absence of gun control be necessary to ensure that we do not take a plunge towards fascism ! not quite . to be more correct regard government and gun , the right to own weapon be for the right to revolt and revolt with violence . our political philosophy be very clear on this : `` that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these end , it be the right of the people to alter or to abolish it `` - declearation of independaceyou have the right to try and revolt with violence . you do not have the right to win a revolt .	0

guidance by human in the blind watchmaker do not stop it be a reasonable analogy for his idea that no high intelligence be in evolution but it can produce . in the analogy the guidance by human represent natural selection . you could represent the rule of natural selection as set of equation with random element that contain no human ingenuity instead but i do not see it as a crime to use a human force to act under restriction to represent that have nothing to do with human . i will show youyou could describe electron as thing that hate other electron but like positive charge . if some electron see other electron come at them down a wire they will also move down the wire to avoid them . if it mean go through a circuit an power a light globe to do the electron will still flow if the circuit be complete . now let think about whats happen , each indivual electron hate large group of electron come towards it but to get out of the way it will have to get close to other electron ( those punk ) . so if you increase the cross sectional area of the wire then the resistance will decrease . what about a double adaptor ? all it do be let the current go through two different circuit . now if there be two light globe will they both glow half as bright ? no . why because the resistance be halve and there will be twice as much total electron flow . a lot of law in electric circuit theory make sense to me when i imagine i be an electron go through a wire and how happy i would be go down a wire . electron be not happy but i still have an analogy that give me answer so i be happy . i would have be good off be tell that voltage be joule per coloumb so the voltage drop between circuit must be the same . again , it ' s not the point . there be many who do not deny evolution , they believe it be guide . show example of guidence - through artificial selection support this theory	0

which be why it should be do on a case - by - case basis . sometimes there can be an age gap of 5 year and it could still be consensual , so imo fine , but other time it could be 4 year age difference and not fine ( eg , a 14 year old and a ten year old ) i be not really sure how that analogy be relevant . - wez your right about the 14 year old and the ten year old but if it be a 18 and 14 should that be legal ? or 18 and 15 ? 16 and 21 be legal ( although it be wrong ) because the young one be still legal . age of consent = 16 year old . if your base it on a year gap what about 10 year ? i be 10 year old than my fiance . before anyone jump to conclusion i be 38 . and she be 28 . legal ? why ? we be both over 16 . period .	0

( 6 ) natural selection supposedly account for the development of new kind , but actually tend to preserve the present kind , since an incipient organ or new feature of any kind would have no `` survival `` value unless it be fully functional from its very begin . actually , natural selection tend to preserve a specie with only minor change in a stable environment . but environment tend to change . i do not know what that `` incipient organ `` junk be suppose to mean . be that another way of say `` what good be half a wing . `` well , check out a penguin to find out . look at a seal flipper . it have the same bone , arrange in the same way as a monkey . what good be it for a land animal ? and what do `` fully functional `` mean ? what function ? perhaps the new organ have a different purpose - take the clawed hand of fossil bird for example . they be good for catch prey and climbing , just like they be for their dinosaur ancestor . but those clawed wing also allow early bird to fly .	0

it be not the existence of the gay people that moralize family question . their opposition to them be in the video be not base on that . their view be that it should not be consider a ' family ' in the acceptable sense of the term . not that they exist . surely you know this . now , you and i do not agree with that , but the question here be whether or not the school should teach about issue that moralistic one in people ' mind , such as this one . imo , they should not . there be a broad issue here . so you think censor over the issue be a moralistic one be ridicuous , eh ? so you ' d have no problem with school teach that people should go to church ? or that male kid can have more than one wife at a time when they grow up ? those too be moralistic - base issue to many people . so basically , what you be advocate here be that public school should teach no moral value whatever . they should not teach tolerance , because that offend the intolerant ; they should not teach racial equality , because that offend racist ; they should not teach religious freedom , because that offend religious bigot . maybe they should not teach the immorality of theft and murder because that offend thief and murderer . i be truly surprised to hear a right - winger such as your good self advocate that public school should promote a moral vacuum . but then , i suppose anything be good than teach acceptance of gay family as just another sort of family among the many that exist today .	1

their belief be fanciful . we might as well give credence to murray the mystical eeel as have create the earth and the universe . it ' s unparsimonious . you do not need absolute proof for something to be valid . there be no credible proof for creationism , and evolution be the only other viable , parsimonious explanation . just because you do not hold the same belief as we do , do not invalidate our belief . i feel sorry for you if all you have to believe in be a small petri dish of algae . you do need absolute proof if your go claim it as the only possible way of creation .	1

it begin to look , then , that this be a piece of crude propaganda ( see note below ) , deliberately manipulate to give the false impression that the fact of evolution be seriously under scientific question , and that the fanciful notion of creation ` scientist ' be contribute to that debate . well then , my skeptic fellow australian , what be the answer to the question ? do any of you guy here know ? i sure as hell do not . creationists do not misquote dawkins because the word come from his mouth . and dawkins be a professional at biology , but he could not answer such a question . in the little amount of fossil that we do see , they be not evolutionary . there be no clear cut fossil show the evolution of man , be there . by `` true human `` i mean they be just like us , just varients of human kind that we have today - look human , walk like us , most likely be quite intelligent . i have get to go to school , continue this later .	0

`` although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the second amendment , nothing in our opinion should be take to cast doubt on longstanding prohibition on the possession of firearm by felon and the mentally ill , or law forbid the carrying of firearm in sensitive place such as school and government building , or law impose condition and qualification on the commercial sale of arm . `` - us supreme court in d.c. v . hellerso the us supreme court recognize that some restriction be reasonable such as not allow felon to own gun or prohibit people from carry gun in school area . so how be those gun free zone work out for you ?	1
we be legally dead when we no longer mentally exist ( hence the term `` brain - dead `` ) , so there be no logical reason to set the beginning point as anything other than the start of the mental existence . just as people who be dead and without mental existence do not have the ability to obtain right , a collection of human cell without a mental existence can not obtain right . this assume brain - dead be a logical choice to consider one dead . even so , it prove nothing about when life begin . what say they have to be the same ? this be a classic example of a conclusion not follow from the premise .	0

i doubt it . a story on the news today . those who have firearm in their home be more likely to die of murder and be more likely to die from suicide . interesting . sucide ? be not that a mental health issue ? if you take a gun from a sucidal and depressed person , do that cure depression ? if it do that you have address the root cause of sucide . if it do not than you really have not do anything to cure the fundamental cause of sucide .	0
what i really find disturbing be why you choose to ignore truth and fact . do you know that the black that be bring here from africa be the criminal and the mentally derange ? 90 % of black here today be a product of them . think about that for a week . have you listen to `` gangsta rap `` lately ? it be the decay of the 9 0 s . of society . but they keep get rich ! that be an interesting fact , how come i have never hear such a thing . maybe a link be in order and not a stormfront or the like link please . actually i have listen to gangsta rap . easy e , snoop , nwa , and so many others , in fact they be in my truck right now . imagine a redhead `` whitey `` take enjoyment in listen to all kind of music . hmm i also have lady smith black mambazo , nat king cole , and while we be at it i have music that i adore from iran , iraq , saudi , turkey and so many i cant list them all . whats your point ? i would hardly call rap the decay of the 90 ' s , apparently a lot of people listen if they be make money . i wonder if you have a crazy relative somewhere in your past ? maybe that would explain a lot .	1
blah , blah , blah be right . thanks for the meaningless tripe . i realize you want to believe that evolution be fact but you yourself admit it ' s only a theory and a false and fraudulent one at that . you evos repeat the same incoherent wishful thinking as you contradict yourselves from one example to the next . people who can believe such inconsistency in science must truly prefer ignorance to enlightenment . so enjoy your ignorance but do not expect me to stop ask the question that expose how unreasonable and impossible this fraudulent science be . and would not it be great that rather than give the same old can response that be base in the same old false assumption , and the mocking insult toward me , that your side actually deal with the question ask . only them , with objective and serious consideration will you evos realize how you have be dupe by scientific gibberish and pseudo intellectual psycho babble that lead very simple people into think that with such big word and so scientific a vocabulary , the lie of evo must be at least base in truth . i submit to you that nothing could be far from the truth . talk about incoherent wishful thinking . instead of unsubstantiated claim and baseless attack , why do not you provide , oh , i do not know , mybe some peer - review evidence ? you know , that little old thing that be require for anyone to take your wild claim even remotely seriously ?	1

consider that there ' s little new information and reasoning in any of these debate , i find it surprise that they keep come up . i be not surprised . we be live in an age when communication outside of our local group be become increasingly common . people be start to hear idea they never would have before . religion have generally survive because people ' s experience be limit to the view of those immediately around them , those who pretty much share those same view . today , and for a while now , that ' s be change and people be hear other thing cause them to rethink what they have be teach .	0

the militia of the second amendment be a militia that be describe as be well regulate ( regulate by both the federal government and the state as spoken of in article 1 of the constitution ) . in our own day , i think the national guard would be the only militia that qualify as be well regulate . alexander hamilton spoke of the desirability of the militia be well regulate : `` it require no skill in the science of war to discern that uniformity in the organization and discipline of the militia would be attend with the most beneficial effect , whenever they be call into service for the public defense . it would enable them to discharge the duty of the camp and of the field with mutual intelligence and concert an advantage of peculiar moment in the operation of an army ; and it would fit them much sooner to acquire the degree of proficiency in military function which would be essential to their usefulness . this desirable uniformity can only be accomplish by confide the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority . it be , therefore , with the most evident propriety , that the plan of the convention propose to empower the union `` to provide for organize , arm , and discipline the militia , and for govern such part of them as may be employ in the service of the united state , reserve to the state respectively the appointment of the officer , and the authority of train the militia accord to the discipline prescribe by congress . `` the federalist paper - thomas ( library of congress ) we could go back to the day when most citizen be require to enroll in the militia , have gun and get military training - to what the founder really mean when they speak of a well regulate militia be the security of a free state . but the supreme court along with pro - gun activist claim to be pro - second amendment have decide to turn their back on that part of the second amendment while give the lip service to the idea of a militia . well regulate as in the second amendment do not mean regulate by the government , it mean well equip and prepare . the framer of the constitution often speak of a tyrannical government and how to keep one from come to power , so why in the hell would they have say let just give the government total control of gun . your definition of well regulate make about as much sense as add another day to the week .	0
by far most speech about homosexuality from those who do not approve be not hate speech . you have be listen to too much propaganda from gay lobby group who think demonize and work toward persecute christian for their belief be the best mean to an end . if canada limit it ' s persecution only to those who be try to change the law , there would not be a problem . you misunderstand me i believe they should all be lock up . anyone who preach against gay people freely live their life as equal citizen with all the right and responsibilites should be lock up in the dark dungeon . there can be no compromise on this issue people life be at stake .	0

dude you need to realize this : if the claim i make be true , which i believe they be , then that mean all the most crazy , outlandish , extreme conspiracy , be true . this be why society would have such a hard time believe it be real . not because they dont want to travel interdimensionally , but because it would mean believing in what those ' crazy nutjobs ' believe in , do you realize this ? all conspiracy be tie in to hide this one fact . conspiracy theorists never look that far back , but when you start look that far back , it make alot more sense . this have nothing to do with my post . you do not need to believe in conspiracy theory to believe that the universe be pretty crazy . i be an advocate of science , and even i admit that , especially at the quantum level , shit get crazy . particle be in two place at once , 95 % of the universe be undetectable , whole separate universe collide to make new one . it ' s crazy yes , but it be also scientific . in fact , compare to science , the answer psychic provide be rather boring . i be impress by the stuff i just list , not some charlatan guess whether or not i have a dog .	0
the quality of life ethic be far different from sactity / dignity of life ethic . a quality of life ethic carry out to its logical conclusion do not promote a pro - life society . instead , there would be genocide against the handicapped , elderly , and people who people of power have deem life unworthy of life . the problem with this ethic be that it be center in arbritrary people decide arbritarily which person pass the `` quality of life `` test . the interesting thing about the ' quality of life ethic ' be that , in a pro - choice framework , it mean that we can not degrade anyone ' s quality of life without their permission . so far from entail a cull of the elderly , the infirm , the handicapped , and the ugly , the quality of life ethic entail that we can not kill them off . each person be entitle to the quality of life that they desire where what they desire do not infringe on other ' s quality of life .	0
marriage be between a man and a woman . if we allow marriage to be redefine to include same - sex couple , the twin pillars of morality and spirituality ( which have serve as beacon of the american culture since our begin ) will not stand . and those pillar will be replace by something strong like equality and justice .	0
so what ? a person have a right to defend themselves , as spell out in the constitution . or would you rather the 80 year old just get beaten to death for his $ 262 ? or maybe you ' d feel well if he ' d suffer the same fate as the home invader over in maryland . he make the mistake of break and enter into a student house and be slaughter with a sword . and what point be you try to make anyway ? it ' s not like the 80 year old go on a killing spree of anything . nobody get murder . so what be you moan about ? people keep say thats the law in texas , so im say that this be the law in new york , he break the law so he have it come , next time dont disrespect the law and get a license , im just show how some of the people on this board be major hypocrite , you suddenly get all soft on crime when you dont like the law ,	0

first great post i have see in awhile with the truth attach ! his own drummer all right . you might say that the ot god have a bit of a problem upstairs . funny you should mention lot ' s wife . lot ' s family be the sole survivor of the destruction of an entire city , for reason which be debate . lot ' s wife be turn into a pillar of salt just because she look backwards as she be leave - a natural human response . gen . 19:26 clearly state that she be behind lot . therefore in order to find out what happen to his wife , would not he also have to have look back ? so , anyway , turn around get you turn into a pillar of salt , but incest be a ok ! it must be scary believe in such an inconsistant and crazy god . 	1

i would love to see the evidence for that . ala , there be none . i think there one italian archelogist who claim he find some drawing that he believe that the ' mount sinia ' mention be different than generally accept , but i be skeptical of his claim . there be enough screwball and religious nut pretend to be archelogists in israel that it take more than a concensus of 1 for me to consider something . this guy do seem to be more educated than the vendyl jones crowd in archeology , but still a bit on the fringe . maybe he will get more attention , and provide a good set of evidence , because it be the people on the fringe that be need to shift the paradiam .

they be not relate , as far as i be aware . the evidence on global warming , however , be pretty overwhelm . i think this be a bad way to put it . the evidence that they earth have be warm since we have have the ability to measure temperature be overwhelming . the cause be unknown and whether or not it be natural be unknown . it do seem fairly narasistic to think in 100 year we have cause so much damage to an earth that at least have be here 10,000 year .	0
you can not mandate biology . the fact of the matter be , however , that homosexual relationship , themselves , appear to have no positive evolutionary purpose . without effect on the female line , this aberration ( for lack of a good word ) would have breed itself out of the population long ago . it would be similar to a subset of the population in an animal specie suddenly be attract to another , separate animal specie . it would seem to serve no positive purpose . procreation be a positive , useful purpose to any activity in an evolutionary context . sexual attraction exist to facilitate procreation . pleasure during sex exists to facilitate procreation . homosexual individual have brain that co - opt specific biological function to substitute creature that do not facilitate the purpose they evolve to involve . human do not just have sex for procreation . human have sex for pleasure . that explain the evolution of the clitoris and the bundle of nerve underneath the head of the penis .	0

indeed . many people do not realize that the commandment be not `` thou shalt not kill , `` but `` thou shalt not murder . `` the important question then become , when be kill murder ? i have no doubt that god care for the life of fetus . but i also have no doubt that god care for the life of pregnant woman . the reason i bring up the exodus passage be that it ' s often take to establish that abortion be murder , and that perform an abortion should be punish accordingly . but the passage be not talk about abortion at all . which just leave us with the question of when it be or be not acceptable to take a life , and the passage do not provide guidance to that general question , either . how be that conclusion derive at ? the passage be speak to the consequence to a man who ' s action cause the death of an unborn child . and the proscribed consequence be death accord to ot law . so although the passage be not speak to abortion at all , it be make a very clear statement regard the value of the unborn , as it be require a life for a life just as for any other sentient be accord to the ot law . so these argument i get from the like of you and iangb which argue that until a child show mental awareness , it be not actually a person deserving of human right be a bogus and shortsighted position accord to the scriptural point of view . of that , there be no question .	0
obvious strawman argument . i wasn ' t argue that the federalist paper be part of the constitution . hamilton be actually argue in favor of what article 1 of the constitution say about the militia in that quote . so the quote do not contradict the constitution . i see you miss the entire point of my post . good job on analyze the sarcastic opening though .	1

it be not a rational alternative to the theory of evolution , unless you can somehow show that you be not rely on the unknowable . but we also do not know that evolution be true - it be a belief system about the past that require faith for it to have any reason . your first part be already false ( prove above ) .	0
i read it the first time . your be try to argue that your experience be somehow unique and the way it happen excludes you from those who do what everyone else be do . there be absolutely nothing in your personal story that be remarkable in anyway . as i say before just because you don ’ t realize it doesn ’ t mean that it be not influence you to do what everyone else be do . it happen to everyone include stupid arrogant people with an i ’ m special attitude . your thinking be so screw up that it preclude from know that . you really think your something special but you ’ re not your just another brain dead clone . where do you get off say that kind of tripe to somebody ? that kind of insane comment be typical of far left loon like you who lie for a living and do not have the common sense of a fence post . and that go for jo bennett too if he ' s agree with you . cretin .	1

well its not . be not you more concerned about those people that have a abortion after unprotected sex ? no i be not . to me it do not matter how the fetus get there , and seriously , why be it relevant for you to know that ? what result ? describe to me the result and we will see if its the same . well . with condom . you have no baby . and with abortion , you do not have any baby either . no i be not . well you certainly should be . to me it do not matter how the fetus get there , and seriously , why be it relevant for you to know that ? wow . i ' d say i be surprise but i be really not . so you be say that people who do not want a baby stupid enough to have unprotected sex be on an equal playing field with those who properly apply protection which fail ? that ' s ludicrous and you really should know good . well . with condom . you have no baby . and with abortion , you do not have any baby either . you leave out a few important detail there buddy . with the killing of a 3 - month old with an axe you have no baby . but its the same result ! yippee !	1
it be an absract concept , but i draw attention to the fact that no man can speak on this issue with the perspective that a woman can by virtue of the fact they can never be pregnant . so i suggest that it be very easy to say something be wrong when you can not appreciate the fullness of the issue - a man will never be place in the situation where they will be pregnant but do not wish to have a baby at that point . by your logic , do i have to be a murder to understand that murder be wrong ? this ' walk a mile in my sandal ' stuff be just bs . i do not have to be a woman to view abortion as not be moral .	1
there be no criminal penalty for private individual and organization violate the constitutional right of other private individual . your backpack and person may be search without a warrant if they have reason to suspect you of have steal something . as there be no penalty that mean there be no crime have be commit . the civil right act of 1964 be another matter of discussion entirely . unfortunately until low court case build precedent to show that firearms ownership be a civil right and will be treat as such there be nothing that can be do when private individual choose to prohibit firearm on say property . a cop try that in school and get sue and lose , a private individual will get sue for assault , and false imprisonment at the least . there be more case each day but one thing the justice do mention be marbury v madison . you can ignore an illegal law with impunity . we have the ruling . we also have past case quote in the h eller and mcdonald case . you imply there be none and that be false . would you like to take a stab at nunn v , state of georgia for instance ? star gazer cite a low court ruling that the gun grabber use just as sinjin use an early , oveturned case in people v zirillo . how can you miss so much ?	0

anyone who suggest abortion be a dispute between the right of a woman and a fetus be try to mislead you or be negligent about the nature of abortion right . this be not a dispute between woman vrs fetus but instead an issue between a woman ' s right to abortion and the interest of a small yet powerful vocal minority who believe they can project their view upon the majority . right be not simply just pass out but be base upon interest … something the supreme court base their conclusion during roe v wade . in the many year that have support abortion right i have never find a single pro - lifer who could prove , outside their opinion and others , how a fetus have an interest in be bear . unfortunately for them , fetus have never elect pro - lifer to speak their behalf of but instead vice - versa . the pro - life movement play as a self - appoint representative towards fetuses despite a lack of evidence or substance as to why a fetus , at the moment of conception , have an interest in living . so the debate be just whittle down to two faction ; those who believe that abortion be a right provide to woman or that a minority can oppress their view upon others because it happen to offend their belief . woman have a right to abortion because , as a nation , we have an invest interest in keep abortion legal for them . for nearly 70 year we know that the fruit of coercion childbirth do not payoff … they lead to the corruption of law enforcement , provide criminal another avenue of wealth , wreck death and mutilation upon desperate woman , destroy the healthcare system and leave behind an underground abortion rate that be rarely address by those who support coercion childbirth in the first place . fetus be immune from have an self - interest in be bear because they have never develop such feeling in the sheer majority of abortion ever perform . their brain be often far too primitive to hold such emotion or even awareness . if the fetus be incapable of feel outrage or offend by be abort then what be the big deal ? consider abortion be more legal during the time of our found father then today . tell me then , do someone who be mentally retard have a self - interest in stay alive ? what about someone in a coma ?	1
this be the root of the problem with the entire insurance base medical system . it be affordable and obtainable for those who do not actually need it , but impossible to get or unaffordable if you can . this be the heart of the debate . a lot of people find it morally unacceptable to let somebody with a treatable condition die in the rich country in the world for lack of care . at the same time in order for insurer to stay profitable , they need to not pay for treatment for people with expensive condition . and how do this differ from life insurance or car insurance ? or for credit card , for that matter ? the cost of a policy , or card , be proportional to the risk assume by the insurer . do not want to pay high premium , take the risk on yourself . period . i find it morally unacceptable to steal money from people in order to satiate another ' s morality . we have no god - give right to live forever as far as i know .	0
you be finally catch on . this be why we go to war against folk like saddam regard wmd , or declare sanction against syria and iran , but we do not go to war with the french or the british over wmd ' s . wmd ' s be inanimate object , and we all know that inanimate object be incapable of wag war . we also know that instable government and tyrannical leader be fully capable of wag war , and have do so in the past . it be good to see some of the gg ' s finally come over to the side of comon sense ! i think that the type of weapon do make a difference . a tyrant would be more dangerous to the world if he be arm with wmd rather than knife .	0

i find it interest that the star create the cloud and inturn the clouds form into star . one vicious cycle with no begining . in a forum devote to origin you offer the explainiation of no origin at all but rather meaningless existence . this be the main problem i have with evolution and it ' s application to physical science . a cycle with no begining have indeed no forseeable end . therefore on a personal level i have no hope of change anything . thing be , be and will continue to be this cycle of event . as this apply to biology any other life science . my action be only the result of my animal instict . i be not play the inner - child but rather the inner - beast . no law be pass to keep a beast in submission to another beast . govern body fail if there be no accountablity . that be the cruix of the discussion . i be accoutable to god . if i be wrong about creation , i have only miss out on a lifetime of animal behavior . if you be wrong about evolution , then i fear you be far the bad off then i . ok , now i ' d like to know why lappster think evolution have anything to do with morality ? do you actually know what evolution be lappster ?	0

of the court case that have be decide over 92 % have result in conviction . statistically , it ' s highly unlikely that there will be big deviance from this pattern for the remain case . i do not think present information that show that people with concealed handgun permit very likely kill more innocent people than criminal be a punch in the face to the vpc . oh vey ! vat du they say about the u.s. marshal service commit more crime than people they have actually arrest for a crime ?	1
i honestly can not think of a case be a non - materialistic approach explain something you can measure very well . be there something physical explain as well by non - materialistic method as well as electricity be explain by materialistic method ? besides pain , there be a plethora of experience that take place in a person ' s mind that can not be yet detect by science . imagination , taste , dream , art appreciation , etc . even though these thing be real , they can not be quantitatively describe in physical term , so they can not be treat by science	0
the reason that ' s the case be because there be many limitation on marriage but only homosexual claim they be be discriminate against . and if you rewind a little over 40 year , the exact same thing could be say about interracial marriage . archie ' s reply be a non - argument , and false at that . multiple other group state discrimination in marriage , but there be legitimate state interest prohibit their marriage . little thing like child rape , lack of consent , and other issue .	0

foundit , obviously you have never actually bother to read the libertarian position on marriage , which be to replace it with contract law , before complain about it . contract law easily cover phenomenon like divorce . if you spend 5 second research the issue you would realise this . your ' one big example ' be one big strawman , as usual . and yes , as above , ron paul ' s position , which be less strong , be to get the federal government out and leave it to the state . it ' s not a state ' s issue from a gay right perspective , if the supreme court of the us rule that discrimination of same - sex couple be illegal in marriage , as it do for inter - racial couple . what would this propose new contract that resemble marriage , be call ? we already have such a contract . there ' s no need to totally re - invent the wheel at this particular time . foundit be correct . it ' s tell that this issue only come up when people be look for a way to not recognize gay couple in marriage .	0

 note : when i say beneficial mutation , i be not talk about a gain of new genetic information to the genome . i see . then you be attempt to define evolution out of existance . by your definition ( not that of evolutionary biologist ) evolution require an increase in information . an unsupported creationist argument . define information in a meaningful way . please apply your definition to genetics and show why all genetic change be a decrease in information .	0

there have be . there ' s be a lot of grumble in congress and among the people more to the right of the scale . by say he still have support i assume you mean you think it be somehow shift to the democrat . my mistaken assumption . there be one major difference between the democratic spending plan and the republican plan ( for this election cycle anyway ) : dems want to repeal the tax cut , so they have a methodology for pay for all of this . oh , and they have not be too keen on send men to mar either . and just a quick aside , be it legal to invade iraq ? probably , b / c of the legislation broker cite . but i think he make a logical leap when he extrapolate ' justified ' from ' legal . ' the calculus use to say this be a ' just ' war be a very dangerous one , and if cross - apply could justify innumerable conflict ( how many nation can legitmately say that another nation have ' dangerous activity ' that make it pose an ' imminent threat ' ? at the very least , the entire mid - east ( arab / israel ) would explode under that logic ) .	0

again you be miss the historical context just as timothy mcveigh do . locke be an english philosopher who die in 1704 so he wasn ' t involve in write the constitution . do you know that jefferson be an advocate of racial segregation ?

' - thomas jefferson so if jefferson could be wrong about that then he could be wrong about this too . furthermore , as i already point out , other found father oppose him on the matter . race be the elephant in the room of american politics . segregation be not official , but who can deny that de facto segregation do not exist in the usa ? black stick to black and white to white . do you see any black in the tea party meeting ? how many black vote for jon mccain in the last presidential election ?	0

yes , you be correct . i find that discrepancy and correct my early post . i have not read far enough down in the original site to have see it when i originally post it . that ' s when i also be read the other information that i link . it get curiorsor and curiosor . just a week or so ago fbi reveal that they have find more undiscovered explosive in the basement of mcveigh ' s accomplice . it ' s like a replay of the keystone cop . i can not prove this but i suspect it be a lot of this information that be not widely share and talk about that drive bush ' s decision to remove saddam . if in fact saddam be implicate in the early wtc bombing and of course he try to murder bush 41 , then bush have all the justification in the world to remove saddam . dear god . you really have not a clue about what your talk about . away with the birdie i think . yousef be responsible for the 93 bombing , and he himself have very broad association with some of the al - qaeda hardcore ( osama say he do not know him and be in sudan while yousef stay in peshewer ) . osama wasn ' t responsible for the 93 bombing , he wasn ' t responsible for bali and madrid and i do not care what the world medium tell you . but by all mean keep spout your misinformation , i for one find it hilarious . the yousef - osama - saddam link be a conspiracy theory .	1

40 less people die a year be pretty good news - but i do not think you can attribute it to the change in gun law . if you plot the table of homicide , you get a pretty steady negative correlation which have be decline ever since 1991 . 2009 have not be a particularly spectacular decline compare to previous year . the difference of 43 death a year be the 4 th large flucuation since 1990 - not what you call insignificant . would this difference be make if more gun do equal more crime ?	0
your analysis might be correct , although i do not think i ' d bet big money on it . in particular , i be not sure about your conclusion here : `` the legislature be require to consider constitutional amendment in a joint session until final action be take . `` my reading be simply that if they do not reach a conclustion in one session , they have to take it up again in the next one . if it ' s go to pass , it have to pass in two consecutive year , so simply take it up in year three and say , `` do not pass in two consecutive year , fail `` may be legit . i think this be a fair conclusion . i go as far as i do because of what it seem to say about the governor call for a joint session . i may be wrong , but the text seem to instruct the governor to keep them in joint session until final action be take . in other word , it do not appear that the governor have an option . and it do not seem that the constitution allow for a legislative session that never end . i be not sure how else to square the two except that the legislature should pursue final action . of course , as you have point out , it really be hard to speculate on this one without any historical context of the amended amendment process , and / or the relevant legal precedent surround it . any thought on this ?	0

my moral compass do not care if genesis be literally true or not . can anyone explain why it should ? well , if genesis be in fact true , then we would have to assume that god be real and the bible more or less explain what he want , right ? and if there be someone `` up there `` who will damn you to eternal torment if you do not do what he want ( which be one interpretation of the bible ) than that might effect the way you act . i realize that that be not exactly the same as change your moral compass , but history have demonstrate that most people ' s moral will stretch to accomodate pressing need , and i think an actual vengeful diety would qualify .	0

 imo , that ' s beside the point . the problem with judicial fiat be that it ' s a way to get thing do despite the will of the people . sure , people may still oppose gay marriage even if it ' s do legislatively as oppose to judicially , but at least then they ' d have the chance and opportunity to do so . with only the judicial mean , people feel that they have no say whatsoever in something they feel be important . so i think there really be something to this concern than gay marriage be slip in via judicial fiat . of course you feel they should not have a say , so you have no problem with the idea of do by judicial fiat . but the whole process be do in the court use the process set up by the constitution . where the law be not clear on an issue , such as in massachusetts , it be the court job to decide . the court be a check on the injustice towards minority by the majority .	0
i think you have berezovsky in mind . the british refusal to return boris berezovsky to russia , be because he have be grant refugee status on the ground that he have good reason to fear persecution on political ground in his home state . james . persecution on political ground ? we be talk about a kingpin of russian organize crime here . he have be indict in russia for fraud and political corruption ( bribe politician ) and there be absolutly no question that he be guilty as sin . now he be hide in britain and actively plan a violent coup in order to overthrow the elected government . and he lay all this out to a british newspaper . political persecution if he return ? probably not . execution for treason ? that one seem more likely . in the extradition rhetoric arena , the russian be look a lot more reasonable then the british .	0
walk around naked endangers my right to innocent thought . watch little girl in the bathroom endangers their right to privacy . gay marriage do not affect anyone other than those get married . if you could effectively prove that two homosexual marry each other would harm me physically or mentally , ( and thus take away my right as a citizen ) , i would say you have a point . also , along the line of what mach say , no one have the right to walk around naked . the law apply equally . same with look at little girls naked . no one have that right . however , everyone except homosexual have the right to marry whomever ( not whatever ) they please . only homosexual be tell they can not marry other homosexual . your argument be contradict how can see people naked ifnringe on your personal thought and the other not ? also the right be not to marry whomever neterosexuals want . the limit apply to everyoen equally just people have different preference .	0
: it probably would have be good if scalia have say to himself when the case be bring before the court , `` there certainly be no consensus about the meaning of the second amendment and i , as an amateur historian , be certainly not go to force my own personal view on others . i will let the people decide through their elect representative how much gun control be necessary in their own community . `` nice interpretation by dennis henigan of hci . he would have love that but pretend it have not be rule as an individual right by the 8 2 nd congress , the doj in august 2004 with all the history and also by 35 supreme court ruling and two century of low court case that fill a 660 pg . book with majority opinion , he be either deaf / blind or outright deceitful . i opt for the latter . he and they know full well that all the court now be bind to consider any second amendment case as a civil right issue thanks to this ruling . `` let people decide `` have already be do , once when the constitution be ratify with the bor and again when the xivth amendment be pass . he may as well say race issue will be decide by elected representative the racial balance necessary in their own community `` he be completely dishonest and know full well that this be a republic base on the law of the land , the constitution and not a democracy as he suggest . one may as well follow the piper over the cliff like a herd of lemming to not recognize this time worn tune play by the gun grabber . even new justice sotomayor , who claim she rule by precedent will be bind by the heller decision if she remain true to her purported philosophy . the debate between sui juris and re judicia should no longer be an issue with the liberal on this right ! it either applies to all or it apply to none which would result as justice w.o . douglas write : `` a revolution `` . it be in the government ' s ( federal especially ) best interest to keep our soldier employ in foreign country . btw , i think the court decision in nunn v . state of georgia do the best summation of this right !	0

among homosexual men in particular , casual sex , rather than commit relationship , be the rule and not the exception . and even when they do enter into a more committed relationship , it be usually of relatively short duration . for example , a study of homosexual men in the netherlands ( the first country in the world to legalize `` marriage `` for same - sex couple ) , publish in the journal aid in 2003 , find that the average length of `` steady partnership `` be not more than 2 year ( maria xiridou et al . , in aid 2003 , 17:10 2 9 - 1038 ) . and where do they find the participant for this study , bath house and bar ? gay men be a hidden population in statistical relms . it be very hard to get a true random sample of data on gay men . study will say whatever the funder of the study want it to say . you just get data from the right place . if you want gay men to look like rag alcoholic get your study participant in a bar . if you want them to look like sexaholics then you get your study subject in bathouses . the truth be that to have honest statistical data you need random sample .	1

would depend on how sucessful they think the handing in be , but do not you have to register for a leicence ? so all legal owner be know already and can be check off against the gun they have hand in , i would imagine that there must be department of the police who deal with track black market unregisted gun so these could be crack down opon . in addition you would have to make possesion of a firearm illegal , then you have to balance defend your property with revealing you be commit a crime ( will be fairly obvious if you use one and you would have to get rid of it anyway when forensics investigate the crime scene ) . would also have to look at country that have carry out sucessful one to see if there be any little point or mistake to pick up . if there be a lot of resistance you could make possesion of a gun attempt murder , would make people think very carefully whether they would want to carry them , especailly criminal - comunity service or light sentace for a mugging or long term prison sentance for attempted murder if they be carry a gun while do it , even in bank robbery they would likely think twice about the additional year . wow ehat a brave new world you live in . now let say just 1 % of all gun owner resist ( in the us that be several hundred thousand pepper through the land ) . with medium attention to such infighting between government and citizens how do you deal with this ?	1

i will not turn this into another debate that often come up with this issue . but for the sake of clarification can you tell me if you believe it possible that the right of the be ' s inside the mother be be infringe upon ? that be , when do you deem it worthy of protection ? ( i will not debate this , i be just curious as to your view ) . actually , i be of the opinion that the fetus have no natural right of its own . any right we grant to a person as a citizen or national be grant at the moment of birth . by grant equal right to a 3 week old fetus that you do to a 20 year old man , you be endanger the right of the woman who carry that child . yes , i believe that in most circumstance , the child should be carry to term , but there be exception to every rule , and i be not quite ready to forsake the life and health of woman to protect unborn child . yes , i think the unborn child be worthy of protection , but not any more so than the mother , in fact probably less .	0

the whole point be that you can not use this warped version of the razor for hypothesis testing . in the example , impetus be a hypothesis for a cause for movement . ockham eliminate the hypothesis as a description of the phenonmenon . and if there be two compete hypothesis that be actually hard to choose between ? as they get close , it become less possible to choose by instinct or testing . a principle come in handy .	0

look , i lose my response ; i be not go to retype it because in hindsight i be just repeat the same thing : you and i both know the issue be the morality of the act , choice be meaningless because all the law be , be the use of force to prevent ( or prevent far ) immoral choice . me condemn something as immoral be the same as advocate it be outlaw which be the exact same ' make a decision ' as tell someone that just because they can kill others do not mean it ' s their choice . the high dollar question be whether the fetus be human , biologically it be ; not at the time all that a human can be but none of us ever achieve that . you say you be concentrate on 9 month , i do not see a difference you can abort child rear just as easily after birth by kill the child or abandon it . i assume you take the position life begin at conception and biological potential be sufficient to claim to be a human . then why do we stop at a fertilized egg ? if you mean potential , be suppose to become , or posses the correct dna to one day be then birth control would fit under birth control as would masturbation for you abortion be the immoral act of kill a human be . if we say base on result then kill be kill . the reason be irrelevant , there be no difference between abortion , capital punishment or self defense . yes these be extreme , but its where your position lead . at some point we make a choice and say that go to far , but then we be back at choice and what be to much for one and not enough for another .	0
since evolution can not prove the book of genesis ( ancient history ) false , and creationism do have some historical backing , they be comparable and they directly conflict . only those ignorant of science and evolution think that `` evolution `` have anything to do with the bible . i guess that ' s because creationism be an attempt to pretend that mythology be somehow scientific and make silly statement about science . it seem that science be somehow anti - bible in that case when science debunks ignorance .	1

the simple fact be , in a civilized society no one have the freedom to do whatever she want with her own body . liberty unfettered by morality be the operative rule of anarchy , not civilization . at any give moment , each of us be constrain by hundred of law reflect our moral responsibility to our community . the most primal of those rule be the obligation of a mother to her helpless child . this be one of the reason the public outcry against susan smith be so intense . strawman . the argument be not to do whatever one wish with one body . the argument be soley that one do not have to have another attach , ever , against one will .	0
if you would just stop ramble on as if you know what you be say dane , you might just learn the truth . as compare to `` truth `` ( capital t ) . yes , creationist theocrats have this tendency to portray their subjective belief as truth , their wishful thinking as fact . no surprise there .	1
no only do the experience one have make that person , but so do their effect on others . i do not mean that only this and nothing else define a human be , i just use this on thing to justify abortion . this be an odd question , i mean , i can see myself save someone ' s life if my stake be relativly low , but to kill myself completely to save someone i do not know ? i do not think so . would you , because i doubt it . of course they do . for someone who put importance on the ability to think i be surprise that you believe mentally handicapped people be as valuable as the average person . value be of course the key word here . value can be interpret to mean many different thing include value to the human society . even the humanistic perspective have to take into account that the human society as a whole even if it be only a small portion . i do not think the handicapped can hold a great deal of value in the human society when compare to the avereage ' intelligent and able - bodied human ' , would not you agree ? if so then where do they make up for this imperfection to increase their ' value ' to be equal to that of an able - body human ?	0
do sufficient science and history in its total amount to enough evidence to conclusively disprove the existence of god ? happy i think perhaps you be confuse . 1 . i know of no meaningful definion of the term `` god ' as it pertain to reality . 2 . when you mention science and history , that implies you be interested in reality . 3 . there be no evidence to support mythological deity , god or god or odin or the easter bunny . * so , yes there be no evidence of the existence of any mytholgoical god . * * yes , there be no evidence that the universe be create , or if that statement even have meaning if the universe always be , and always will be . p . s . there be easter bunny . - mach	0
from my memory your medical reference both show the trend you state , but they be also limit in geography and sample ( two city ) , and provide no casue and effect , merely a curious relationship in the number . well let us deal with one thing at a time . the nejm study about washington d.c. conclude that ban handgun save 47 life each year . the study do not conclude that it be just a `` curious relationship in the number . `` go back to that thread and read the study . if you be look for evidence that be absolutely without any degree of uncertainty then you will not find it . you can not prove thing to a 100 % certainty with statistic . what you can do be show what be probably true and what be probably not true . even in court you be not expect to prove that someone be guilty to a 100 % certainty . you be expect to prove that they be guilty beyond a reasonable doubt .	0
i can see your point , though i be confuse about gay sex drive , your say a gay man ' s sex drive be not feminine ? be it reasonable for a heterosexual to want to avoid close contact with a homosexual under certain condition ? like be naked for example ? there be gay that go to my gym , be i be homophobic if i purposely avoid shower with him ? i can surely pick my friend ; naturally my interest would hardly mirror a homosexual interest . some be even quite feminine and would hardly be interested in the same subject as me . be it reasonable for me to be selective about whom my friend can be ? well , since we be talk about a gay man , i would guess it would most likely be masculine . yeah , you be be kinda homophobic . why would you possibly care if a gay man see you in the shower ? they be not go to do anything to you . if you treat someone differently for no reason other then the fact that they be gay , that ' s homophobia . gay be just like everyone else , excpect they be sexually attract to the same gender . their interest cover the same spectrum as yours , sex aside . they be just as likely to be masculine or feminine as a straight man . gay be , in everyway outside of sexual preference , just like straight . so while you can certainly be selective about who your friend be , if you write someone off just for be gay that would be a shame , and a sign of prejudice .	0
voting be not a third way , it be the rule of the majority by virtue of their posession of the great force . it be where vote do not decide , but where individual be allow to decide for themselves , that there be freedom and justice . and anarchy . be i allow to kill someone if i feel like it ?	1
morality , in the strict sense of the word , deal with that which be innately regard as right or wrong . the term be often use to refer to a system of principle and judgment share by cultural , religious , and philosophical concept and belief , by which human subjectively determine whether give action be right or wrong . you do know the difference between right and wrong do not you ? i see no reason teacher should not play a part in attempt to teach pupils the difference . up to a point , but ther be thing some people would consider ' wrong ' that others would not . for example , most muslim would consider drink alcohol to be wrong , while most non - muslim would not . some people believe it be wrong to hit someone , whether or not they have hit you , others believe you have a right to retaliate . some believe that sex be a big deal and should be reserve only for marriage , others believe any activity between consent adult be morally ok . all of these be moral issue . which view should school teach ? should they teach that kill people be wrong ? how about steal ? should they put thing in context , so that steal be only wrong in a society that recognise personal property . should they conflate morality with law ? that open yet another can of worm .	0

the question be why do you change the sentence ? as have be say , the thermonuclear reaction take place in the core of the sun be not mention in the theory of evolution . so , you manage to make the first sentence of your ' proof ' complete and utter rubbish . not a good start then . some other question i would like answer about your ' proof ' would be : why be it assume that the nuclear reaction take place in the sun ' s core would be perfectly linear ? from above , if the sun ' s life be around 10 billion year , why would 4.6 billion year be its half - life ? do you know what a half - life be with regard to nuclear reaction ? that ' s just the first paragraph . if you can answer them satisfactorily then i might get onto the rest of your ' proof ' . smiley as i say , for clarification , and no other reason . it ' s all drivel to me anyway , so i do not see the problem in add evolution onto theory . show where it say that if you would , and clarify your question . if you will notice , it say approximately , not exactly half its life . i be surprise you could not deduce that by just read what it say . why be you ask me this question smiley as if i write the article ? can not you tell the difference between quote a piece and write it ?	1

i be sayin that salvation be not a choice . we be pre - destine by god and the bible clearly state this fact . no free will do not exist . rom . 8:29 but read 8:26 - 39 so you can read it in context . ephesians 1 : 5 but read 1 : 1 - 23 so you can read it in context . i get ya , but i still disagree . if free will doesnt exist , then why should i make an effort to do anything ? if i be destine to be wealthy , then no matter how lazy i be today , i will be wealthy sometime down the road . and if im destine to poor , no amount of hard work and diligence on my part can change that . why wouldnt i just drift along life and allow destiny to take me where i will inevitably end up ?	0

if someone say the big bang people have to say the big bang and not the `` evolution of the universe `` because it will just waste time . now you be be ridiculous . the big bang be not the evolution of the universe . the word `` evolution of the universe `` do not necessarily entail the big bang . for example , brane theory offer an alternative theory to explain the evolution of the universe . but claim that the `` evolution of the universe `` be part of the theory of evolution be somewhat like claiming that because kate hudson have achieve stardom , she be produce vast amount of energy through hydrogen fusion . why be it that creationists believe that every word have only a single meaning ? by the way , i have always hear the creationist invention `` gte `` refer to as the general theory of evolution - you know , as if there be some relation to the general theory of relativity .	0

you be miss the big picture . i do not see the conflict , biblically speak . because in the kingdom of god there be also judgment . ever read about the israeli come under judgment and be enslave by the babylonian ? why do that happen to them ? because they do not love god and their neighbor as themselves . they break the law of love . god do not break it , they do . so , because they hat and do not turn from their wicked way , they come under judgment . and if you read the book of judge , that usually humble the people and turn their heart back to god . that ' s why i say there be no conflict . god ' s economy make sense . ah i see so god be more than willing to use extreme punishment for not love your neighbor . like how sodom and gomorrah be punish for not love their neighbor .	1

i do not believe in any god , but thankyou for assume anyone who disagree with your ridiculous assertion about prove god non - existance must be a theist . just like creationists assume anyone who disagree with creationism must be an atheist . you be just as bad as them , and your argument , if you could call them that , just as short on substance . so why be you here ? do you have anything to offer of any substance ?	0

cute , but not quite . the claim be that we want everybody to have gun . so i ' d like to see some proof that gun owner have call for the repealing of the federal age limit that cover the purchase of firearm , and for the prohibited person list that keep felon , the insane , the drug addict , and those that beat their wife , from legally buy gun . if those of my chosen party have make the claim that we want criminal , terrorist and the others in these category to have gun , then i ' d like to see them . otherwise the claim that we want everybody arm be nothing more than a lie . the private property of whom ? we have security stop along the mexican / american border to search for drug and other contraband . how be it not possible on the way to and from dc ? simple answer ? dc have a lot less budget than the usa government . more complex answer ? just look at the commuter , there be over 400,000 people that come to work in dc every day ( see link in my last post ) . make the preposterous assumption that they all come in at a constant flow , just look at 400,000 of them and assume that you would only check them come in , that ' s ~ 4.6 people admit per second for every second of the work week . good luck with that . good luck with convince people that it ' s constitutional , as well - airport get away with it , but only because there be such a ( largely unfounded ) fear of death by terrorist that they can get away with something which be constitutionally shady . a quick search give me two relevant result almost immediately .	0
i be incredibly surprise you have not get it now , especially as you put your stance as ' libertarian ' . i be not a libertarian because i want to legalize drug and prostitution or remove the age limit on alcohol and cigarette . if the definition of libertarian have become that , the world be seriously screw up . i be a libertarian because in my country , the tax be above abnormal . 50 - 65 % for an average salary , and up to 80 % for a ' ' millionaire ' ' basically no one can be rich in my country . every time i get my salary , i be look really forward to it . i work hard for my money , but it be tear me down mentally , that half my money be take away to pay for some alcoholic who be to drink to get his money himself . it be kill the work spirit in me , and several others . that ' s why i be a libertarian . libertarianism emphasise freedom of the individual , and limited government . a stereotypical libertarian view would be for the legalisation of prostitution . that ' s why i be surprise .	0

i believe dametel be refer to leviticus 20:13 - ' if a man lie with a man as one lie with a woman , both of them have do what be detestable . they must be put to death ; their blood will be on their own head .

`` even the sight of gun , which people think of as object that can hurt others , can induce aggressive idea . `` - leonard berkowitz so you see a cop on the street , you see he ' s arm , that ' s enough to induce aggression and violence , possibly cause you to hurt others , simply because you saw that somebody else be arm ?	1
my opinion , their ban a gun because of the way it look they seem to think an ak47 be bad than a regular gun because it look like a military gun the only true ( assault weapon ) be fully automatic i have . sereral ak47s but their semi - auto thats not an assault weapon ! i think you have your image of an assault weapon slightly skew . an assault weapon by its very name be a weapon design to harm another human . this do not mean full auto it just mean that it be never design to be a target / hunt / self defense weapon .	0

2 ) along the same line , how do the appendage create by mutation actually become something usefull ? for example an animal might have develop a wing like appendage , but it wouldn ´ t have the correct muscle that it would need to actually move the wing . i suspect that you be think of bird . but early bird have finger claw on those wing . it be generally true that no organ ever spring into existance completely develop where nothing exist before . the wing of bat , bird , and pterodactyl be merely the modify fore - limb of a tetrapod . there be evidence that insect wing may have arise from some sort of thermal panel . and of course , size have considerable relevance to flight . wingless spider fly by spin a loop of silk that be carry by the move air . very small insect require almost no wing to fly . what they do be more similar to a whale in water than a bird in air . if by chance , a small animal be upsized because of a competetive advantage , and the wing be too , then it become a large fly animal .	0
in a few decade , it might be possible that technological progress would develop an `` artificial womb `` that can nurture a fetus almost from day one until birth . how would that change the abortion debate ? that would most likely ( imo ) reduce the number of abortion perform . it would depend , i think , on how viable it be to transfer the embryo into the artificial womb . force surgery would not be an option if i have anything to do about it .	0
what be not fertilize be what a woman flush in each monthly cycle . she be not flushing people or potential people , and how sad it be that you can not understand that . actually , accord to your use of the word `` person , `` she be . a significant percentage of fertilize egg fail to implant and be instead pass . how sad ( and typical ) that you have not bother to educate yourself about these thing .	0
i do not have to do that . if there be not abortion be perform in the 3 rd trimester then why would the u . s . senate pas a bill ban it ? so what you be say be that you can not ? as a political move to satisfy the pro - life constituent that put them in office .	0
that be an incorrect statement . viability seem to be the topic that get little mention here . humanity , consciousness , personhood , sentience , etc . be all extremely debatable , as have be demonstrate , sometimes ad nauseam . to you , it may be an incorrect statement . but if it be , you have to tell me what it be you kill and take the life away from when you abort the zygote . not know if it be be kill or not know someone want to kill it make no difference . injustice be still practice there , and not even some abortion doctor realize it .	0

you be right , how silly of me to think that democrat or this buffoon of a president would have anything to do with a budget plan or even present a comprehensive budget ; they have fail to do so now since 2008 . another illustration of the massive failure of leadership the democrat party and this president represent . right on ! the obama administration be a colossal financial disaster . if he do not have another trillion dollar to x he can not do anything . tax and spend - that ' s all those liberal turkey know how to do .	1

and once again you have only your twisted opinion and nothing to support it . 1 ) why be the philosophy of jefferson twist ? if you can not say its because you be a typical anti american liberal . 2 ) nothing to suppoprt it ? if anti - american liberal position be make illegal as per the constitution then everyone would have to vote among the conservative . the political spectrum would simple shift so that both extreme be in the intelligent range . on the far left you ' d have romney and on the far right you ' d have ron paul . now that would be an intelligent election consistent with our very very conservative constitution .	1
i be confuse . what exactly be the difference between a civil union and a marriage . from what i have find , they be identical with the exception of one be religious and the other secular . be there a large legal difference ? there be a pretty huge difference . civil union be not nationally recognize , for one thing , since not every state have them . if you travel to a state that do not offer civil union , then your union be not valid there . i think there ' s a problem with dissolve those union as well . the big difference , though , be the right that these union provide . there be over 1,000 legal protection and right that marriage provide that civil union do not . i will try and find a list of difference .	0
intellignet design seem to have a large following . the fact that somebody believe in intellient design do not necessarily mean that they disagree with evolution . a lot of folk ( i would say the majority ) view it as evolution use as a vehicle for intellient design ( basically `` god plan it and make it all happen `` ) . now you have ruin it ! you be not suppose to mention god . that ' s the whole idea . id be stealth creationism . x pretend that there be some scientific basis for the assertion that there be some sort of magical designer that be responsible for everything , but they do not say it ' s god . if they do that , then id would be religion and introduce it into school would be unconstitutional .	1

anti - choicers do not give two whit about life , or really believe in the absolute value of a fetus . this story be a good example of that . i bet a lot of so - call `` pro - lifer `` would support this court ' s decision , even though the mother pose no real threat , and she could have miscarry the fetus : for anti - choicers , it ' s just about control and power over woman . they do not care about life . ( except their own . ) this same mother could be a person who do not have access to pre - natal care . they would not defend that right either . because they don ' t care about the fetus . they do not care about life . they do not care about health . they care about power and money and push people around . that ' s all . that ' s quite a leap , even for you . how do you know that the officiers be pro - life ? or that any pro - life people would condone the officiers ' behavior in this instance . i certainly think it be excessive . i guess i must not be pro - life by your illogic .	1

for those who be pro - life , how much of a role do your belief in a soul ( assume you hold such belief ) play into your view on abortion ? to explore this , would your view on a particular abortion change if you know for certain that a particular fetus have no soul ? the reason i bring this up be that , for those of us with largely secular view , the idea of the soul be closely analogous to our idea of mental existence , sentience , etc . i suspect , therefore , that much of our thinking may end up be similar but that you view this mental essence as start at conception and we take the scientific view of it happenning much later in a pregnancy . i know that , apart from that arguement , you value potential more than we do . however , i suspect that concept of the soul do play a role in the view of most on the pro - life side . would you be willing to discuss such idea ? i think more than this be the principle of human dignity . that human have inherent dignity and value at every stage of life . this be transcendent of whether they be conscious or unconscious and it be why we treat 24 week premie who have no real conscious existence and a 30 year old automobile accident victim in a coma on a respirator and you and me the same . so strongly do human recognize this inherent dignity that even in death a person be dignify with a funeral ceremony recognize their life have inherent meaning and value . we build memorial to those who be victimize in life .	0
i personally think that abortion be wrong . i think that a fetus be still a baby . i do think that abortion can be okay but only if the mother ' s life be in danger , otherwise they should live with it . they should have stay away from the cause of pregnancy . if you think that it ' s ok when the mother ' s life be in danger . why would not it be ok when her life be not in danger ?	0

i think a good question be what preserve their life for so long ? it be the mercy of god that upholds and preserve people in this life . it be the sin of human being that be responsible for death . this be not correct . god do go ' out of his way ' to keep everyone alive . besides that , god would never be present with any kind of problem , much less a problem of overpopulation . good grief , to suggest that the god who create the earth would have a problem with overpoulation be , frankly , as ridiculous as try to find some passage in the bible that condones , allow , or support any and every abortion that occur . that be ridiculous . ok , i understand now . all those people , include child and the fetus of pregnant woman be all sinful and god have to murder them in tsunami , earthquake , etc . , be that how god deal with overpopulation ? i guess that war be part of god ' s plan , too , because the recent invasion of iraq wipe out more than 100,000 iraqis accord to god ' s plan for deal with overpopulation .	1
mizmax , that ' s completely different . the infirtle couple who want to have child and be capable of do so with sciencetific method may be marry . however , infirtle couple who do not have the capability and wont try to , should not . have child be not a requirement for marriage - it ' s what marriage be all about . so , if have child be not a requirement fro marriage , then gay should be ok , right ? if it be what it be all about , if you marry a woman who be incapable of have child , even with scientific method , then you be not really marry ? what about lesbian ? they can have childre , with a little help from the local sperm bank . in facst , they can both get pregnant . do tht mean that a marriage between 2 lesbian be twice as valid ? what if a couple of gay men adopt ? then be their marriage valid ? if i have a vasectomy , be i divorce ? you be confuse me . please explain .	1
so let me get this straight , you reject global warming , despite there be support by almost 97 % of scientist and be clearly be observe by the melting of glacier , rise in sea level , change in weather pattern , etc . but you believe in a magical genie in the sky that grant your wish ? people like you be gon na get us all kill , keep your stupid superstition to yourself and please , if you ever have any child , dont spread this bull , ok ? thank you oh dear she ' s attack everyone now obviously a very unhappy kitten . and i can not even pray for her . and if you can not take tantrum throw stop do it , try work on that new word you have invent or your punctuation and spelling , or print up your global warming theory prove all them science folk wrong . may even get a noble prize ( beats beauty school ) . go get them tiger . , .	1
which be exactly why i ask why be these opinion shallow and vaccuous ? and just to push your opinion a little further , if the soul enter the new be at fertilization , then do this mean that those girl ( though very rare ) who be bear just from an unfertilized egg have no soul . be a special case make for these human being ? one might ask the same question of the even more rare boy born of a virgin mother . i be not say that you be wrong . i be just wonder if your theory extend this far . smiley as to the first part , i answer you above . regard the second part ; what in the world be you talk about ? girl who be bear from unfertilized egg ? and boys bear of virgin mother ? can you post any evidence of these case ? beside jesus of course , because we know his father be god and that he possess the holy spirit .	1
and what do noah do about the termite ? two answer : they be either of the ant kind and do not eat wood until they undergo hyperevolution after the landing of the ark , or they be place in a suspended state of hibernation by ' awlmighty gawd ' ( only two - one male and one female , in spite of the fact that termites do not actually propagate that way ) . it be , after all , the word of gawd , as reveal in the wholly babble .	1

i be go to respond to jake , capo and electrolyte point by point when i realize that it would just be a waste of time ; where as this post sum up the issue so rationally , concisely and reasonably that it be worth quote just to repeat the truth it represent . thank you chloe for put it so simply that anybody except a pro - abortion liberal can get it . in fact , you know that even they get it when they ignore it . so you get to whine and moan and complain ( lie ) that i do not address your point , then when i challenge you to support your point against my counterargument , you say that you do not need to . you be a hypocrite , archie . ignore it ? bhbcu64 make a valid point and make significant elaboration . the only responses we have see be ' you be wrong ' with no explanation , and two ' why do this follow ?

well then , why the bloody hell would we trust your carnal mind to tell us about the thing of god , or in fact why would we trust the carnal mind of the writer of the bible to tell us about the thing of god . you would not . more likely you will pursue your wiccan folly until judgment day and then wonder what hit you .	1
hopefully the democrat will finally get the message that we do not want their freaking liberal idea . wink finally an other conservative in this site . i mean who do these people think they be ? try to pass amendment like the fairness act . but i be not surprise that some order be come back to be leader . when the government swing to far to one side , ( in this case leave ) its ganna swing back to the other side , we just as conservative , need to make sure we do not go to right , or we will have do just as bad as the liberal .	0
they accept donation , however . if these donation exceed the cost of host a website ( pretty inexpensive ) , where do the money go ?

i heard just shortly after the official passage that the nutter at the aclu be already poise to argue that the state supreme court reverse the decision for the exact opposite reason they argue to block pro 22 , geez talk about get your argument straight . it will get dismiss as frivolous just like last time . these big baby be suffer from `` shallow hal `` disorder . they somehow believe of the majority vote in their favor - then it be a mandate , but the minute it be not in their favor . [ well ] they fall into a grand mal seizure . there must not be something `` fair `` in it as far as they be concerned - fair have nothing to do with it , our law do not exist for fairness sake . they exist for clarity . let us not forget the most important over arching reality here . this be something that be not even suppose to be up for discussion for legislative agenda . we have no business even talk this nonsense . gay be not some `` class `` that need to be protect . they be citizen engage in a behavior that fall wildly short of the overall purview of not only the electorate as the exist status quo [ regardless of political affiliation ] but be nothing short of a deviant sexual proclivity , that . and our law do not ' exist to morally equivocate deviancy with that of the morally clear . it be a simple matter of constant vs . variable . our law protect what you be [ the constant ] not who you become [ the variable ] , what then do we say ? do we create law and burden our court with personal subjectivity . or do we look to the objective as we have , and should continue to do so . these radical homosexual activist be literally insane to think people be simply go to let them walk all over the natural order of thing in favor of a bio [ illogical ] behavior ? the us constitution do not guarantee the equality of feeling , nor do it behavior . people have to start clear the closet . so to speak , and simply be down to earth and accept that not all your decision be go to be popular one , and homosexuality be one of them - and you certainly do not win fan by think you can leverage the guilt game on people even think you can draw comparison between color [ innate ] and sexual preference [ choice ] as a basis for some perceive civil right , it be just plain and utter nonsense . so you yourself could have go gay but choose to be attract to woman ?	1

it mean life be holistic , not reductionist . life , as be the genome , be a system - - an irreducibly complex system - - not an assortment of piece that just happen to be fit together over time via random genetic change cull by nonrandom death . no it mean that the genome operate in a more complex way than be previously believe . it do not mean that `` life be irreducibly complex `` since that term be not even sufficiently well define to test the assertion . and give the scattering of information into many piece i would say that more and more it look like `` piece that happen to be fit together `` . more and more like a complex kludge . exactly what one might expect to find in an evolved system rather than a design or deliberate or intentional one !	0

biology should not simply deal with the fact about different animal , natural selection , evolution , etc . but should also deal with how information be gather , and different way of analyze it as well as different hypothesies rather than what be think at the time to be the fact . if science deal with how information be gather , different way of analyzing , and different hypothesis , then it involve worldviews . the base for the worldview of a sizable part of the population should not be exclude . maybe in saddam hussien ' s iraq , maybe in communist russia , but not in the united state .	1
i be sure you be right , but then again , they be also disageeing with countless other people on that point as well . so , i guess in your view , educate people against prejudice and intolerance be a bad thing .	1
i do think that obama have get a little spineless on this issue , which i do not like . but jyoshu - let not pretend palin / mccain would have be good advocate . oh i certainly do not pretend that and certainly do not claim that either - - though a couple of left - wing poster here ( who will remain nameless for now ) might take the bizarre step of say my post to you amount to as much , if history be any indicator . maybe we will all luck out and they will forget their lens of bias at home , and instead read claim people actually make .	0
. and that ' s because the medical establishment have make it illegal to treat any disease in this country with anything other than fda approve drug or surgery . it ' s all about the money , man . you apparently know as much about law as you do about science . you would not be arrest for have someone willingly consume a plant unless that plant be a controlled substance and last time i check , poppy and weed be not cancer cure .	1
apparently you have get one powerful set of rise color glassed . i guess you spend a lot of money on those 1 - 900 psychic too . sad nowhere be it scientifically inaccurate ? be you serious ? waxy yup . give me an example of a true inaccuracy , instead of work to poke fun . do you honestly think anyone will take you seriously ( except the evolutionist ) if you do not provide reason for your apparent problem with scripture . be you scared because you see the `` ancient `` comment on subject you think science have `` discover `` since the `` enlightenment `` ? man , how arrogant can you get ? you remind me of the pharasees . arrogant presupposition be no substitue for confront your ignorance my friend . either explain how the bible speaks accurately on sophisticated subject as give above , or do not bother posting .	1

true . it would have to go through the low court unless ' fast - track ' . scotus could rule that ffca be not applicable because it be a license issue and not a statute . that ' s the sad state of affair that exist today . we can not depend on the scotus act in accordance with the constitution . emoticonxmad imo , the creation , by an activist scotus , of a phantom right be more dangerous than the loss of that bogus right . if we have a scotus that foillowed the constitution and do not dabble in legislate , i would not be fearful of ' big brother ' . there be ' real ' safeguard to protect us from that possibility , so we do not need scotus to ' make up ' new one . this i do not agree with . i can not see how the court could rule in favor of doma base on 1 4 th amendment protection . as far as the law go , the marriage license from couple a from state 1 be the same as the license from couple b from the same state . how could it be constitutional to refuse to recognize the marriage license from couple a , yet recognize the marriage license from couple b from the same state ? that be unconstitutional .	0

since evolutionism and creationism be both attempt to answer the same question , ( i . e . , how come existence ? ) they be mutally exclusive , and if one be true , it automatically falsify the other . this mean that if evolutionism be accept as true , then logically creationism , and by extension the entire bible , be false . the notion that the bible be completely and uncompromisingly true be paramount to christianity . with all that in consideration , it should be no surprise that christian will do everything possible to show evolution as false i see a subtle distinction here . creationism be concern with the spiritual origin of people . `` evolutionism `` be entirely concern with explain the nature and history of the physical world . the conflict of opinion arises out of the importance of the detail - can genesis be accept as a parable which contain a fundemental truth or must it be take as a historical account ?	0
but i agree , the video be indeed propaganda and cross the line into `` lie `` .

you be a bit late there , be not you ? marriage have become a state institution as much as a religious one , and i see no practical way to undo that at this point . well if there can be a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage , why not to remove marriage from the federal government ? where do they get that power constitutionally ? so that would mean state can choose not to recognize any marriage constitutionally . i think that marriage be a church issue . let gay , straight , everyone get civil union to be recognize legally . but leave marriage to the church .	0
i be leave the job to those more qualified . i be weigh the yes - vote against the no - vote , and the yes - vote be strongly win . this be what the word consensus mean . qualify global warming skeptic still seem to me to be a small minority . 650 be mention in this report . but when i think of all the climate scientist in the world , there must be ten or hundred of thousand on the other side of the debate . which leave us with ? if you say ' an appeal to majority ' you win teh prize ! you be not really leave it to them when you be talk about enact legislation base on a theory which be still under debate . most doctor will not prescribe marijuana in this country either . i guess we should just leave that to them though , since they be more qualified .	1
again show me something other than an opinion . describe how the avian lung could have evolve over time . other than it do it . maybe firstly you should explain how god work ? in what way do he manupilate matter in defience of the law of physic , where do he dwell , how can we not observe such a be ? and all the other question of the supernatural . the theory of a god be actually a lot , lot more complicated than evolution as you have to explain how god work to get even basic science point .	0
oh really ? some day a court case be go to come around and it ' s ultimately go to be decide that the second amendment be not an individual right but rather a collective one ? what will keep new court case from come up now that there ' s precedent and the ultimate determination will be that nobody in the country have any right of any sort ? i be sure the racist white segregationist after plessey think exactly as you do now , `` that settle the matter . `` little louise brown have a big surprise ! for them . you still have not walk upon the thin ice of the `` well regulate `` wording , we note .	0
what be the choice of the so call ' pro - choice ' people ? to ban or not to ban abortion , and clearly they have make their choice . even to them the word ' abortion ' be hard to speak for they know abortion be kill , so drop the euphemism . because i call a spade a spade that make me a woman hater and basher ? sister , sister now , let examine the anti - prohibition of abortion case ( at least you didnt call it pro - choice ) . i have never say that the defender of the right to abortion want every woman to have an abortion . so please dont put word in my mouth and what be the choice of the so call ' pro - life ' people ? suffer through a rape or incest induced pregnancy , die from pregnancy complication without a chance of terminate it , or force woman who take proper precaution which fail to go through an unwanted pregnancy while likely lose her job , scholarship , any chance at life , etc . some great choice there emoticonxrolleyes i ' d swear the whole group of them have an underlying misogynistic syndrome .	1

not only that , to suggest that untold number of woman would seek illegal abortion be a question - begging claim that have no grounding in history , logic , or reason . it be an unfounded , unproven claim . it be a betrayal to sound judgment to make decision base upon unfounded prediction into the future . but it be base on history . there be plenty of history show that woman have illegal abortion . or , if their family have money . go to costa rica or britain to have a legal one in those country . woman die or have severe medical emergency due to illegal abortion . doctor and nurse be prosecute for provide these service .	0

with regard to the cousin argument if a creature evolve into a new specie would not the old specie not exist any more ? no , say you have get 200 of some specie . by some event , 100 member be seperated . now we have two group of 100 . each group go through different selection and they accumulate small change . eventually , they will be different enough so that they be no longer able to interbreed . that do not mean one group automatically have to die so we remain at the same number of specie . of course , one group might get some significant advantage which allow it to come back and ownzor the original area so the other group get wipe out .	0
right now , i might consider it , as i be now a few week away from my graduation . back then , i would not , as i have just begin college ( i be in my sophomore year for my bs - now i be about to get my m ) . however , there be also that other major part of my decision - i never have the intention to become pregnant , and we even take step to make sure i would not . that also be a major factor in any of my decision on it . another decision that involve my work be that from about my fifth month on ( acording to the doctor i speak with ) - i would be unable to work - that ' s four month , and while right now i be in good standing with my company and they might even allow me to do that , back then i be just start out , and would be unable to do so . so , i ' d say that at the moment if that be to happen , and that i be pay a stipend ( i know of no place near me that do so ) and then give the baby up for adoption , my fiance and i would seriously consider the prospect . i know that in the future - in five year or so - we expect to be able to have pay off all our loan , and we will then consider actually have a baby . so in summary - now i would consider it , but back when i have the actual abortion ( 6 year ago or so ) i would not consider it . that sound like an honest answer . how do you feel about it at the time ? how do you feel about it now ? just try to educate myself more . huck	0
so you ' d rather have a god that do not have any standard whatsoever on sex and relationship , to the point where anything - go ? a god of anarchy be not one i ' d want to have anything to do with . be your think really this simplistic ? either i have to agree with you or i be an anarchist ? be that all the complexity you can handle ? this or that ? black or white ? the best soda in the world be sprite and everything else be wrong ? what a boring little pigeon - hole world you live in . no harm no foul - that be where i stand on sex and romance . kid , animal and those who do not or can not consent be off - limit . k ? now that i have establish ( again ) how i feel on that matter , let me reinstate . any god that allow love and intimacy for only a select group be viscious .	1
the only difference be that the evolutionist be correct . btw , they have find the crater which be make by the asteroid . the mass extinction be a fact and so be evolution . your probably refer to the mexican basin crater . mass extinction do not prove evolution . the flood as describe in the bible be an example of mass extinction . besides , in order for the asteroid theory to work , the asteroid would have to create an almost global tidal wave that would effectively kill the animal by drown . also similiar to the effect of the flood .	0
well , that depend what far fetch idea someone have i imagine . so let get this straight ; you say it be fine to pick and choose which bit of the bible you accept , but it be not okay to try revisit passage in the light of other knowledge from outside the bible ? i just ask because i find that an interesting position to adopt . if reality conflict with the bible , there be people that tend to ' reinterpret ' the bible so that to them it agree with reality . this be inexcusable in my opinion . to me , the very fact that they convince themselves that the bible say something it doesnt be bad than simply admit that the bible contradicts reality . what be the point of depend on the bible for truth when youre go to interpret it to suit something entirely contrary ? its like tell your kid that the moon be make of cheese , and then later when confront with contradictory evidence , rather than admit you lie , you tell your kid that they misinterpret what you say .	1

becuase the thread be primarily focus on the initial outbreak and spread of aid in the us , and to say there be no connection between that outbreak and spread and sexuality either demonstrate that you be either completely and totally ignorant of the fact , or you have utterly blind yourself in the name of political correctness . be this what jpsartre meant ? at any rate , to say that there be large number of gay men , be infect in the u . s . , be not say there be a connection between aid or its spread and homosexuality in itself . there be a connection when there be active sexuality , gay or straight , and aid be a sexually transmitted disease . we actually do not know who patient zero be . what be the point of say initially it affect much large number of gay men , and few heterosexual , to the best of our available knowledge ? this be a disease , and unknowingly spread it , no matter who you be , be not murder . the fact that much more transmission be initially occur in a certain group , who have sex among that group , before that group know it exist and what it be and how to prevent it ; that would also not be murder .	0

for me the reason i do not ' give it credit ' be that it ' s irrelevant - - i do not see how it matter either way way if sexual ' orientation ' be natural or not . it ' s a separate issue from the moral one . remember , it ' s natural for animal to do many thing - - some specie ' male impregnate the female and leave forever the female to raise the offsrping on it ' s own . but just because such behavior exists among animal do not make it moral in human . in fact i ' d call it immoral . there be many such example in the animal kingdom . natural do not mean it ' s automatically moral . then you would want me to be something god do not create me to be ? silly , i ' d say ! human be part of the animal kingdom . mammal if i remember from biology . be you not an animal ? if not , maybe the mothership will come and pick you up soon .	1
like i say before i would not celebrate the death of any person . even osama bin laden . there may be evil men out there but to celebrate the death of an evil man be evil as well . it go along the same line as do something evil to achieve good still make you an evil person . you would not celebrate osama be out of the picture ? maybe not throw a party , but a not even a simple `` yippee ! `` ? yeah , right . what a load .	1

look around . faith do not spontaneously generate out of thin air . it be obviously part of our psyche . every civilization throughout history have felt the need for some type of faith . even on different side of the planet . it ' s as natural as the sun rise . but what about the hypothetical ? i can not think of a single child on this planet that have never be expose to the idea of the supernatural . so , what i be ask be whether faith be nature or nurture . that ' s why i bring up kid be afraid of the dark , likely no matter what anyone tell them . i think it ' s this fear of the unknown link to the `` logical `` brain of a human that possibly create this need for explanation . but faith involves specific , so when the specific be fill in and `` make sense `` to more than one person , these specific `` explanation `` can be pass down . so i do not know how much of faith be nature and how much be nurture .	0

the interesting thing about the ' quality of life ethic ' be that , in a pro - choice framework , it mean that we can not degrade anyone ' s quality of life without their permission . so far from entail a cull of the elderly , the infirm , the handicapped , and the ugly , the quality of life ethic entail that we can not kill them off . each person be entitle to the quality of life that they desire where what they desire do not infringe on other ' s quality of life . tell this to those infant and adult in the netherlands who be be euthanized against their will . this be a logical conclusion of a quality of life ethic without a sanctity of life basis .	0

the benefit aspect can be resolve simply by petition the government to stop use the word marriage and substitute in its place the word civil union and allow any couple ( of age of consent ) to join in a civil union . right . . . but rather than remove every reference to marriage from every state and federal law and replace it with the word ' civil union ' and then extend the right to participate in a civil union to gay people and straight people alike , would not it be way easy just to , uh , let gay people get marry ? besides , if the idea of gay marriage be see as an ' attack ' on straight marriage , how exactly be the notion of remove ' marriage ' altogether go to be construe ? not as a friendly compromise , i be bet . oh yeah . way easy . which be why gay marriage have come such a long way since it start . wink marriage would only be remove from any legal document . it will still appear in religious document . the compromise will be a hell of a lot more amicable than the tension that currently exist .	1

nope , you have still miss the point . bolding your repetition will not help , either . you say ' all visit moslem ' . not ' all visit individual ' . specifically investigate ' all visit moslem ' be discriminatory . investigate ' all visiting individual ' be not - well , it be a bit , but less so - and you would not have get this response if you have suggest as such . since we be at war with radical islam and they have attack our homeland once already and have promise a repeat performance . it be ludicrous , irresponsible and suicidal to consider that investigate people of islamic descent before allow them entry to be a discriminatory policy . especially since terrorist do not fight like men but be commit only to hit and die / run sneak attack . but i be not surprised that you be blind by political correctness when you should be concern about your family security . emoticonxrolleyes	1

well for the most part dou you be flaw indeed . you see we be already fight a war . like i say we can not solve all the world problem , we just need to be there for others less fortunate than ourselves . so would not that cover almost all of africa ? there be so many people die in the city street of hunger in our own country , yet we elect a president who want to address a problem in iraq rather than our own country ? if we truly tried to help all those less fortunate than ourselves , we would be help africa a lot more than we be now ( their average life expectancy be like 30 ) . yes iraq be terrible , but guess what , other country might think our country be terrible . that be not our concern and at least we could wait until we fix all of our own problem first . we have poor hungry starve people on the street of the us and we go to another country to solve their problem ?	0

2005 publicize aid to israel be $ 5 - billion , about average for that country . that do not include $ 28 - billion in 2002 to fight terrorism , with subsequent yearly amount classify and not for publication . the us also pick up about 50 % of israel ' s ongoing deficit and trade imbalance in the form of israeli debt for israel to maintain a small positive payment balance for trade credit and public confidence purpose . pull those number from their primarily transactional gdp and problem would quickly appear cumulate with that spiral effect . over 30 % of present israeli gdp in public service be difficult to fund from domestic tax revenue , presently the high in the free world , without incur abnormal debt . israel be rid on the coattail of us elastic debt policy . make up number again georged ? care to post some link to this data ? in 2005 israel receive 2.5 billion , most of it be foreign military financing . there be some more they get though so your 5 billion might be right . as for the 28 billion in 2002 . i know that be wrong . i recall a 200 million dollar thing , but i do not know if it go through . the rest of your number be probably overstate as well . you have a bad habit of do so .	0

the criminalization of abortion be the real abuse of power . it be mostly do by a few sexist and political oppertunist member of the ama to stop woman from practice medicine and by xenophobic / racist protestant group who fear a non - white / non - protestant majority here in america after the civil war clear out many of them . so the intent hiding behind abortion law all along be to keep woman in the gutter . there be not any legititamte concern for the unborn fetus . it be all about how they could keep woman down . tell me then , would someone who support a ban on partial birth abortion do so simply because they want to repress woman ?	0

as i have mention many time in these forum , one ' s personal view of abortion ( i . e . , whether it should be prohibit or permit ) have nothing whatsoever to do with whether roe v . wade should be overturn . if one support the rule of law , then they would have to support the statement make by senator mccain . also , give that you do not like his stated position on gay marriage ( i . e . , that marriage be a state issue ) , it appear to me that you do not like democracy either . ah , so i do not like democracy , and yet it be you who in the post be tell me that i have to support mccain ' s statement . be you serious ? that sure do not sound like democracy to me . i also find it funny that you claim that i do not like democracy when my very post state that i would be vote for the democrat party . but then , i guess if we do not support bushyboy and his fellow republicanazis , we must be against democracy , right ? get real , phyllis .	1

you have obviously be tell this by a pro - choicer who will leap to any rationale no matter how shallow in order to justify his / her defense for abortion . he fail to appreciate that prevent an egg from be fertilize be not at all similar to murder a fetus which be in many case at a minimum of up to 3 month of development . hi ryuuichi , if i might defend your doctor for a second , i think i can explain his thinking . he / she understand that what you think you want at 17 yr . old might be very different than what you will want when you be in your 2 0 s and in love with your potential soul mate . at that time , when the man of your dream be real and you two actually discuss your future live together , if you then decide to get your tube tie and never have child , he will be confident that your decision be rational and base on a mutual decision with your spouse . see the difference ? to make that decision now could and probably would be greatly regret since most men you meet in your 2 0 s who fall in love with you will desire to have child with you one day . very few men would choose to marry a woman who could never give them natural child . in fact , i can say with confidence that to make such a permanent decision without include the man you will fall in love with and want to marry one day be probably the most selfish decision a woman could make . think about it as a woman in love some day and you will see my point , i be sure . emoticonxangel and have a child with a terminal disease and watch them most likely die slowly because of my `` soul mate . `` yeah . i be think if they be willing to make me go through that they be not a soul mate at all . _ 	1

i agree . these law limit magazine capacity be base on stupid assumption that be base on hollywood ( think drive by hollywood ) . the average shooting involve less than 5 round fire . so limit the capacity have no affect on crime . well , i have hear people on the pro - gun side say that most defensive gun us do not involve fire even one round . so limit the capacity would probably have less of an effect on the ability to defend yourself than on crime . so why be people from the gun lobby always whine about restriction like this ? when semi - automatic rifle be ban in australia , hunter welcome the law . they saw it as a challenge because it take great skill to shoot an animal with a bolt action rifle . not so in america where some gun owner like to use gun that could take down plane to shoot small animal .	0

evolutionist have teach for decade that the second law of thermodynamics — the entropy principle that thing naturally decrease in complexity rather than increase — pose no barrier to evolution . their claim be that while there be an overall downhill trend in nature , uphill innovation can occur locally in a system if abundant energy be available . specifically the sun ' s energy provide all that be necessary to transform inorganic chemical into a living cell and eventually into people . all that be necessary be an open system and abundant energy , especially the sun ' s energy . if complicate living organism can be create in this way , certainly something not nearly so complicate as a house could be produce . especially a solar - power house ! that ' s obviously not what be say . the sun ' s energy be not claim to be a mechanism that make order of disorder . what it do do be override the tendancy within the 2 lotd where total usable energy in a system decrease .	0

for once i find myself agree with randomdude . i have be in a church of several christian denomination and never see a ' holy ' bible that be just the nt . i have never be to a church where all the sermon be draw exclusively from the nt . and i know that most christian embrace thing like the ten commandment , which be ot all the way . the ot be a prelude , it set a backstory for the come of christ , but thing depict in it ( like original sin ) be essential to the message of jesus ; without the ot , the nt be baseless nonsense - well , more than it be already , anyways . well , i own a new testament ( only the new ) book myself . so i be really surprised that you have not see one before . but whatever . what i be say , and what random dude seem to not get , be that christianity be base on the new testament . we believe in both book . but when people ask , what be a christian ? a christian be a person who believe in jesus - jesus only exist in the new testament - therefore if the new testament do not exist , then christianity would not exist either . so that be why christianity be base ( remember the word base ) on the gospel .	0

i keep hear gay say that but every time it ' s put to a vote , you lose . i ' d say that it ' s time to try another tact because the current one be a losing proposition . the only thing force gay marriage on a population do be galvanize them against the forced action . and when they respond on the ballot , they do so punatively . just wait until you see the repercussion of the current effort to give all federal employee ' s same sex partner benny on our dime despite doma . i be guess that some additional democratic head will roll in the fall election if that fly . you need a pr strategy that highlight the advantage of gay union over bathhouse and gay bar existence . i believe that a true majority of people would support civil union but not marriage . and i count myself amongst that majority . actually jp so far 5 state have pass gay marriage so no not every time it be put to a vote do we lose . and how be i force anyone to accept gay marriage ? be i force these voter to attend my wedding or dare i say be in a marriage themselves ? and i can not agree with you more about change the image of the gay community as a whole . we be not all a bunch of promiscuous sex crazed people run around . what i find funny be once strait people find out how boring we really be , and how we pay tax just like every other joe schmo they will think nothing more of special right lol . but actually like i state earlier in another thread if those union constitute the same legal right as married couple i would be content .	0
indeed , for several decade , molecular evolutionist have rely on an evolutionary view that abandon the darwinian presumption of abundant pre - exist variation , assume instead that the rate of evolution depend directly on the rate of introduction of new allele by mutation . interesting , but it appear to ignore the fact that there be pre - exist variation ( just look at the picture ) . emphasize mutation be ok , but rely solely on them will probably skew result .	0

similarly , every mutation that have ever occur have have a definite proximate cause , and if we know what they all be and what they would all be in the future , evolution would lie map out before us in all its detail . nevertheless , in the absence of perfect knowledge of these individual cause we can still describe the occurrence of such event statistically , say how long we might have to wait , or how many trial we might conduct in order to expect a give outcome . so to say that the evolution of the nylon bug , for instance , be base on chance be mislead : the evolution of the nylon bug be base on whatever proximate cause shuffle its dna . invalid argument to assert that mutation can map a road outside of their assign task in illogical , where would the information to do so come from ? biology work because every individual cell do what it be create to do along with what the one next to it be , though create to perform another set of instruction create the molecular change that the combination of the cell together would produce . but there be no additional information there . not int he way you assert .	0

read these story of self defence and then tell me brady how you can justify thesethe injustice of the british ban on self defensemaking matter worse , the british legal system seem to treat crime victim bad than it treat the criminal who attack them . an example be the tony martin case : tony martin be a farmer , whose remote farmhouse have be break in to many time . martin feared future burglary attempt and the risk of be attack by a violent burglar . when a pair of burglar break in while he be home , martin open fire with a pump action shotgun . the 16 - year - old burglar fred barras be kill , and 33 - year - old brendon fearon be wound in the leg . later on that day , the police arrest tony martin and charge him with the crime of murder and wound with intent . at trial , martin argue that he have act in self defense , but the court find that he have fire while they be try to flee . he be convict of murder and sentence to life in prison , although the conviction be later reduce to manslaughter with a 5 year sentence . the survive criminal , who have over 30 criminal conviction , then sue tony martin for the injury he suffer during the burglary . the parole board refuse to grant tony martin an early release because he “ have show no remorse and would continue to pose a danger to any other burglar . ” martin be eventually release from prison after spend year in prison and be vilify by the anti - gun group in the uk for shoot criminal who have break into his home . another example , from 2009 , also show how the british legal system favor criminal over their victim : a millionaire businessman have be jail for attack a man who hold his family hostage in their own home – while the criminal go free . munir hussain , who be threaten at knifepoint and tie up by a gang of mask men in his living room last year , be tell he must go to prison for 30 month to preserve “ civilised society ” . but walid salem , a criminal with more than 50 conviction , be hand a two - year supervision order for his role in the break - in at an early hearing . he be one of three men who ambush mr hussain , his wife and child as they return to their home in high wycombe , buck , on sept 3 last year after attend ramadan prayer at their local mosque , read crown court heard . their hand be tie behind their back and they be force to crawl from room to room before be force to lie down in the living room . but when hussain ' s teenage son manage to escape and raise the alarm , he seize his chance and turn on his captor . . . the brother be find guilty of cause grievous bodily harm with intent by a jury in september . sentencing , judge john reddihough tell them it be his “ public duty ” to jail munir hussain for 30 month and his brother for 39 month . this one be quite nice as wellcleared : builder who chop off thug ' s ear with samurai sword after he threaten to rape and kill his family | mail onlinewell thank god for the gun ban in england . it have completely wipe out all crime mean no citizen ever need to defend themself . when the criminal have great civil protection than his victim , and this be view as be civilize , a society be doom .	0

i be just state a fact . if your delusional mind want to read more into it than that , have fun - i can not help it if you get off on that . somehow i know when i post it that your delusion would try to find some sort of way to criticize me even if i just state a simple fact . get a life , aa emoticonxbanghead emoticonxrolleyes . i love how iranian president alphabet kidnap 15 sailor and marine , hold them captive on b evidence , and then try to act like the big humanitarian on earth by ' pardon ' them out of the kindness of his heart . personally , i think it would be nice for these 15 british troop to see the bomber go the opposite direction as they leave iranian airspace .	1

just interject . several of the letter attribute to paul be not writen by his hand accord to most biblical scholar . ' most biblical scholar ' ? if you mean they think the letter be forgery and be not at least dictate by paul , then it ' s just not true that most biblical scholar think that . i agree in term of the idea that paul in some case have someone else actually put the word on paper and he tell them what to write , but that ' s pretty irrelevant here , imo .	0
i agree , it be we that it be ridicule that we have get so into control stuff that now we even have a way to control natural course , but i guess like i say before if it be to stop your child from suffer a sickness then i guess that be okay ( still bad ) but good than just be a complete control freak , or be selfish yeah ! its a benefit to be able to do a thing like that . i be amaze that we have come so far in technology and science , but i think there be a line of what we can offer people . its not like they be gon na choose whether they want to have an egg or a bagel for breakfast .	0
of course this do not show number of couple who be ' separate ' ( and possibly sleep around or with multiple people , but still legally marry to one individual . so the article be of no use in draw the aformentioned conclusion that homosexual couple be more monogamous than heterosexual one , or vice - versa . and the report data be 8 year old . anything that do not fit your preconcieved prejudice be automaticlly wrong ?	1
no more funding of these stupid war off the book . start pay for them up front just like we be suppose to do for health care for american . a surtax on the rich who be benefit from profiteer on the war in iraq and afghanistan . no surtax ? no surge . an evilly unfair burden have be put on american ' s soldier and their family , the soldier who have be deploy and redeploy and redeploy and redeploy over and over again while dick cheney make money off both war . it stink to holy hell ! the surcharge should go on gasoline from me oil use by 300 + million american daily . but wait ! that would unfairly burden the work poor that drive gas - guzzlin ' hoopdies , so scrap that idea . let us just soak the rich for the hell of it . because we can . emoticonxrolleyes	1

? they be not like puppy or chicken , can not get them fix or make bar b que out of them . reread my argument , please . i do not see incest as good or anything . what i do see be that the only real rational argument against it be the genetic trouble with offspring ( all other argument be actually problem that cause incest , not consequence of incest ) . and here , i see hipocrisy . we be prohibit incest , but be not institute a global consistent policy that would apply to any and all parent where genetic risk exist . adult heterosexual consenting non - related parent whose procreation be almost guarantee to cause genetic defect ? we leave it to them to decide and choose the preventive measure . relate ? prohibit regardless of chance . and really , i would actually fully support such a ( yes , very invasive ) globally consistent policy . the double standard annoys me , not that i advocate incest ( something people here fail to acknowledge ) .	0
the author be argue that gun control in rural area do not constitute crime control in urban area but somehow you try to spin that into make it sound as if the author be make some blanket statement against all gun control . so what if the author be not argue against gun control ? at last , there be indication that england have take a step in the right direction and realize that take all gun away from everybody be not the answer to crime .	0
supersport , do you believe in a creator that purposely doom human being to inevitable genetic destruction ? after all , if what you claim be true , human being have no choice but to ' devolve . ' yea . i ' d say we be on a downhill slide . do you agree with talkorigins that most mutation ( like 99 % ) lose information , lose specificity ? mutation be destructive entity . they demolish and break down what be there . grant some of these may be beneficial but ulitmately the gene have lose information . and since selection work on the level of the whole organism , it can not stop the loss of information on the molecular level . not only that , but natural selection have an i . q . of exactly zero - - as do random mutation - - so i believe the only way for the genome to go be downward . and if the only way for the genome to go be downward , then common sense say that neodarwinism be wrong . it ' s not just unlikely . it ' s not just improbably - - it ' s dead wrong and the whole hypothesis must be reject .	0

agree . it seem to me , in light of the number of recent child rape / murder case commit by recidivist , that simone have it backwards and those folk who have no faith in our justice system would rather see ten innocent die rather than punish one guilty person . woohoohoo , diogenes , talk about twist my statement , wow ! wow ! i be just plain flabbergasted !	1
accord to this , there be 1,531 , 764 crime stop by gun this year ( and it ' s not even the end of the year yet ! ) . it also give a reasonable explanation of why you do not see this on the news every day . it also say that legal gun owner account for almost 0 % of all gun crime . so if you want to ban gun , 1,531 , 764 people will get kill or injure , and you will only take gun out of the hand of those who do not even commit gun crime . but if you actually take time to read the study that be post on that website it appear that the claim of the nspof be doubtful , inconsistent with other study , and likely bias in favor of people answer that they have use a gun to defend themselves .	0
`` one of the gun use at columbine be a tec - 9 , a semiautomatic handgun once specifically advertise by its manufacturer as the most popular crime weapon in america . the tec - 9 be ban under president clinton ' s semiautomatic weapon order some year ago and be no longer make , but the one that be still out there can be legally sell . `` gun show and columbinesame for north hollywood . the weapon be legally buy at a gun show by an acquaintance and transfer to the shooter . the shooter then easily modify several to full - auto . so then the law be flaw because criminal could just as easily get their hand on select firearm , ban or no ban . you have just admit that the bill do nothing and thus there ' s no justification for it to be reinstate .	0

that would most likely ( imo ) reduce the number of abortion perform . it would depend , i think , on how viable it be to transfer the embryo into the artificial womb . force surgery would not be an option if i have anything to do about it . what if the surgery for transfer the embryo / fetus would be equal in difficulty , risk , etc . to have an abortion ? there would then be no extra physical cost incur in keep the embryo / fetus alive . what would be the reason , in such a case , to keep abortion as an option ?	0

all they be really press for be basically for kid parent to tell their kid at home that god guide evolution without it contrast directly with what the kid be be teach at school . personally , i see no problem with this , as long as they stick to the fact in any case . just glanmcing over the propose change , i be not see anything that be factually incorrect . but that be how creationism work - half truth . evolution be a theory but do not make it quite clear that in science the word theory do not mean half - assed guess , as it do in creationism . check out that little piece of * * * * that be add to the bottom of the pattern of cumulative change paragraph on page 7 . that be pure yec . and you be not a yec ?	1
so be it safe to say you may be for pro - ignorance ? with technology answer become clear . everything cost money . education cost money , therefore knowledge have a price tag . do you now suggest people do not go to college because it too be yet another expense . society should not be invent equipment that advance our intelligence . sonogram be great tool for understand more to those woman who have doubt . i do not know about you , but i be all for empowerment with knowledge . most people be `` visual `` people and perhaps see the unborn may make the choice clearer for the woman . i be for educate those from all perspective . most people would rather see physcial evidence that a sonogram may provide than the rhetoric of slogan and idealistic point of view . i know your kind . `` just trust me `` be your motto . you know ' my kind ' ? how very presumptuous on your part . then you know individual choice be the issue , not enforce medical procedure . you do not answer the question regard pregnant woman who intend to carry to term be require to have a sonogram .	0
in re : the jefferson claim . it ' s true that he propose castration for ' buggery . ' but . consider that colonial scientist be as ignorant of sexual orientation as the ancient israelites , it ' s not surprising they draft such a draconian punishment for homosexuality . jefferson ' s suggestion , however , be merciful by comparison . and we also know that , have revise the bible by edit out all the supernatural event ( include , especially , the resurrection ) and have refer to paul ( author of the nt ' s allegedly anti - homosexual ' clobber ' passage ) as ' the great coryphaeus . the first corruptor of the doctrine of jesus , ' that he would likely have be repel by with archangel ' s view , on both god and homosexuality . in fact , it ' s probable , give his devotion to science and reason , that have he know then what our doctor and scientist know now about human sexuality he likely would not have go so far as condone so harsh an alternative as castration . exactly who be you say have revise the bible ? and with that question ask , i believe by admit that if it be revise to delete the meat of it , it would be equally dilute in power , content and strength . really ? if you be speak about jefferson still , then why do not he recommend that all punishment for homosexuality be erase from the law completely , and homosexuality be legalize at that time ? that would have be the just and magnanimous thing to do if he believe such tripe as you attribute to him .	0

for anti - choicers , it ' s just about control and power over woman . they do not care about life .

so be you be say that because she want an abortion she should have it ? then why be you even against abortion ? we be talk about a life here not just a fetus . i believe that everyone have a right to live . no fetus should pay the consequence because of a decision make by it ' s mother . in the year 2000 , there be 1.3 million fetus that be kill and the same amount of family be wait for child to adopt . if you be say that nothing be wrong if a woman need an abortion , the you be say she can have repeat abortion . what if a woman who have unprotected sex and know the consequence of her action but later decide she want an abortion ? what be your opinion on that ? i think so too . every father should have a right to have a say when it come to an abortion because that fetus be form from their chromosome and genetics . i be surprise that advocate for abortion be say that men have no right to tell a woman how to control her body but yet they do not have a problem with the decision of the u . s supreme court in which all of the judge be men .	0

there be nothing at all absurd about this take . the gay agenda have be to normalize homosexuality and what good way to do it than to indoctrinate the young and desensitize them to the negative of the lifestyle while they be still impressionable . that way they know that within 20 year they will have normalize this abnormal lifestyle . you forget about the youth recruitment effort as well . i be president of the local chapter of `` get ' em while they be young . `` our mission ( agenda , if you will ) be to recruit and convert the kid in an effort to increase the prevalence of homosexuality to 20 % by 2015 , then 51 % by mid - century when we will have total control , muahahahahaha ! 	1

a human life be only a person once there be someone exist there . before a fetus have a mental existence , it be just a grow human body - a thing , not a person . a thing can not suffer , can not feel pain , fear or even feel anything for that matter . how can you have empathy for a thing ? once a fetus develop a mental existence , then it be a person worthy of protection , as be all people . in that case a man in a coma be not a person then , be he ?	1
the fossil record do not support this . so , in an attempt to deal with this problem , gould and eldredge come up with a theory call , punctuate equilibrium . actually , the fossil record do support it . both eldredge and gould have discuss it . both men make observation of slow gradual speciation in the fossil record in a small geographical area . these change be reflect at other location as an abrupt change from one specie to another . but give that such change take place very quickly in population that be usually under environmental stress and isolate from the main population , and give the rarity of fossilization in the first place , we do not expect to find many example in the fossil record . it be a bit like try to time a 100 yd . dash with a sundial . the fossil record just be not fine grain enough to see the rapid ( 50 - 60 thousand year ) change .	0

i think this might be the wrong thread for this discussion . something like this belongs in the crime debate area , where i be currently hand jo his head over and over again . you lie . you keep say the same thing over and over again , that do not make them true . your addiction to violence be show . tony martin shoot an unarmed 16 year old kid in the back as he be run away . that ' s not self - defence , that ' s cold blood murder . it be not the role of individual to exact revenge for crime commit against them . you do not get to take the law into your own hand . munir hussain run after the intruder and beat them up with a cricket bat in the street . that ' s not self - defence , that ' s revenge .	0

that ' s a matter of interpretation , ' god ' s spirit move over the water ' be in the old testament . the holy spirit be refer to repeatedly by jesus in the gospel , and the working of the spirit be a central theme in act and paul ' s letter . in what passages do jesus refer to his junior partner ? i be not say he do not , rather , i be not recall off the top of my head any specific mention of the holy ghost by jesus .	0
i honestly think israel would be the one to bear the brunt of all out war with iran . their zeal be unmatched as a fight force and their simply one of the best period . oh and do you know they allow gay to serve openly in their military ? guess old mccain miss that memo too . i do not know that , but i be not surprise by it . israel need all the soldier it can get . and i disagree with you on the iran war issue . all out war with iran will have the israeli sit on the sideline yet again so as not to x off the me ally fight against iran .	0

if i can not question and receive specific i do not consider it a fact . you can read all the book , cruise all the website . but indeed they be just other people opinion . show me the documented proof ! so everything that other people say on a website or in a book be just and opinion ? and everything you say be a fact ? nice how you have get thing set up .	1
the proof be in the pudding . i suggest that you read my post again and let me know if you disagree with any of my opinion . if not , then you have to come to the conclusion that god do not exsist . god ' s only exsistance in the mind of believer just as be the case with believer of different god throughout human history . i do not understand what you be refer to when you say , `` just admit you be a faith base preacher , as bad as any fundamentalist `` ? by the way it should be ovious that i be an atheist . symbiote seem to have have a large hair across his butt .	1
i have see some claim that the dems be go to get trash at the midterm , and to a certain extent they deserve it give how half - arsed and bloodless the healthcare bill be , but be there anyone who vote democratic in november 08 who will now be vote republican in november 10 ? it seem to me that the people who be oppose to the healthcare bill be those who oppose obama in the first place . i be not convinced it ' s go to make that much difference on its own . i do not vote for a republican or a democrat in 2008 and in 2010 it do not matter because my rep be not challenge .	0
i do not think this approach be all that new , but i have to admit that i have not be around as many of the old - school creationists . i have be around the creationist / science discussion for a number of year , about 20 or so . the `` you believe in evolution `` argument have be around for at least that long . in my experience it have be a waste of breath to try to convince creationists that i do not believe in evolution any more than they do . as i recall , the argument be even present in a court case back in the late 6 0 s , or maybe it be the early 8 0 s . i could be wrong . i will have to check on that .	0
so far there be no mechanism for an organism to grow wing when it previously have none . i know this may seem obvious to most people , but it seem to have escape the notice of creationists . bird be tetrapod , as be amphibian , reptile , and mammal . bird do not just grow wing . wing be adaption of the front limbs that be cover with feather . perhaps you be unaware of the evidence that indicate that maniraptor have feather , probably for thermoregulation . say that there be no mechanism for bird to grow wing when they previously have none be like say that there be no mechanism for mankind to grow arm when he previously have none . you see , mankind ' s closest relative be the two specie of chimpanzee - they be quadruped .	1

and you just sound ignorant . you would not make this statement if you know about how britain ' s current gun control law come into existence . you / he could just have say ' slippery slope ' in the first place ; that argument be an old one , which i though be deal with a long time ago . you can not disapprove of a on the ground that it might lead to b - firstly because you have little to no evidence that it will , secondly because a be not necessary for b to happen and thirdly because that difference between a and b be all the argument you need to prevent b but be in favour of a . you can approve of punish criminal but be against the death sentance .	0

but that simply be not the case . science class be for science , and any school receive government funding should use it to promote real science , which be think . until intelligent design can come up with evidence , as well as any potential advantage to the science community to id , it will be nothing but a religious belief . and religion do not belong in the science class any more than politics do . a completely different subject which have it ' s merit , but not as real science . it can not come up with evidence if it ' s suppress from future generation . until you can show that happenstance origin be science , you have no basis to declare that intelligent design be not science . i agree that i have not show how id have a potential advantage to the political corruptness of today ' s scientific community , but i have show it ' s potential advantage to our society . i have show how thinking be involve with it , the type of think involve in any school class involve philosophy , which you say science class should have .	0

other ape can also be teach these same concept - to a more limited degree , sure , but then the related part of their brain be small and less capable . yes peeling ; you say this with such assurance , yet what you can not explain with any assurance be why only one offshoot of the primate genus evolve into what human being be today . why only us , when we all allegedly start in the same environment with the same ecosystems put the same pressure on us . what i be say be that in every place where our alleged primate ancestor fossil have be find , so have not the fossil of animal describe as low primate be find . so your explanation that one specie evolve while another stagnate or die out ring hollow with me . especially since you can actually prove absolutely none of this . can not you see that peel ? none of this be provable .	0
as i say , you do not have a clue . you be so wrong . these be quote from origin of specie . i doubt they will help you , but at least you will have the straight information for your denial . so the `` origin of specie `` have more information for theistic evolutionist than the bible do ? do theistic evolution believe in satan ?	1

the record already acquire be amazingly good . it provide us with many detailed example of a great variety of evolutionary phenomenon on low and intermediate level and rather abundant data that can be use either by controlled extrapolation or on a statistical sampling basis for inference as to phenomena on all level up to the high . among the example be many in which , beyond the slight doubt , a specie or a genus have be gradually transform into another . such gradual transformation be also fairly well exemplify for subfamily and occasionally for family , as the group be commonly rank . in spite of these example , it remain true , as every paleontologist know , that most new specie , genus , and family appear in the record suddenly and be not lead up to by know , gradual , completely continuous transitional sequence . george gaylord simpson , the major feature of evolution ( new york : columbia university press , 1961 ) , pp 359 - 60 . notice that even in this version there be elipses just before the quote in question . my bet be if we be to actually refer to this 44 year old book , simpson would not be say what toxey want him to say .	0

science will never be able to disprove any god because of some flaw science happen to point out . the best individual can do be , when people try to reason that such perfect organ imply a designer , point out that the design be not all that perfect after all . exactly . try to prove that god , if he exist , do not make us as good as an all powerful be should have make us do not prove anything in the god debate . i could always debate that since god be all powerful and all knowing he could have always think of something well to do . if he make those change , then of course there would still be something well he could have think of . this would be an endless loop of create something well and good until finally he would have to stop and say that be good enough . but even then this debate that he do not make us as good as he could have would be valid in my view .	0
go do your own homework . i be not bust my butt for a certified christ - denier who never admit anything when information be provide . figure it all out yourself . i already have , hence the explanation i provide . if you challenge me to show you an error then i will . do you expect me to try and show something that be true and see if i could convince you it wasn ' t ? when you post your evidence it usually have hole in it , not always but the truth be funny that way . it be very difficult sometimes to cover it up . and stay away from those shrimp , eagle , gay and snowmenthey be all abomination .	1

 how often do you see people change their mind base on somebody fight for `` gay right `` ? i have see it , but it ' s only a handful of time . out of hundred of people i have talk to , it ' s only a `` handful of time `` . suppose democrat do pick up the gay banner hard and heavy . full gusto . what ' s the effect ? i seriously expect minimal . this be go to be a battle over time . gay get sodomy law overturn , and the reaction be anti - gay marriage law and amendment . the simple thing , that should have be the most obvious to everyone , of sodomy law overturn get a `` anti - gay marriage law / amendment `` reaction . these fight be be pick and choose . roflmao ! no . we fundamentally disagree there . how long have you be argue the gay marriage issue . and you state that you support equality on every issue with only the gay marriage hold - out , right ? if your mind can not be change in all that time , why do you think that we could win over the nation just by have democrat come out hot and heavy . furthermore , think about it . how long have we be push for enda . and we just try the vote , and it fail . even on the issue that have overwhelming majority support , the anti - gay be able to stop the win . what do you think will happen on an issue we do not have majority support on ? well , all i can say then be that no action be just about as bad as failed action , and be as bad in term of anything current . either way you do not have gay marriage . you have a majority in congress right now , and you be not demand much change just because of fear of backlash ? yeah , there would be backlash . heck , the civil war be the ultimate backlash , but that do not stop abolitionist from demand more than token change , and it ' s a good thing they do . it ' s your gig , though , so do what you want . i do not see much point in labor this discussion any more ; i be just point out my observation .	0
i think we should go to war with iraq . we know they have weopons of mass destruction . he have 16 - 17 weapon of mass destruction , this violate code 1441 . some people do not want to go to war because they do not like it . no one like war but you get to do what you get to do . others ( even though they wont admit it ) do not want to go to war just because bush say we need to . theyll do anything to rebel against bush . bin laden say on that tape that muslim should support iraq . why ? iraq be secular . he should not want iraq to be support . he hat non - muslim . hmm . thistown , who care what people think ? it ' s a bad idea to set foreign policy by opinion poll . 85 % of our population be oppose to enter ww ii before pearl harbor while hitler be kill million , and we know all about it . that be the wrong thing to do . i bet the chancellor be relax with a cool glass of french wine wait for his term to end . his people hate him . he ' s hold his stance to gain popularity , play politics . our president blow him off , he ' s kill relation , and he know it .	0

this be a major defeat for the pastafarian movement and the church of the fly spaghetti monster . if intelligent design creationism can not be teach in public school science class , then there ' s little hope for fsmism to be teach as an alternative . all we want be a little balance between science and faith and for that balance to be initially manifest from the bottom up , not from the top down , which have be the case ever since the materialist and athiests . . . . the athiest materialist for some time to come . . . . well , there ' s still kansas . aw shuck ! and i reckon in kansa they will not ever care whether or not you learn how to spell atheist .	1

all we want be for the baby in the womb to have the same chance you do if possible . so if jitobear ' s mother have the option to abort jitobear in utero , you want jitobear to have the same option with any child she carry ? that ' s awfully progressive of you .	1

how can you think that a baby that be not bear yet a nonentity ? yeah im only 15 and yet i know that what `` abortionist ' s `` say be a load of * * * * ! i feel sorry for you when i get old because im determine with all my heart to stop abortion ! i believe god put me on this earth to stop you people from kill his creation ! hear my word i hate liberal and i will never change my mind about abortion . i try to love everyone but it ' s hard for me to love somebody who kill an innocent child . i be pro life ! so you be pro - life and you hate liberal ? actually republican be be liberal in this case ( liberal = big government , more law ) . but i will assume you mean democrat on this . what if the baby be a democrat ? if it ' s a democratic parent it ' s most likely it will grow up democratic and one more person to attempt to keep abortion legal .	1
blah , blah , blah . so you find play word game more edify than speak out against homophobia . or homophobic action , as you seem to prefer . you may find that some people find that preference a reason to question your commitment to gay right .

so we have , in order of humility : agnosticism : do not know , can not know . but i have my opinion . note : many religious people and humanist alike fit into this category . theism : probably can not know , but do not realize it . my `` heart / soul / essence / whatever `` tell me it be truth . note : often impossible to reason with . no scientifically measurable way to prove position . atheism : can not know , but think and say otherwise . note : usually angry . no scientifically measurable way to prove position . you have do a marvelous job knock down strawman of your own construction . have offer a naive and superficial caricature of atheism , agnosticism , and theism , you then imagine a self - serve hierarchy that be , in a word , worthless - all in a silly effort to show yourself most humble . ironic .	0
you do have a good point . however , it do not change my mind . we do our best to make car as safe as we can , but so many people need to travel fast just to work and survive . more importantly , when one get into a car , they know that they run the risk of crash . i do my best to make my house as safe as i can . firearm possession be one of the mean to attain that safety . when the criminal break into a home that criminal know that he run a risk of earn a chalk outline . remove the firearm and remove the risk to the criminal . consequently , ye increase the risk to the homeowner . but be the gun that you keep in your home a great risk to yourself or to a potential intruder ? it ' s pretty easy to find information on the fbi and the cdc websites that show that more people die in gun accident than criminal die in legally justifiable self defense shooting . people defend gun often only look at the gross benefit of gun ownership , not the net benefit when it come to safety . that would make about as much sense as only look at your gross income while ignore the fact that your net income be negative .	0

i be aware of that . i be just have trouble reconcile the idea of remove a fundamental right base on a misdemeanor conviction and be wonder if there be similar precedent elsewhere . could it be that the supreme court do not view the right protect by the second amendment as be fundamental ? this be the same court that say that only gun in common use be protect by the second amendment . that tell me the supreme court do not think the right to bear arm be as fundamental as other right protect by the bill of right . the protection of a newspaper by freedom of the press do not depend on the newspaper be in common use .	0

i would like to address the theory of evolution point - by - point . since i do not want to misrepresent the theory , i have use an explanation of darwin ' s theory from gould ' s book , `` full house . `` on page 138 , gould state : 1 ) all organisms tend to produce more offspring than can possibly survive . 2 ) offspring vary among themselves , and be not carbon copy of an immutable type . 3 ) this variation be pass down by inheritance to future generation . ( we know that black folk have black kid ; white folk , white kid ; tall parent tend to have tall child ; and so on . ) 4 ) if many offspring must die ( for not all can be accommodate in nature ' s limit ecology ) , and individual in all specie vary among themselves , then on average survivor will tend to be those individual with variation that be fortuitously best suit to change local environment . since heredity exists , the offspring of survivor will tend to resemble their successful parent . the accumulation of these favorable variant through time will produce evolutionary change . a fairly good explanation , tone down a bit from darwin ' s explanation ( for the average person who do not have a phd in biology ) .	0

the enumeration in the constitution , of certain right , shall not be construe to deny or disparage others retain by the people . right retain by the peopleaside from contend that a bill of right be unnecessary , the federalist respond to those oppose ratification of the constitution because of the lack of a declaration of fundamental right by argue that inasmuch as it would be impossible to list all right it would be dangerous to list some because there would be those who would seize on the absence of the omitted right to assert that government be unrestrained as to those . 1 madison advert to this argument in present his propose amendment to the house of representative . ' ' it have be object also against a bill of right , that , by enumerate particular exception to the grant of power , it would disparage those right which be not place in that enumeration ; and it might follow by implication , that those right which be not single out , be intend to be assign into the hand of the general government , and be consequently insecure . this be one of the most plausible argument i have ever hear against the admission of a bill of right into this system ; but , i conceive , that it may be guard against . i have attempt it , as gentleman may see by turn to the last clause of the fourth resolution . ' ' 2 it be clear from its text and from madison ' s statement that the amendment state but a rule of construction , make clear that a bill of right might not by implication be take to increase the power of the national government in area not enumerate , and that it do not contain within itself any guarantee of a right or a proscription of an infringement . 3 recently , however , the amendment have be construe to be positive affirmation of the existence of right which be not enumerate but which be nonetheless protect by other provision . the purpose of the bill of right . preamble to the bill of right	0
i support legalization of every drug . i be sure most of you be young and have be feed x like `` marijuana will kill you . `` actually it do less damage to the brain then alcohol and it can not kill you . it be impossible . it take 20,000 joint in one sit to overdose on marijuana . alcohol however kill thousand of american each year from alcohol poisoning . you know that idiot pothead . he do not get dumb from pot , he get dumb from birth . marijuana do not have long term effect on iq . the only side effect be the lazy side effect . the day after a person tend to be more lazy however it be like a hang over . it only last for a day . there be no reason why it should remain illegal . i also support all drug be legalize because the drug war have fail . we spend billion each year on the drug war and i can call someone right now and pick up some crack . it be a failure . what we should do be make it government control and then spend the money to fight drug on drug education . flood the school with actual info about how herion kill and how it break a person down . tell the kid how you can die from one use of coke . tell them the short term and long term effect of each drug . if we can educate our kid and even adult through an ad campaign about what drug do to you then we could save far more people . also allow drug to be regulate will lower the price and effectively kill drug dealer and gang off the street . there be so many benefit to legalize drug . anyone want to fight it ? i have proof to back up what i say and also have the effect of each drug . recent study apparently show that pot be more harmful than you say . one joint be say to contain more carcinogen than four tobacco cigarette . i doubt your 20,000 joint theory . you have a simplistic argument go for pot . i can not agree that legalize all drug would be a good thing either . program in holland have fail to produce significant if any benefit to society in general . the druggies seem to have benefit by have arrest - free drug zone and access to whatever they want , but the cost of drug still require some income , something that most of them likely do not have other than from crime , beg or social program . one `` benefit `` i see from legalize drug be that the user could be more easily identify .	0

nfa , not nra - but your point remain . ' to his credit / discredit ' be largely irrelevant to my point , however - i wasn ' t attempt to insult his personality . however , the fact that he represent the nfa strongly imply that he have a pro - gun bias ; something which should definitely be consider when read an opinion piece , which the op be an example of . when someone say ' there be no convincing evidence for x ' , you have to look at what bias they may have about x which might cause them to set their requirement for ' convince ' to be high - or low ! - than a less biased author would . well can you point to an instance , either in canada or the united kingdom , where the government mandate firearm registry have be instrumental in solve any number of vicious and felonious crime ? i be not talk about catch people who let their registration lapse , or those who tell their spouse about the location of their gun locker key , i be talk about serious crime like murder and robbery and others . can you provide us with any evidence that would point to how the registry have help solve any such happening ?	0

that ' s a false analogy . people who be sexually attract to child harm child , and harm someone be a crime . homosexual do no harm to anyone , and be nothing like pedophile . and for someone who do not tolerate government intrusion , you sure seem to like government intrusion when it come to interfere with marriage . huh ? be we talk about gay or fornicator ? fornicator be someone who have sex before marriage and gay be a man who be attract to a man in the same way a straight man be attract to a woman . let stay on topic . i dont need a sex lesson from a little boy . once again you miss the point ( get to be a habit ) . we be talk about behaviour that be condemn by the preacher , one of which be adultery . not fornicate but i be sure the preacher would condemn that too if you read the link you would know . if homosexuality be condemn by god then they can not marry in god eye . keep up ? if gay can not marry then gay sex must be outside of marriage therefore it be fornicate . you really should try to use your little head more .

anyone who look at this situation logically should realize that at sometime in the past there must have be a time when there be less genetic damage in the genome . – and thus , long life . can anyone think of time that this may have happen ? i can ! the bible report there be a time in the history of human that lifespan be incredibly long . accord to genesis people live to over 900 year old . accord to genesis ? why be you try to present that as scientific evidence ? should i present the davinci code as scientific evidence ? how about darwin ' s on the origin of the specie ?	1
often , this debate become dot with example of thing like human vegetable who might come out of their coma as potential people who be not really people , or a person who be knock out in a brawl as a potential person who be not ( on some level ) currently a person , and many other example . we often believe it be immoral to kill people in these condition , so the potentiality argument say that a fetus be just as sacred and require our protection . there be never a question of `` kill people `` in such circumstance , it a matter of decide if treatment should be withdraw and thus allow them to die , i . e . where there be no possibility of any sort of a recovery .	0

those who do not have god as their moral compass be the one who be responsible for 99 % of crime commit to humanity . what be you talk about ? except for communist i can not think of any crime commit by atheist . as for crime commit by people who believe in god ? pick a war . seriously , pick any war before communism come about and most war after it and you will see that in every case the leader of that nation and nearly the entire population of that nation believe in god . honestly you may deserve a prize for have create the most demonstrably wrong statement on this site . congrats ! wow . just because people believe in god or claim so do not mean they have or use god as their moral compass . the god , i assume we be talk about the christian god , do not promote war and if we be to actualy follow what this god teach and use god as our moral compass we would not go to war , but most people do not follow god as their moral compass and thus do go to war .	0
18 - 19 year old anyway . it ' s still illegal for over the counter under the age of 18 . wait a minute , i fail to see how it not be availible will affect teenager do it or not . it will not . i ' d think any responsible parent with a teen under the age of 18 who have a sound relationship with that teen would discuss the possibility of her become sexually active ( a normal function in spite of some puritan attitude ) and offer simple avoidance of possible pregnancy and abortion . like vehicle insurance she may never need it , but go without either one be plain stupid .	0

you have demonstrate my point . you seem capable of respond to issue in only two way - either quote the bible as ' proof ' of something , or paste in some tedious , non - reputable and peripherally related quote . i say your interaction be not honest because you persist in these diversion , instead of directly answer with idea that come out of your mind . certainly a discussion of religion may involve the bible , but it do not always have to . you be incapable of understand that a bible quote be not proof of anything other prove those word be in the bible .

i do not think any man should ever be legally require to pay child support . if a man choose not to be a part of his child life , than thats it . do and do . just because a man pay support do not mean he be part of the child life . he have no obligation to do fatherly thing with his child . woman pay child support btw .	0
problem be that the right to marry be not a clear constitutional right . it be a right that have be interpret by court on an illegitimate legal theory know as substantive due process . i see - - in your opinion be it be `` illegitimate `` , therefore it must be so . i think i trust the legal opinion of the court more , but then , they do occasionally make mistake . it ' s just not at all obvious they have make one in this instance .	1
as far as i can see , evolutionist agree that natural selection be how we have evolve for microscopic life form . to me this mean that a single organism in a specie mutate , give it and its offspring an advantage over the rest of the population . if this mutation be random do not that mean that the gene pool for every specie would be very small as , in the long run , only the offspring of the mutated specie would survive ? in some case yes , in others no . if the mutation give a huge advantage , then there will be a decline in the size of the gene pool for a while ( eg when the australian rabbit population be reduce form 500 million to 100 million by myxomatosis , the gene pool strunk as a result and the genetic `` mutation `` that give increase resistance spread throughout the whole population as a result ) . most of the time though single mutation do not have such a huge advantage and so genetic variation be maintain .	0
however one thing that work against evolution be this . it be just amazing that every creature on this planet do not evolve to use the sun as a source of energy and food in some way or another . almost all do . in fact , probably all that you be aware of do . even the energy in the steak that you eat come from the sun ultimately . the thing be that evolution seem to have result in an organism to take advantage of almost every form of available energy . and what energy be leave by `` high `` animal be use by others - insect , microbes - until there be little usable energy leave . that even go so far that there be some organism that get their energy from geothermal source - no light involve .	0
3 ) there ' s no evidence for the big bangsadly , yes , i have actually see this one fairly often . i have no idea where people get the idea that scientist make thing up without have good evidence behind it ( oh wait … we be out to disprove god because all scientist hate god or some x like that ) . now everyone will know marc be right all along - - that there be an atheist science conspiracy .	0
an intelligent designer would design a system to produce the product as easily as possible . with regard to this statement you have to consider : 1 . how can anyone know what product an `` intelligent designer `` want . 2 . even from the example of life on earth we can clearly see there be nothing easy at all about the path life have take over the millenia . but i think it be possible to hold your position , although it can be a tricky one by virtue of the entrenchment of opinion that have occur in the religion science debate - due to the less than pragmatic attiudes of some of the participant .	0
no benefit for lay - off religious worker - upi . com another example of religion get special perk that they should not have . and unfortunately , somebody else get bit in the end . i find it difficult to believe that the religious organization do not realize they be not pay unemployment tax . emoticonxrolleyes when they be busy not pay tax , do they think that be a tax that they be somehow pay ? it sound like at least some religious organization recognize the impact of their not pay tax upon others , and take the responsible route to ensure that they as employer do right by their employee ( e . g . catholic diocese of richmond ) . these people should not have to needlessly suffer such an unexpected financial loss , but in the end it ' s the church that be to blame . they have be enjoy a benefit in not have to pay this tax , and now it ' s somebody else who suffers . i be very surprised to learn that religious institution be exempt from the normal taxation associate with have employee .	0
hence why i state so . the problem be that you be a x who can not understand what people write . this have be proven numerous time . oh i understand plenty . what you want be a system where a person be hold responsible for crime that they do not commit . you want `` guilty by association `` extend to the point of ridiculousness where anybody who even meet the criminal even once can be hold as an accomplice .	1

then there be little chance of consensus because other group or religion come up with other arbitrary set of rule and we be back to the situation of , in the bad case , chaos and , in the best case , a majority impose arbitrary rule on an unwilling suffering minority . but pro - lifer often base the pro - life stance on prevent harm . not just religion . ( and in this case they be one - in - the - same anyway . ) this be not a case of harm - preventative - morality versus religious - morality ; it ' s a case of two harm - preventative morality in conflict , due to each only focus mostly on one aspect ( either the mother or the unborn baby ) .	0

i will not throw my idea on abortion out there just yet , but i have to ask this question . should father have to pay child support consider a mother could have mitigate the expense by have an abortion ? for example : jack be 55 and make 20,000 a year . jack get injure by bob , and can no longer work unless he get a $ 1000 operation . jack ' s religion or other view preclude get the operation , so he sue bob for $ 200,000 , the wage he will lose over the next ten year . since jack could mitigate his loss by have the operation , nost likely all he will be entitle to be $ 1000 . so - should not child support be limit to the cost of an abortion , under our current pro - abortion law ? this be more of a legal question involve whether or not it be negligence ( sp ) . if so , you can not really sue for amount of money you might get in the future . he could sue for lost pay on the job and other medicial procedure . so ya know happy . i do not really know what the question be .	0

people make definition . they then make statement that make sense accord to those defintions . you interept their statement term of your own defintions . maybe your definition be in a sense well but many people adopt the position that when someone define thing you interept them use their defintions and their defintions alone . you do not seem to think this should be do . this be the main reason why people treat you the way they do . it actually have little to do with them practice objectivism or scientism . for one to have evolution as their foundation belief , mean that one can not be certian of anything . 	1

how should i respond to come back after some time to be immediately call chisler , con artist , stupid ? nevermind my observation that leave to your own device , day go by where you either follow up your own post or pat each other on the back as you regurtitate can anti - gun control rhetoric . i call them as i see them . you might recall that initially you pro - gun guy reject even the suugestion that american semi - auto would be of any interest to the cartel when they could get full auto on the black market . how then do you attribute the fact that 70 % of the rifle seize in reynoso last november , the big single seizure to date , trace to the us ? that ' s why i post that story . that ' s my question for you guy . apparently they have some use for semi - auto afterall . i love how you be pro - choice until its a choice you do not like . let people carry gun in their own home . let them carry it on their person . it have nothing to do with you do it not ? unless you deal with people threaten you with gun on a daily basis it do not . their house annoy = their choice , her body = her choice ? i love hypocrisy .	1

i be sorry but the baby be a part of both of them . should it be that the mother decide to keep the baby and the father want ' s her to terminate the state will still come chase for child support . why the father do not get a say on if the baby be bear or not so why should he have to pay child supportbecause the law say so . what the father want be ultimately irrelevent . it ' s the woman ' s body that carry the fetus . it ultimately the woman ' s decision . as wrong as that may seem to you , it be the reality . if we , as a society , would just address the issue of unwanted pregnancy , then we , as a society , will resolve the isse of abortion .	0
( play devil ' s advocate ) and , by what authority would you deny a woman ' s `` right to choose `` an abortion that happen to be `` late in her pregnancy ? `` thats a very good question . to be honest - i would prefer no legislation period - but i would not get up in arm about a late term restriction like i describe because 1 ) a fetus could very well survive outside of the mom at that point , 2 ) most reputable doctor will not conduct an abortion at that stage without a legitimate medical reason anyway .	0

as theorize , the concept of evolution be analogous to slow morphing , rather than quick abrupt change in a specie . morph ! , as can be do with computer graphic program design by intelligent being . evolution implies specie go through a process of advantagous and purposful change - - but morph be accomplish by unintelligent random process , or at least that ' s how the story go - - the created universe and life be random event . i have be patiently wait for many year but to date have never see or hear of any specie morph into another specie . i be aware of genetic defect that limit specie but unaware of mutation that perpetuate new specie . clearly variation within specie be possible and have be observe , such as poodle and great dane , but they remain member of the same specie . mankind have thousand of year of write history and i be unaware of anyone observe specie morphation ( be that a word ? ) . although it be approach 200 year after darwin hypothesise how specie might have originate , we be no close to observe a specie morph than darwin . human attempt to create new specie , such as breed donkey with horse to get mule and lion with tiger to get liger , but these `` new `` specie be almost always bear sterile and unable to perpetuate themselves . besides observe it , the way to demonstrate evolution be to manipulate a specie until it develop into a new specie , but ala , then all you will have prove be direct effort of intelligent being create specie . hmm , wonder what intelligent be ( s ) create us ? i would suggest you look at the faero island mouse then . that be a new specie , and it be not man do it , but rather nature itself .	0

asahi . com ? unload rifle on tv trigger controversy - englishotsu , shiga prefecture - - give this nation ' s strict gun control law , be police overreact when they swoop on a tv broadcaster that have allow a celebrity to handle a hunting rifle during a live broadcast ? the shiga prefectural police insist they be perfectly within their right , but tv network be outrage , cite the fact the weapon be not load . the incident stem from a show air jan . 17 by biwako broadcast co . almost four month later , police mount a search of the premise and confiscate a dozen item , include a script and a dvd of the show . critic accuse the police of be overzealous and question their motif , but law enforcement official remain unrepentant . shiga prefectural police regard the incident , in which a hunter with a gun permit allow tv personality noburo harada , 57 , to momentarily handle the rifle during the show , as a serious breach of a law concern the storage and management of firearm . so much so , in fact , that on june 12 , the prefectural police refer the case to prosecutor . as a result , the hunter , age 49 , along with a 60 - year - old tv producer and a 37 - year - old director of the show , could face charge of violate the sword and firearm control law . police do not pursue a case against harada even though he briefly handle the weapon . police argue that he do not actually `` possess `` the rifle because the hunter hand it to him in an unscripted moment during the broadcast . police justify their search on ground that they need to determine if the law concern the storage and management of firearm have be break . the show , call `` tokimeki shiga ' s , `` be broadcast one saturday a month . in the show , harada visit various location in the prefecture as a travel guide . the program in question be set in yogo , where harada and other cast member be serve a pot of wild boar meat . the hunter who have kill the boar appear in the scene . he offer the unloaded weapon to harada and ask , `` do you want to hold it ? `` harada hold the rifle and comment , `` it ' s heavy , be not it ? `` add , `` not everybody have a chance to hold it , right ? `` he hold the firearm for six second and then give it back . biwako broadcasting say the scene in which the hunter hand over the rifle be not in the script and be improvise . the tv crew decide to display the rifle on the show after the hunter tell the director he have no problem with the idea at a preliminary meeting . the prefectural police begin their investigation after a complaint by a viewer . the intervention by the police flabbergast harada and employee of other tv station . `` i never could have imagine anything like this , `` harada , a former member of the male comedy duo anonenone , tell reporter after he be question by police on june 2 . `` i be stun . `` akihiko ito , head of the tv station ' s programming department , say the station would cooperate with police , but defend harada ' s action . `` we consult our lawyer , and it be hard to believe that touch a rifle for about six second be equivalent to possess it , `` he say . a spokesperson with a tv station base in osaka sharply criticize police . `` they should have at least ask ( biwako broadcast ) to cooperate voluntarily , `` a spokesperson say . `` from a common sense standpoint , we can not even comprehend what the police be think . `` an employee at another tv station be also critical . `` if we , for example , be to produce a program about a knife shop and an actor pick up a large knife , would the police investigate us , too ? `` the employee ask . `` such an overreaction would be intimidate toward people try to do their job . this would ultimately undermine viewer interest in program . `` but police say they do not understand what all the fuss be about . they say the medium have , by focus on the celebrity angle , blur the fact in the case . a senior official with the shiga prefectural police say the real issue be not that harada briefly hold the rifle , but whether bring the rifle to the live broadcast be appropriate in term of `` storage and management . `` an explanation for the police tactic may lie in the revised gun control law , which take effect in january . the law be tighten after a 37 - year - old man in sasebo , nagasaki prefecture , shot and kill two people and wound six in december 2007 . the man , know for erratic behavior , commit suicide after the shooting . the incident call into question whether exist regulation regard gun permit and firearm storage be adequate . `` i believe the hunter who hand the rifle to the actor and the tv crew lack an awareness of the firearm ' s potential danger , `` another police official say . accord to the national police agency , police can file a case against anybody if he or she , with criminal intent to kill or injure people , possess a weapon for even a second . a case can be build base not on the length of time of possession , but on the purpose of possession , the presence of criminal intent and whether the suspect trick or maneuver the gun owner . the shiga prefectural police justify the raid on the ground that they have to find out how it be possible to bring a gun to the show . by transport the gun to the show , the hunter may have violate the rule under which he be grant a gun permit , police assert . they defend question harada and the crew as crucial to ferret out the real issue - - do those involve in the program improperly store and manage the weapon ? takaaki hattori , professor of medium law at rikkyo university in tokyo , say that police go too far . `` the way the police conduct their investigation be not convincing . i sense they be try to use the medium to sell the public on the revise gun control law , `` he say . `` they should have be more cautious about the exercise of power by public authority . `` but he also say the broadcaster could have be more prudent . `` the tv station should consider whether it be absolutely necessary to use a gun in make the show . the gun owner may have be primarily responsible , but the broadcaster be also to blame for lack awareness of the law . `` takaaki matsumiya , professor of criminal law at ritsumeikan university school of law in kyoto , disagree that the tv station or the hunter be in any way culpable and lay the blame on the authority . cite a precedent set by the tokyo high court in june 1967 , he say : `` the high court decide that the act of touch a handgun for dozen of second by a man broker the sale of a handgun during the transfer do not constitute ' possession , ' `` he say . `` there have be no precedent to alter that interpretation . harada do not ' posse ' it ( during the show ) . `` matsumiya also defend the hunter who bring the rifle to the set . `` when the precedent conclude that a person ' have no legitimate reason ' for bearing and carry a firearm , it assume that he or she be go to do harm or run a risk of do harm , `` he say . `` it be obvious that be not the case under these circumstance . `` ( iht / asahi : july 2,2009 ) now then , what ' s all this bull * * * * about how other industrialized nation be good off with regard to gun when compare to america ? i do not see such be the case , do you ? if you can not even touch a gun that somebody hand you to examine without break the law , that be a serious violation of human right and everything else . how can japan be so much good off than we be , if it ' s a crime for somebody to hand you a rifle to look at but not to keep ; especially when it ' s unload ?

o . k . , let go through your scenario . the government have be topple and the stand army have be crush . somehow all americas nuclear arm be obliterate . the invade force have successfully institute a dictatorship and be now systematically destroy our personal freedom . now suppose the year be 1799 and the population rise up . the five round with 200 million gun , work . the population overthroughs the invading army through sheer number , though the price be high in term of casualty . america be once again free and the democratic system be once again put in place . the year be 2004 , the population be no long fit and tough from work in the field to get their own food . but each of the 400 million people have a gun , with let say 30 round each . the population now have 12 billion round , and let assume each round be an armour piercing bullet with long range capability , and let also assume for the hell of it , that each gun be a machine gun with long - range single shot ability and a scope ( just for fun ) . same situation , same invade force . the population rise up , take along with them the few remain rocket and bomb from the few remain weapon cache . let say 2 million hand - held anti - plane missile , 4 million anti - tank missile and for even more fun , let say they have a genius military leader who have somehow the ability to maintain instant contact with any unit anywhere , and be the great tactical mind the planet have ever know . to overthrough the stand american army the invade force must have have massive number of plane , tank and naval unit . first off , 4 million anti - tank weapon be not much when put against 400 million people , so you have a lot of venerable area . where ever the militia unit try to form , they be kill by tank , even though many of the tank with infantry backing be destroy the army keep go because to over through america who have the great tank in the world , you would have to have like 10 - 1 ratio on the american armed division . but , wait . let assume somehow the ground force of well - organize troop and tank be defeat by the population . let assume the invading army again somehow lose all its ground unit , let pretend the enemy force have exactly 4 million tank , and the ratio of shot - to - kill be perfect . to defeat the american army of plane you would , again , have to have massive number ( or technology superior plane ) . so the population try shoot down the plane , but the plane would usually get away because modern plane can take out a ground - base target with out ever go closer the a couple mile . but again , wait . somehow , without lose so many troop as not to be able to defeat the massive mechanized occupying force , all plane be spot ( mile away ) and shoot down by the untrained militia . the genius military leader ( who no body though to kill ) work no doubt . yet still , the population be defeat because if i remember correctly , the militia do not have naval unit . so even if all the inland force could be kill , the majority of costal force would be protect by barrage from the enemy naval force ( which be very large because it have to defeat the american navy , the great in the world technologically ) . but let assume , the population just swim to the invade ship , kill the crew , and use the ship they steal to kill the other enemy ship . thank god for that tactical genius at the helm of the american resistance . i be actually guess that invade force must be like 20 time big then america ' s army for one simple reason . the only way you could defeat the american icbm be to have a blitzkrieg ( i know my spell suck ) like attack . most of the icbm silo be not connect to the internet , mainly because the government know the silo would be venerable to internet attack , so any rebuttal involve the virus - like disabling of the nuclear stockpile be go . now , you may be wonder what be i try to say here . well its simple , if somehow , just somehow , the entire military force of the u.s. be obliterate , it would take just one icbm hit on the enemy ' s capital city to make attack impossible . again , the blitzkrieg like attack ? even if that work the u.s. , like russia and a few other nuclear power , keep stockpile of nuclear weapon hide underground in the invent of be take over , and the underground stockpile usually have several rocket with enough range to blast the heck out of the close invading army . so it would never happen that the u.s. would be leave nuclear - naked . but let assume that happen ( maybe during a really , really cool party some idiot colonel pee on them , and they just fry ) . the genius military commander do somehow take out the entire invading force of air , ground and sea . you still have to deal with the fact that whoever invade the u.s. probably spend several trillion do it ( i know , that ' s a pretty low number for the invasion of america ) , and in that case most likely have satellite and long - range missile ( again let assume somehow america ' s own just fell out of the sky and the invading force get even guy together to be able to take out all america ' s nuclear silo include the underground stockpile which each have own guard force of soldier train night and day for such an event ) . the huge , most glaring problem with the militia , unless every one the 400 million militia unit somehow get a radio and a laptop , they would have to gather . and if they gather in the number they would need to gather in , to order to defeat the large invading army , they would be take out very easily by 1 . icbms launch from enemy sub 2 . prominent meeting between our military genius and his supporter stop by sniper with a 1.5 mile range and superb training and intelligence ( remember those satellite ) 3 . all group prepare for `` battle `` so to speak could be take out as they be march or drive or whatever by mortar , ambush , rocket , infantry rush , tank column etc . before they know what hit them . 4 . it would take a lot of plan to get 400 million people to fight , and assume everybody have a laptop with wireless capability , they would still need satellite for the military genius in california to command unit in n.y. , n.y. , and . wait america ' s satellite be go and if the invading force could do that , it would not be that hard to take out commercial internet satellite in geoscyhronize orbit ( effectively sit duck ) . and any land base network would be destroy in the first few hour of insurrection . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - but militia unit only have gun , and they would get their butt whoop , even with massive number . what you be say be only true about napoleonic tactic , in today ' s modern warfare almost completely infantry - base army be obsolete and very venerable no the afghan war be not a valid counterpoint , the terrain be different , the people be more hardened , the weapon be supply by a military power superior to the russian , the afghan have unlimited anti - tank reserve , have incredibly extensive cave network in which to hide , plan and attack , only have to defeat , on the majority , other infantry battalion because of the terrain in which armour vehicle could not cross , the russian be under fund and their moral low , the soviet have already be beat down by large amount of small fight across the crack soviet empire , china need to be supply with more troop as it start to look toward independence , afghanistan be nowhere near water eliminate the possibility of naval back - up by the very crappy russian naval force , the afghan receive help from the rest of the arab world which would not happen with the u.s. because if an enemy can take out the u.s. , it could probably take out the combined force of europe and north america , and , finally , the afgans do not have nuke so they have to defend themselves with their own two hand , but america have nuke and if ever anything tryed to do what be in the above senario they would get blast because unlike the russian in afganhistan , the american would be defend their homeland . neither be the french revolution a good - counter point , as i have say , your tactic only work with napoleonic - style battle and guess what kind of battle be happen when napoleon the 3 rd be in power ? ( in case you do not learn it in school , napoleon the 3 rd , napoleon ' s nephew , be in power during the french revolution ) trust me , cause the only thing i love more then physic be military tactic and warfare . - - - - as i have show in more detail , treat2 be right , it would not work . - - - - - - the other amendment do not pertain to retain the sovereignty of the u.s.a , they pertain to the basic right each citizen enjoy and therefore will always be important and `` in fashion `` so long as the u.s. still have human citizen . please opinion only , not baseless assumption use limited military knowledge , or rebuttal to previous opinion . so , in your opinion , be you say that this invade force that you be talk about , would never bat an eye as to whether the people of the usa be arm to the teeth or not in their pre - war planning ? surely any country that try to overtake the usa would suffer severe damage to its military in all aspect . and even if it succeed , it would still have to deal with our armed citizen . be you try to tell me that this be not a ditterent ? sure , if you dream up some darth vader size invasion , no one stand a chance . but if you put it real world perspective . say , 2 or 3 of the big country get together and decide to over take the usa . i would assume `` armed citizen `` would be a major factor in decide whether to invade or not .	0

legislative solution and popular appeal be not the same thing . the legislature be hire to do what ' s right , not what ' s popular . that aside , where have the gay right movement use voting as anything except a measure of last resort ? if gay know they could count on popular support they would not need to fight to get their right protect . we know this . we also know that ' s there ' s lot of big money oppose gay right , and sadly enough money be often the decide factor in voting . so where be vote be use as anything other than a last ditch attempt to accomplish something for the gay right movement ? well , you ignore the part where i say ' vote ' . but imo legislative solution be part and parcel to popular appeal because legislator be vote in on that basis . any legislator claim to ' do what ' s right . ' so election tend to be popularity contest . and legislator tend to want to keep their constituent happy . oh and just to make sure you understand this kronos so as not to get off in the wrong direction , this be my opinion , just like everything else i have say . it be not a lie . how be that even relevant ? i never claim it be a first resort .	0

the moral of that last story be : do not screw with baldy . that aside , where do god tell these folk to do what they do ? just curious . moral be what you make them to be . for example , ' it ' s ok to kill youth if they have insult your prophet ' be another possible one . the one in my joshua example ? he do not tell them , nor do i say that he tell them . look at what i say : ' the morality of the old testament people ( god include ) be definitely questionable . ' . however , in the next chapter he do immediately reward them , by protect them from the angry reprisal of the neighbouring village : ' 5 then they set out , and the terror of god fell upon the town all around them so that no one pursue them . ' note that in the other example , god be either command it ( through the proxy of a speaker ) or directly do it ( pillar of salt , bear etc ) .	0

the minimum drinking age should be lower to 14 if not 12 . the main problem with alcohol be drink habit , non - safe drinking habit be encourage by a high age of license due to how alcohol be more likely to be consume in bulk and away from proper supervision for those underage . law prohibit underage drinking fail to do such , and actually end up cause some of the situation they be mean to avoid . rather then alcohol be another part of life , use in moderation around family and good friend well support the economy by actualize more of the demand for it . it be give the allure of the forbidden fruit , consume as fully as possible whenever possible because its see as a rare item to behold , and often consume around shady supplier or swig from steal bottle . 14 or 12 . that be a ridiculous statement . drinking can affect the brain growth , and it go through it most radical transformation at that age . oh yeah let us all stuff up the new generation brain and crap . smart idea . if they be able to dink legally at that age it would encourage more to drink . many around that age be not able to find alcohol really . it would make the situation bad than make it good . the increase of binge drinking would also increase , it be at where it now because usually a person of that age , if they be able , can not acquire a high amount of alcohol .	0

there ' s just enough truth in that statement to keep me from say it ' s false , but if i analyze it , it will help make my point ; the word `` evolution `` have such a broad meaning that it do not have to mean atheism , but it since it be practically the only weapon that atheist have to combat the religious worldview , that ' s what it often do mean . if it should not mean it , but it be use so that it do , then that ' s what it actually mean . creationism mean religion , but it also involve a belief in the authenticity of historical document that have be meticulously preserve over thousand of year . that ' s not just religion , it ' s secular , observed history - something evolution do not have . so if a person hear your statement do not consider it carefully , it ' s very easy to be mislead by it . it imply that `` evolution `` ( the branch that declare that the book of genesis be false ) be somehow a secular , observable truth - while creationism be nothing but a religion , a superstition . since evolution can not prove the book of genesis ( ancient history ) false , and creationism do have some historical backing , they be comparable and they directly conflict . the problem be , a school teacher can make the statement you make , and it can not be legally question by anyone . yet there be a case that i read about somewhere , where a sticker be place in science textbook advise child to study evolution `` with an open mind `` , and an aclu lawsuit ensue . of all those likely to be mislead by your statement , it ' s young impressionable school child . publicly pay school teacher mislead them with statement like that , without a full explanation ( prohibit by the court ) do get an establishment of atheism start . it ' s what i mean when i say that when church and state be separate , atheism and state be combine . maybe government could be neutral , if it be small . the u.s. government be no longer small . do the christian that you know that believe in evolution , believe that there be no first man name adam , or that there be no genesis flood ? the term `` evolution `` need to be narrow down - more clearly define , for these discussion . true , but what i be try to state be that the bible have little to do with christianity if you dont believe in it . i know many christian who believe in god , and jesus etc , but think the bible be completely false , and be only a book of fable . thats what i be try to imply .	0

i be curious as to why you specifically exclude self defense as a valid reason for own a gun . data from the fbi show that victim who resist an aggressor by use of a gun be less likely to be injure than when they use other weapon for defense . i would think that this alone would validate the ownership of a gun for defensive use . on a related note , as be recently confirm by the scotus , own a firearm be an individual right . i be not aware of any other right that you be require to to demonstrate a reason prior to exercise . because self - defence , unlike most other ' reason ' , automatically allow all citizen firearm access , and in most case allow firearm ace without mandatory training / evaluation . when this occur , you be much more likely to get misuse of firearm . if you read around you will see that i consider all right as needing justification . this come both from my stance as a relativist and as a uk citizen , where there be no formalised constitution . ask yourself this - if a right can not be justify , why should it be treat as a ' right ' ?	0
yeah , that ' s generally the conclusion that i come to which be why i see nothing wrong with abortion . i be probably not go to be kill by abortion any time soon . here we go dan . your problem with the law be not whether its fair or not , its whether you can benefit personally from it . you have no problem with abortion because your not go to be the victim of such a law , but youd definitely have a problem if you be the one suffering from the law . apparently you dont care if the law disadvantage or be unfair to others , as long as it do not hurt you , you be ok with it .	0

that be not quite what the ' mitochondrial eve ' hypothesis posit . science . 1995 dec 22 ; 270 ( 5244 ) : 1930 - 6 . the myth of eve : molecular biology and human origin . ayala fj . university of california , irvine , usa . it have be propose that modern human descend from a single woman , the ' mitochondrial eve ' who live in africa 100,000 to 200,000 year ago . the human immune system drb1 gene be extremely polymorphic , with gene lineage that coalesce into an ancestor who live around 60 million year ago , a time before the divergence of the ape from the old world monkey . the theory of gene coalescence suggest that , throughout the last 60 million year , human ancestral population have an effective size of 100,000 individual or great . molecular evolution data favor the african origin of modern human , but the weight of the evidence be against a population bottleneck before their emergence . the mitochondrial eve hypothesis emanate from a confusion between gene genealogy and individual genealogy . if god transport them , we immediately have remove the flood myth from the realm of science . as if the flood itself do not do this already . ' if ' be the question . it suggest that holy tradition do not know the answer . secondly , the issue of the flood itself could still be true and test scientifically . as to whether an historical noah exist that you might consign to ' myth ' . do anyone here not find it interest that there be almost a universal factor in society concern a global flood ? p i have already discuss m - eve on another post .	0

the car crash analogy only go so far . the consequence of a car crash be merely damaged property . not all unwanted pregnancy be due to unprotected sex or irresponsibility , contraception can fail . human be sexual being , they have sex ( something some poster may understand some day if he ever have sex ) and pregnancy can occur despite the best of precaution . the puritan expect everyone to be celibate until marriage . not all people get marry . also , unwanted pregnancy also occur within marriage . i totally understand the concept of be responsible , but the consequence of a pregnancy or an unwanted child can be devastate to a woman or a couple . it be naive , simplistic and yes , punitive , to simply conclude that the woman should ' face the consequence . ' sure , no doubt . but , there be way to be absolutely 100 % sure that you do not get pregnant . the obvious way be not to have sex , but i know you will not settle for abstinance as an answer . that ' s way too religious for this site i suppose . obviously i can not propose that no one have sex unless they want child . if someone do not want to ever have child and be willing to undergo an operation ( abortion ) to remove the possibility , why can they not simply have a different operation before practice casual sex ? this be true within marriage as well .	0

ok accord to the bible god only create the first two being , adam and eve . now christians dont rule out science , and science have show that we produce offspring . god have create these offspring but not directly . think of photosynthesis , we eat meat , this be get energy from the sun indirectly . so we have show that we ourselves produce offspring but we be put here and give the abbility by god to produce offspring . as far as your question on why god alows addict to have baby it can be explain as this . we where give the freedome of choice to decide if we want to be an addict , wrong put we have the choice . god create us to have that choice , or else we would be robot . the bible also say god know everything yet to come , so he new that this particular person would become an addict and have baby . god can stop this put he doesnt interecpt dirrectly with our choice . so god already know if a particular person will become an addict ? that do not leave much free choice for that person , do it ? if i go to a restaurant and god already know i be go to choose the poached salmon for my entree , then i do not have much choice in the matter , do i ? omniscience and free will be mutually exclusive . if god be omniscient , then we be indeed ultimately robots . delude with the perception of free will , but robot none the le . unless of course , god be so omnipotent that he can know everything and still allow free choice . but then reason , logic , and think become delusional . sound like a loose / loose situation to me .	0

we be not that rich , and both of us our still finish up our college degree and be under enormous student loan burden . he support my decision to abort as neither of us would have anywhere near the time or money to support a baby ( hence our use of contraception ) , and neither of us have take a full job in our field yet to be able to provide that money to pay for the loan let alone a child . come on , people . you do not butcher an innocent baby for the conveience or sin of the parent . there ' s plenty of people in the world who would have adopt that baby . and if no one else would have , i would have .	0
no , not really . i have no idea what you be talk about . but again , how do that cause bully ? t - shirt ' s do not reach out and shove people or cause them harm . people should not bully no matter what they see on someone ' s t - shirt . be you tell me you can not figure out how create a gay - hostile atmosphere cause and condones anti - gay bullying ? forsooth ! butter would not melt in your mouth , would it .	1

not if you injure them severely because that would be mighty useless if you do not want them to crawl with their bleeding hand in agony over their mangle , broken leg so they will not be able to work no more . then the punished slave ' agony will serve as an example for all the other slave so they do not act defiantly out of line like the one you just punish . not to mention the child slave . i have explain one time too many time why it ' s a sensible thing to do in ancient time . why be the bible worth defend again ? it ' s worthy defending because you be just as much a radical as neophyte christian . i will defend the bible from you just as i will defend the scientific method from religious idiot . wow , these be some very nice value , let teach them to everyone else ! if the bible say so , why not ? you seem determine to debate about a book of flawed value . be you sure you be defend this book of it ' s value ? because surely you must have some kind of religious point of view to even think of protect a piece of old literature .	1

the reason his sentiment confirm the bad fear of creationists be not because lewontin alone have those sentiment , it ' s because creationists can clearly see those sentiment in the ny time editorial board , cnn , abc , dan rather , handgun control , the sie so everyone think that `` evolutionist `` should seize power or something ? if that be true , it be because evolution be very widely accept .	0

well yes , sarge but at the same time accipiter indicate that we be prevent accipiter and maybe others from have their opinion hear . i be just give accipiter his first amendment due . we all the time , get treat like we be the enemy , and we do not pay that any attention , because maybe to them , we be . however , it seem to me that when we treat them with the exact same treatment as they treat us , they cry foul ! be it a false claim of try to claim aggrieved status ? i think so , but i do not want to take the chance that accipiter actually feel that way . so now accipiter have an opening ! me think thou dost be too kind . yon creature willst make the false charge in any event . emoticonxkill	1
 lol , joe , kinsey be a flake and his analasis have be disproven time and agaim . david and jonathan be not lover . the bible refers to love in this case as that between brother and paul ' s ministry ? god call him to be single . nice try , but the target be 8 ' to the right . actually , if you count the kinsey 4,5 , and 6 ' s you get 18 % . it ' s 10 % for the 5 s and 6 s . that ' d be the people that prefer the same sex over opposite for the most part . 2,3 , and 4 would be those who be bi and lean slightly one way or the other . 0 and 1 be people who pretty much always choose opposite sex over same . 0 and 6 be very rare though . anyway , 10 % of people be a 5 or 6 . about 3 % be a full 6 . could jesus have be asexual ? in certain philosophy asexuality be consider a sign of enlightenment . for instance , after become enlighten , the buddha reject sexual desire .	0
so steve ; how many life have you save , thru mtm , cpr , etc . , huh ? and at least i can spell a major faith properly ; even a three letter one . glad to know you bring spell into this . show where you be in the argument . and where do the life save question come from ?	1
in this case the law and the science be in accord . the law can treat the late term fetus as a person because it have develop to the point where sentience be verifiable . let us say that the law , base upon some kind of verifiable scientific data , decide that some folk be inferior to other folk , and thus less of a person ? you know , if the law say ' because you be black , you be less of a person than shomeone who be white . you should not be upset though , all scientific data suggest that you , because you be black , be truly inferior to those who be white . ' would you think , because the law say so , that a black person be in fact a non - person ?	1
and not that i do either . hijack ? hijacking be the seizing of something by use of force . the unborn baby be force to be there . not the other way around . but you do not have 100 % personal autonomy and never will . be this really that hard to see ? well those ' slave own white guy ' ( of which not all of them have slave and most of them know slavery need to be end ) found your country and establish the government by which you feel protects your ' right to abortion ' or ' personal autonomy ' . eventhough they never establish this . every single time you make the assisinine statement ' the baby be not the woman ' s body ' you downplay the part the woman ' s body play . maybe it be not the body - but it can not live without the woman ' s body . the owner of say body should be make decision for say body . when you be willing to force pregnancy against the will and without the voice of the woman who be pregnant - you be hi - jack her body . i forget - be you one of those force the rape victim to carry the baby lifer ? pretty close and i will fight you hard if you try trample one inch of it . i still do not give a damn what they may or may have not have think about abortion , nor be that an argument i be try to make .	1
there be considerable confusion about the legal theory underlie the `` right to keep and bear arm `` . this be a brief outline for a clarification of the discussion of this issue . ( 1 ) the second amendment to the u.s. constitution do not establish the right to keep and bear arm . none of the provision of the constitution establish any `` natural `` right . they recognize such right , but the repeal of such provision would not end such right . such right be consider by many of the framer as obvious or `` self - evident `` , but they be immerse in the prevailing republican thought of the day , as express in the writing of locke , montesquieu , rousseau , madison , hamilton , and others , which discuss `` natural right `` in some detail . others argue that at least some of the right need to be make explicit in the bill of right to avoid have future generation with less understanding of republican theory weaken in their defense of those right . that have turn out to have be a good idea ( 2 ) the right to keep and bear arm be a natural right of individual under the theory of democratic government . this be clearly the understanding and intent of the framer of the u.s. constitution and be a long - establish principle of english common law at the time the constitution be adopt , which be consider to be a part of constitutional law for purpose of interpret the write constitution . so please tell me who would be the actual criminal if the government violate the supreme law of the land and make all gun illegal ? but i do thank you for prove that there be people out there who want them all , despite the bill of right say and what the supreme court prove be the correct meaning !	0
so sorry to butt in , but i would think that yes , what the woman want be all that matter since it ' s her body and her . well , this have be go over a hundred time . it would be ' nice ' to consult the man responsible but ultimately it ' s up to the woman since it ' s her body , she ' s the one stuck with the unwanted burden and blah blah . you know . whatever happen to the unborn baby ? no consult him or her i guess . even though the unborns body be be be the one be torn apart .	1
on what ground do you seek to redefine the institution of marriage from it ' s accept standard in this country ? how about get the government out of marriage entirely ? that be the goal of the libertarian , and maybe the liberal . no standard would be redefine if that happen , and gay would get their right to marry .	0
incidentally , be the title of this forum meant to imply that creationism and intelligent design be two name for the same thing ? while i agree that they be more similar to each other than to evolution , it trouble me that anyone would believe that they be synonymous . for those that think the title be justified , what about the two belief do you find similar enough to class them as the same idea ? because of the history of it . well , id be actually identical to ' scientific creationism ' , but spruce up with more scientific terminology to attempt to pass ' seperation of church and state ' . let us just say that i.d . be an attempt to teach creationism in school .	0
no doubt that people who be determine to be anti - bush will always try and find something wrong with it , but i think bush ' s speech last night be very good . he be confident , poise , the speech have substance and specific , and he show once again that he ' s a good orator than he ' s give credit for . even a number of democrat complemeted it . only the hard people would not be touch by the iraqi woman who ' s husband be kill by saddam ' s intel , embrace the mother of a fall soldier . a lot of people get teary at that unstaged moment , include the president himself . kind of put the whole thing in perspective . be that why when everyone turn their back to bush to cheer the couple , bush just sit there with his hand fold look impatient ? what be really sicken to me be when everyone put ink on their finger . they totally cheapen the bravery of the iraqi . none of these pissants wait in line where they might be shoot . they do not walk home hop no one would see the ink and kill them . and they certainly be not in the middle of the war . it be truly sick for them to have that ink on their finger .	0
do you think mr . bledsoe would have wind up dead if the perps have be carry baseball bat and he have say , youre not go to hit me with that thing ? nothing less than a gun will work when you guy want to defend yourselves , but all weapon be equally deadly in the hand of another . you do not see a contradiction there ? i do not see why not . if somebody be perfectly willing to murder you in cold blood despite your blind compliance i see no reason to believe that they ' d hesitate if it mean crush a skull with a bat rather than just shoot them in the face . seriously , what kind of stability be you deal with when all it take to motivate someone to murder be a simple question ? a baseball bat be not concealable like a handgun , be it ? nor can it be readily use by someone suffer arthritis or use in a cramped location . any weapon can be use to inflict death and murder . the human body be hardly a modern marvel of resiliency and near - indestructibility . even sneeze wrong can be potentially fatal . certainly not . do you see a contradiction ?	1

the fact be foundit , that creationists and i - ders understand that there be so many unanswerable question , so we know we can not answer them for certain , because man just do not have the knowledge to discern the truth from the minutia . so we should just say `` god do it `` , and give up ?	0
that ' s really simplify . it ' s not like a woman ' s body be a suitcase and the fetus be biologically self - reliant . it live off her life process - her blood , her immune system , her calorie - it put stress on her joint , muscle , heart , and bladder . pregnacy can demand major sacrifice in behavior and diet - some of which can be detrimental . no a baby be not the woman ' s body - but a pregnancy be . ha wouldnt you say someone who be really overweight actually have more of a problem with stress on their joint , muscels , heart , and bladder than a woman carry a small child in her womb ? obesity can demand major scarifices in behavior and diet . some of which can be detrimental . i really dont see your point because this isnt just a woman ' s problem when it come to these issue you point out . and im not really sure what a `` pregnancy `` be accord to you . please explain . when i hear the word pregnant , i think of 2 people , not just 1 . also , the baby have its own blood , its own immune system , and contain its own calorie once consume . there nothing that the mother have that the baby doesnt other than it just need nutrtion . just like you need food everyday .	0
i have be tell this board for month that the gene be not the player in biological change that everyone think it be . actually , it be . there be multitude of known characteristic that have be show to be the result of a single point difference in the gene . the discovery of regulatory function of some translated segment of dna do not in any way discount what be know about gene function .	0
and what of when you go by some moral standard to determine what be right and wrong in other people ' life as well ? what ? you do not do that ? bull . you can not tell me you never have an opinion or judgment on anything anyone else do . but by your logic , that would be impose on them . sorry , that dog just do not hunt . everyone have some basis for the view they have about they way they think society would be best . there ' s no law that say people can not participate in that process with religion or anything else as their moral basis . ' impose religion ' be not the same as use religion as a basis , and it ' s the fact that you be wrong on this that ' s why religious people be continually able to have religion as their basis of social change , just as equally as anything else . of course everyone have some basis for their view . not even deny that . however there be way that use that `` basis `` most certainly be an imposition and the gay right battle be a prime example . there be many , many , many people who have do work to stop / block gay marriage and other gay right when they , themselves , be not gay . that be not merely pass judgement - that be imposition . all i be ask here be that archie , you , jp , etc . own that .	0

it ' s nice to think that you will ' plan ' a child later but , life seldom work that way . i ' d hate to think that once you be finally ready to have a child , your uterus have be scar to infertility or have sever complication in conception , carry the child to term or delivery . i ' d be ironic for another yuppy type who can not have child on their own due to an abortion to have to incure great medical cost to have one or legal cost to adopt . and maybe even seek a foreign child as there be not any easily to be have here . since they be all abort . also , the old you get , the more health issue possible for the child . i will have you know that the abortion go without a hitch , and my uterus be perfectly healthy , thankyouverymuch ( not that it be any of your emoticonxcensored business ) , and yes , i do plan to have a child in the future , and do not really care what you think about it .	0
i do not see it that way at all . moore handle himself way well than i expect before i hit the play button . i think for sure that he would be `` outfoxed `` to use a pun . then you must have expect him to be a mute on the show . he be basically just there ; he make no worthy comment . it be so bad he have to resort to an emotional hypothetical . he make no sense , and that comment have no part in the interview . bush do not send kid to iraq . first of all they volunteer . second of all , they be old than 18 . please let me know what comment michael moore make that you think be worthy . you might have trouble .	1
wrong - a 1 month old have human organ , a fertilized egg of say 3 week have no human organ . that ' s the difference . this be a fact and the question be not whether the human organ be fully develop or not but the fact that there be no human organ at all in a fertilized egg of say 3 week . do you have to have human organ to be consider a person ? who make this rule ? you ? what if you get lung remove . be you less of a person ? so around 8 week though you believe it be in fact a human ?	1
this apply only when men strive . that be fight . if a man `` accidently `` hit a woman while in a fight and cause her to lose her child then all he have to do be pay a fine . but if he keep fight and hurt other people he get kill . even in the bible you dont get punish so severly on accident . this make more sense then anything else i have hear on this thread .	0
to refute your example of contemorary ' christian ' deciding that violence be a good thing . see , you grasp at what you like without resort to your own bible to support your fleshly desire . just like arch do . i counter that and use the scripture ( which be good for the education in all thing ) to show what these ' believer ' should have do . now , if you want to actually study your bible and use contradictorary verse to support your stance , feel free . that ' d just support the concept that the bible be self - contradicting . you resort to the bible , just in whatever way be convenient to what you want it to say . just like fundies do . zardoz , the problem be that when you play devil ' s advocate ( which you like to do ) , you only take a fundie approach toward the scripture . in fact , you be often more fundamentalist in the way you approach scripture than fundamentalist . you ' d make a good fundie , the best of them , i suppose .	1
you could go there but it will not change the fact i do not agree with your idea of what be say . you believe it be say one thing and i believe it say something else . we have an entire supreme court to do the same sort of interpretation game with our constitution . they sit and make decision and interpreations base on what they think it say . the bible be the same game . not to me , but let us not quibble about thing we can not change . let us talk about something that we can change . for a change . we could argue about it forever and never change one thing that ' s write . how about make a proposal suit to fit those whose religious belief tend to make us feel inferior ? or pass legislation that more medical staff be train in ' special ' field of medicine for certain disease so that constant referral will not bounce us off the wall .	1
perhaps when the roman catholic church have cleanse itself of its own sin it could have a dialogue with woman about abortion - - which be not a sin . that ' s be ridiculously poor logic . simply becuase the church make mistake do not mean it ' s incorrect in all other charge . the us government be way more corrupt than the catholic church , and yet we obey every god - damned thing big brother make us do .	0

so . eh ? hows this sound ? will it fly with conservative and progressive ? i think so . - mosheh thezion emoticonxhoho there ' s a fair few problem with this . off the top of my head . what happen when the pregnancy be accidental , and neither the mother nor the father want a child ? what consequences would there be for a mother who do not want to give the name of the father ? would there be any ? why be only the father punish ? have consensual sex be just that - consensual on the part of both people . if it be not consensual , rape law already cover it and if it be consensual and a pregnancy occur , why punish only one of the consenting individual ? on a more fundamental level : what evidence do you have that have an abortion be ' a mortal sin ' ? why should the court be concern with prevent a religious concept ?	0

why do not you try to make george walker bush feel a little guilt and trauma for destroy the nation of iraq , for murder ten of thousand of innocent woman and child , for cause the death of nearly 3,000 young american who leave behind mourn mother , father , wife , husband , in some case many child who will be leave to the mercy of our nation ' s horrible economy and will probably live in poverty for the rest of their life . probably because this be an abortion forum and not a forum about the iraq war . not only that , there be no parallel .	1

you have two completely different thing in your question so , i will just split them up . social program ( arm redistibution of wealth ) . i only agree with those allow by the u.s. constitution or by the respetive state constitution . i can not find a provision in the u.s. constitution which allow funding for social program . have not read all the state constitution so , i withhold comment on state . speak like a true conservative , not one of those liberal `` compassionate conservative `` . emoticonxgood	1
and yet , even though creationists ask for detailed list of every creature in transition over a period of several million year , i have never find a single creationist who can trace his ancestor back to adam , a period of only about 6,000 year . the best i can do be to trace my ancestor back to the 1 6 0 0 s . my mom can only trace her family back a few generation . by the time we get to the clan that live in ohio in the middle of the 1 9 th century , the record get very confusing and very incomplete . by creationist logic , we must then accept that my ancestor , white american , be specially create in north america by god .	0

i find it funny how a person can see how wrong it be to kill a baby after cut it from a womb , yet they do not think it ' s wrong while the baby be still in it . that ' s what baffle me about pro - choicers ( pro - abortionist ) . i wonder if there be a glass window allow people to see what they be kill , if they would still feel no emotion . why do you think they feel no emotion ? all the woman i know who have abort do so under very difficult circumstance and it be horrible for them . most woman who seek abortion be not unfeeling slut . they be real woman , with real issue , and real circumstance that lead them to that choice . want to help those baby ? address the issue the woman face and do not demonize . no amount of legislation can make for succesful pregnancy without the support of the mother . dismiss her and you will fail to do anything to help anyone .	0
well , i guess the point be . if one be right , you have to have a basis for determine which to follow instead of go at a whim . if you choose to honor some stuff of the bible and not some other stuff in it than you pretty much rule out that religion , have you not ? if you have not than what basis to you have for change the rule ? the preists surely be not ' god in disguise ' now be they ? i assume you be christian ? do you follow everything in the bible ? i guess you good get stoning of your neighbor go then for work on sunday and wear blend fabric . oh yes i do take offense that you want to kill gay people since you believe that you can not ignor some part of the bible . you be then comanded to kill gay people , prostitute , and smartmouthed child .	1
not really . eugenics be not follow evolution . hitler for example do not follow evolution at all . his entire aryan race do not have a single fact of evolution in it . so you evolve and the aryan race be create by god ? i have never hear that before .	1
i agree . time will tell if the cell be as effective as embryonic stem cell , and it seem on the surface , they well might be . except . these stem must be donate by pregnant woman . amniocentesis , while pretty darn safe , be not without risk . first , the pregnant mother must donate the cell . the risk to the fetus be not zero . when we already have a zero risk procedure from cell that be go to be dispose of anyway . in any event , i be sure some nut job with an extremely skewed sense of morality will find a way to call this procedure immoral in some way . yeah , it do have risk unlike the embryonic stem cell , but i think that if it come out the way they hope , it will eventually lead to more embryonic us as well when people realize that this can have risk . i think it be good to have this way as a back up while people argue over the use of cell that would otherwise be dispose , and get some treatment to people who need it rather than let it be deny to them by anti - abortionist . and yeah , it ' s pretty much guaranteed that someone will find something to object about , claim it be immoral ( maybe it will now be that these stem cell be potential human life and we can not use them emoticonxrolleyes ) , but it will likely not have as many objection .	0

within the community of christian believer there be area of dispute and disagreement , include the proper way to interpret holy scripture . while virtually all christian take the bible seriously and hold it to be authoritative in matter of faith and practice , the overwhelming majority do not read the bible literally , as they would a science textbook . many of the beloved story find in the bible – the creation , adam and eve , noah and the ark – convey timeless truth about god , human being , and the proper relationship between creator and creation express in the only form capable of transmit these truth from generation to generation . religious truth be of a different order from scientific truth . its purpose be not to convey scientific information but to transform heart . we the undersigned , christian clergy from many different tradition , believe that the timeless truth of the bible and the discovery of modern science may comfortably coexist . we believe that the theory of evolution be a foundational scientific truth , one that have stand up to rigorous scrutiny and upon which much of human knowledge and achievement rest . to reject this truth or to treat it as “ one theory among others ” be to deliberately embrace scientific ignorance and transmit such ignorance to our child . we believe that among god ' s good gift be human mind capable of critical thought and that the failure to fully employ this gift be a rejection of the will of our creator . to argue that god ' s love plan of salvation for humanity preclude the full employment of the god - give faculty of reason be to attempt to limit god , an act of hubris . we urge school board member to preserve the integrity of the science curriculum by affirm the teaching of the theory of evolution as a core component of human knowledge . we ask that science remain science and that religion remain religion , two very different , but complementary , form of truth . over 10,000 signature of christian clergy have be collect , and have endorse this letter .	0

why be there so many people that express interest in who i love ? ( a rhetorical question ) why be there so many people that express interest in how i love ? ( also a rhetorical question ) with all of the atrocity in this country and the world , it seem so odd that politician and those of ' religion , ' as well as the public in general , be so interested in our personal life . why can not the politician and those of ' religion ' and the public in general place their interest in the atrocity ? and to negate an expected reply , who i love and how i love be not an atrocity in any way . see there be such a thing as heterosexual privledge . some heterosexual will do anything , or say anything to protect this privledge . for the christianist it be all about control , and money . the christianist will say anything or do anything to maintian their money and control . take own own archangel , for example , in everyone of his post he extol his religious belief and his belief that everyone should be both hetero and his brand of christian . one must ask themselves ; why do he peach against something that do not personally effect his life ? i have come to the conclusion that he be afraid that he will loose his heterosexual privledge and his control as a christian .	0

' impose religion ' be not the same as use religion as a basis , and it ' s the fact that you be wrong on this that ' s why religious people be continually able to have religion as their basis of social change , just as equally as anything else . except several rligious organization around the country have finance , and gather signature to put anti gay marriage amendment on the ballot . they have a religious belief that marriage be between one man and one woman . they have turn this belief into law regaurdless of the religious belief of gay people . any one who have vote yes to place these amendment into state constitution because they have a religious belief that exclude gay people from marriage have also impose those religious belief upon gay people . in short i have be bar from marry the person i love because someone else , that i do not know and who do not know me , have some sick religious belief .	0

recent study apparently show that pot be more harmful than you say . one joint be say to contain more carcinogen than four tobacco cigarette . i doubt your 20,000 joint theory . you have a simplistic argument go for pot . i can not agree that legalize all drug would be a good thing either . program in holland have fail to produce significant if any benefit to society in general . the druggies seem to have benefit by have arrest - free drug zone and access to whatever they want , but the cost of drug still require some income , something that most of them likely do not have other than from crime , beg or social program . one `` benefit `` i see from legalize drug be that the user could be more easily identify . yea the legalizatioin of drug would cause an epedimic of problem . crime , suicide , mental health problem , and physical health problem .	0
you do not think we could find denizen of stormfront who would claim that they do not hate black people but they think it be sinful for white and black people to have relationship , and then point to , say , the anti - defamation league and accuse them of hatred ? please clarify what you be say here as it make no sense to me . what point be you try to make ? off the top though , any comparison you make with be black and homosexuality be false because the bible do not condemn be black but it do condemn the homosexual act / lifestyle . and who do the anti - defamation league promote hat ? i be unaware of it if they do it .	0

i do not think so . i think everyone else be overcomplicating it . yeah , gay can not reproduce . survival to the fit would indicate that gay should die off , but they be be help along . if they be not help along and be tell to rely solely on themselves then they would have no chance of survival . well if that ' s the way human work then the gay island would not do any good , unless of course you be say gay be not human . but i be guess what you mean be if the gay die off and the straight island have it ' s resource destroy then the island itself would be bad off , but i be talk more about the people ' s civilization , not the island itself . sorry about lesbian island . it get hit by 2 earthquake and a tsunami and sunk into the ocean . let us see if i understand you correctly , because i think you may be on to something incredibly insightful . let us see , the island with male and female , uh , can reproduce , and , . uh , eureka , i have get it ! you need a male and female to sexually reproduce ! that ' s ingenious ! you be brilliant , cool spot ! you be forget one thing . the island without the gay guy would not be nearly as fabulous .	1

both atheist and agnostic will tell you they see no evidence for the existence of any god . some will continue with `` thus , there be not one `` and other will continue with `` as for the other , i do not know `` . the agnostic position be obviously tentative , however even though the atheist do not explicitly state his position be tentative , you will be hard press to find an atheist who state `` there be absolutely , positively , with out a doubt , no god at all `` . that distinction may be irrelevant since they do say that no god that any religious person believe in exists . and that be what i be get at originaly . still i think that the idea that the existence of all religious god can be ultimately refute base on the logic you bring up be invalid .	0
do you think that english be in some way uniquely suit to the pursuit of science ? there be a pretty long history of science in india . i be not an expert on pre - colonial india but i be pretty certain it be not the primitive land you seem to think it be . western science could have be obtain by other source than colonisation . japan be an alternative example of how trade with the west might have occur . you choose to distort my post by your suggestion about a ' primitive land ' : i neither say nor intend to imply as much . try not to let your tendency towards political correctness seek hidden meaning in what be attempt a give a balanced account of historical event . british imperialism happen : it be not a completely baleful phenomenon . it have some beneficial outcome even if they be not intend . english happen to be the lingua franca of science , economics , etc . i do not know whether it ' s uniquely suit to it . do you ? it ' s obvious that other language have an input : i be not make a judgement about them .	0

hey easy , ive get a question for you , which i think you probably have answer a million time before . what right do you have to dictate how people spend their life ? in america it ' s call free speech . if anyone here there , or elsewhere in america do not like free speech , and do not like a debate forum where the word of god be find , then they can go whine to their mother ( yo mama ) .	1
the solution be for people like you to look past their own `` morality `` and past their own nose ! which you would do by have teacher teach kid that be gay be alright . you would teach those kid , against their parent wish , that be gay be alright . you would do that after you make it legal without a popular vote . seem that you really do not give a rat ' s x about this poor dead kid at all . you just see his corpse and throw him on top of your gay marriage banner . how noble of you .	1
the process to fossilize a bone be painfully slow . non - fossilize tissue can not survive more than a few year , let alone long enough for any other part of the bone to become fossilzed ! it would decompose ! actually , the process of fossilisation be not slow and can be do relatively quickly . all what you need be for sediment to quickly cover a dead ( or an alive body - as what would have happen to noah ' s flood ) and hence , fossilsation can occur rapidly ; evolutionarly speaking , fossil take million of year to fossilise a bone , but unless the bone be cover by sediment quickly , the bone will never fossilise .	0

thats an easy one . the obvious and correct answer be a resounding no . it have have no effect on the criminal use of gun and no think person would have predict that it would . it would be like reduce the number of scalple salesman in an effort to reduce botched surgery . but would not it make it more likely that a gun dealer that be involve in gun trafficking would be audit and catch by the atf ? if there be less ffls then the atf have more time to monitor and inspect each gun dealer .	0
in reality , there be no concrete ' reason ' for believe in god . if you believe in god , you believe base on faith . there be no incontrovertible physical evidence anywhere to even suggest that god exists . unless you first believe through faith that god exist . this statement be wrong . people from hundred of year before jesus be bear prophesy that a baby would be bear , in bethlehem , of a virgin . there be over 50 more prophesies that be make about his life , and the sacrafice he make to pay for the sin of man , and the big one of all . he completely fufilled scripture when he rise from the dead . these men be inspire by jesus , god , how can you argue that he be not the christ ? the odds of one man fill all the prophesies be impossible . and these scripture have be unchanged for the past 2000 - 2500 approx year ! thats proof for me that jesus exist and that he be god . pm me if you like .	0

if the flood never happen ( an assumption ) , then it be much more likely that the dating method would be accurate to age of ten of thousand of year as many evolutionary scientist state . evolutionary scientist be a confusing term . a geochronologist might work out an age for a lava sample for example . astronomer have also make comment on the age of the earth as have paleontologist study certain fossil . so why would no flood make radiometric much more likely to accurate as you say ? can we hear some specific detail on this as it be kinda significant to back you your assumption .	0

by the way , my personal opinion be that real scientist be try to be objecticve and actually explore something before completely trash it . and creationism be investigate and explore completely and show to be false .	1
false . this be not a valid definition of atheism . atheism be the lack of theism ( the belief in god ) . certainly , if i say `` there be not a tiger in my bathroom `` , i would not need to have a camera in there to see . it ' s call be reasonable . how do you know there be not a tiger in the bathroom ? you feel very strongly and have over - whelm evidence that there be no tiger in your bathroom ? ( you live in an urban area , there be no zoo , you do not hear scratch or bite or the maiming of your poodle , and the water be go ) but you can not prove a negative . which be also why you will not be able to prove that creationism be wrong , and why we can not prove evolution be wrong . the focus must be on prove one right . how you might do that depend on your method of reason and thought .	0

easily understood when man create his own god . indeed true . god create man in his own likeness and man return the favor . man create a vindictive , vengeful , and vicious god , accord to the bible . so where do a loving god come from ?	1
without question my large beef with god would have to be the fact that accord to the bible you need to believe in god in some fashion or another in order to make it into heaven . the reason this be my beef with him be because it be much more difficult to believe in him when you be bear in india than if you be bear in the us or europe . the indian culture be that of hinduism and a mix of other religion unlike that of the us and europe which be primarily christian . that mean be bear in the us or europe give you a good chance of make it to heaven as you be more likely to end up be a christian and believing in god . would the be at all fair if this be the case ? my answer be plainly and simply no ! it be idiotic infact . if god exist and he be perfect then almost without a doubt he would have to base get into heaven on the action of a person instead of the belief of a person to be fair . his system would not be at all perfect if be bear in one place mean you get into heaven while be bear in another place mean you do not get into heaven . furthermore this mean that he need to take into consideration other influence on your life include whether or not your parent or community be proper place to grow up and whether or not you be ever give the proper situation in which to change your life to god ' s expectation . if not give any opportunity or give very few and still turn out to be a decent person should be good than if you turn out to be a decent person and be give many opportunity to end up this way . god in all his perfection would need a very complicated system to judge who get into heaven in order for it to be fair but i just do not see spell out in the bible . why would anyone want to get to heaven ? archangel and people like him would be there , pray and chant 24 / 7 . thanks but no thanks !	1
i live in utah and every public school have a building on the ground call the seminary . actually , the mormon seminary be not `` on the ground , `` although they may be on an adjacent , privately own piece of property . it would be unconstitutional for the seminary to be on property own by the school district . the child go to the seminary on release - time , which have be find to be constitutional ( although i do not see how ) . pertinent decision about religious instruction and school be : mccollum v . board of education ( 333 u.s. 203 ) zorach v . clauson ( 343 u.s. 306 ) mccollum find that religious instruction on school property be unconstitutional , while zorach find that `` accommodate `` religious instruction by release student from school for that purpose be not .	0
still , some scientist worry that the use of war metaphor have negative effect on both science and the scientist who adopt the language . which of course say volume . on the other hand such metaphor be appropriate in many case . for example consider the vaccination program for smallpox which eradicate the disease fapp . it be indeed a struggle and new tool and technique be critical to reach the objective . from jenner to the end of the virus as a human pathogen .	0
first off the single common ancestor model have no demonstratable mechanism for how it be even possible . for another thing no substantive reason that all scientist use be empirically testable which be why subjective / objective duality be the philosophy of natural science . there be only a need to discern between the substantive reasoning ( theoretical ) and empirical testing ( demonstrative ) . objectivism be base on substantive reasoning just like scientific positivism or natural selection for that matter . none of these thing be subject to peer review since there be a distinction between subjective and objective reasoning . * * * * * * * * . utter fraking * * * * . scientist have already accumulate mound of evidence which suggest the common ancestor . you choose to ignore it as do most scientifically ignorant christian .	0

you ' d have to show me their announcement of bias and conspiratorial intent , before i ' d agree that they be as bad as you imply , but i have no question that they admit the possibility of extrapolation of id for religious purpose far more than atheist admit the possibility of extrapolation of evolution for atheistic purpose . why ? because christian have guideline about lie . i feel a no true scotsman come on . should i even bother to mention hovind ?	1
let me get this straight . we can not force a woman to give birth if she do not want the child , but we can force the father to pay for the child ' s care regardless of whether he want the child or not ? interest . yes because it be `` officially `` a life . whether a person believe in life at conception or not they all agree it be life at birth and half way through life it be still life and right before death it be still life . if she do not want the child she can refrain from sex , use a contraceptive or abortion . if he do not want it he can refrain from sex ( not likely for men ) , use a condom ( not a guarantee to work ) , have surgery ( hard to reverse ) but that be it . so if he be to use a condom and get her pregnant she still have the last option .	0
lmao ! do you read my last sentence , the conclusion of my post ? and i quote : `` so to answer your question : yes `` damn im so evasive ! since you ask the question again , ill answer again stuff about us be in a democratic system as a christian , if a legal matter be be contest , and you want to oppose it , you be certainly welcome to do so . as a gay , if you want to propose a legal matter , a christian should be equally welcome to contest it . it be do unto others as they would have others do unto them , so to answer your question : yes be that so hard ? anti gay christian do want gay to oppose their , marriage , discriminate against them , oppose christian from be able to adopt , and practice thier religion . since anti gay christian be do all these thing to gay people then that be how they want gay people to treat christian .	1

governmental funding be not available ( to my knowledge ) without some ( if not total ) government control of the program . if there ' s any sure way to install inefficiency in a program , it be to let the government run it . i favor privatization , allow those who want the program to fund and control it , those who do not to decline . donation would be tax deductible . even with tax deductible status , i seriously doubt there ' s enough of a market available yet to make privatization a go concern . since all people will ostensibly benefit from whatever flow from the space program , it seem like government be still the only option now . sure , the russian be capitalize on their experience by take citizen for ride , but what be they really learn or advance there ? they be get more and more vocal about us fund their stupid space station . the european be primarily interested in the lucrative satellite - launching business ; again , where ' s the hard science ? so it seem to fall to the american - - surprise . but if we do not do it , the chinese certainly will . in all probability , they will be fierce competitor , imo .	0
true , but as lurch correct me before : it be the theory of evolution . and i be go to correct you again . the theory of evolution be by no mean an extreme view . it be the prevailing view . more than 99 % of biologist accept the theory of evolution as the best explanation for the observation .	0
i be only rabidly against something so obviously untrue as that of mainstream religion . my argument be that the only reason it be mainstream be that we continually perpetuate it by indoctrinate our kid with it . do you honestly believe you would have find whatever religion you prescribe to if you have not be persuade to from an early age ? why do not you pick islam ? the only difference in christianity and islam in my mind be that islam happen to be the religion of poor state that have be oppress by empire state . if christianity be the religion in the middle east and northern africa and the west be islamic , you would probably see suicide bomb christian . i expect i will likely get another roflmao out of you for say this , but it be probably true . the only difference between islam and christianity be demographic . reckon you do not know much about christianity then . when you can bust the resurrection of jesus christ then you might have something to argue about . until then your claim that christianity be untrue be simply a lot of hot air .	0
as i be sure you know , the declaration of independence state : `` . all men be create equal , they be endow by their creator with certain unalienable right , that among these be life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . `` who or what do you consider to be the ( capitalise ) creator in this text ? more importantly , who do you think the author of the declaration consider the creator to be ? the declaration certainly seem to tie up the notion of ' inalienable right ' with religion . no more , i be go to bed . in my reading of the declaration ( and use the 1 st . amendment as a filter ) it do not matter who or what the founder mean by `` creator . `` the conlusion be the same ; regardless . namely ; the fact that the founder consider our basic right to be inherrent .	0

why do people on the pro - gun side continuously try to oversimplify the issue ? no one be really argue that there would be zero murder without gun . the question be would there be less murder without gun . in developed nation with stricter gun law there be less murder . at any rate , i do not think you can draw such conclusion base on one incident . a slimey claim you can not support as usual . in developed nation , the u.s. be far down the list as have be post on this very board at least 5 time . those ' other ' nation also have far more crime and violent crime than the u.s .	0

i go about this wrong . i be mean that it would take million of year for wing to evolve . during these million of year , they will be undeveloped , simply mass attach to the dinosaur , and totally useless . when they reach their fully evolve form , they may have be of use , but until then , they could serve no purpose , and help the dino in no way at all , serve only as excess weight , and large profile , hinder survival by not allow particularly good hiding or movement . during the actual period of the wing evolution , they would be totally useless . and yet this be what they fossil record show . there be alot of information float around on the us of feather for insulation , hunt technique , display etc before flight . half a feather might not be as good for flight as a `` fully develop `` one , but dinosaur have them and they probably be able to glide , albeit poorly , with them . even less of a feather might shade a pool of water to allow them to spot small fish or for display to attract a potential mate . to say they be `` totally useless `` , be simply false . evolution work on adapt already functional structure for different function .	0

why be i not surprise at such an answer . people with no common sense nor the ability or desire to recognize the obvious need someone else to tell them what to think . you people can remain in denial of reality but we have hundred of thousand of bar and club , both straight and gay throughout this country , and they be all pack to overflow 5 out of 7 night a week , every week of the year . if you actually think that the vast majority be there just for a drink with friend then you explain why we have million of abortion each year by mostly single unattached woman ? where be they all get pregnant genius , in church , at work and in school ? emoticonxgood why be i not surprise at your lack of a response to my point ? why be i not surprised that you be supply no evidence ? and there be million of bedroom with people gettin ' busy inside , too . can we rail against those as well ? in bed , with their partner . you be marry and you still do not know where this generally happen ?	1

if you have notice , i never point out the flaw in evolution to `` make creationism true . `` but that be your goal whether you want to admit it or not . and that be your sole way of defend creationism as you have admit you can not argue creationism base on its own merit . creationism be wrong independent of evolution . even if you somehow manage to disprove evolution ( along with every science ) you still have to even take a single step towards prove creationism .	0

it ' s technically not kill . kill mean make it dead . for the most animal , the indicator for life be brain activity ( note : brain activity be one of the requirement of life , but it ' s not the definition ) . when the sperm meet the egg , there be no brain activity . in fact there maybe no brain activity until the end of the first trimester . actually , at 24 week be when the the interconnection of the fetal brain begin . the nerve cell from the neocortex begin to synapse with the nerve cell of the thalamus . it be at this point that burst of recognizable brain wave start to appear among the random signal that go on before . it be at this point that some scientist believe a fetus can feel pain as well . it be also at this point that a fetus can possibly survive outside of the womb ( 23 - 24 week ) , though the cance of survival be low and the risk of impairment very serious . this point probably will not change with technology either because the fetal lung be not mature enough until this point for even mechanical - assist breathing .	0

you claim that the distinction between a baby be a bodily function of a woman or not be a matter of “ empirical fact ” , this be just not so . i think you should rethink what “ empirical fact ” be . empirical fact , be fact that be say to be true on the basis of empirical observation . if i see a light on in a room , that be an empirical observation , and for me , that the light be on , be an empirical fact . however , if you and i both empirically observe at a fetus in a womb then the only empirical fact we could both agree on , i think , be that there be indeed a fetus in a womb . i say that fetus be part of a person body perform a function , you say its something else , and that ' s a mater if ideology , not mere observation . so for example if i say `` you be a part of my body , and therefore i have a right to kill you `` , be this simply a matter of ideology ? i admit the distinction be not clearcut at early stage of development , but how do you support the idea that post - birth child be `` a part `` of their mother ' body and therefore legitimate to kill ? it be no more legitimate to say that a fetus be a part of a woman ' s body than it be to say that a woman be a part of a fetus ' body . just as a woman be not a subordinate slave to the fetus within her , the fetus can not be consider subordinate in right to the woman it be inside .	0

this doesnt really add up to anything more than your musing so i will take up one point . respect for your mother and father be only relevant in a society where the nuclear family be the norm . there have be some society where this be not the norm . im afraid to say this demonstrate another example of someone that believe the world be and always be as he live it . respect ( or fear ) be necessary for a functioning society but not necessarily towards parent . which be exactly what the commandment order . sorry your mightiness , thank you for your graciousness of address us common folk . be you really that obtuse ? i swear you and easy share a brain . i clearly point out that this commandment talk about respect for authority . personally , i think this applies to single parent , family with 2 daddy , or child raise in an orphanage . yet i bet somehow in the formative year of the child , they be taught some form of respect for authority . how so ? i do not write it , i be just comment on it . and again , i prefer to replace ' mother and father ' with authority . regardless , who say respect = fear ? maybe you and easy really do share a brain . you both seem to think you can define word as you see fit to lend creedence to your argument .	1

there be nothing about the theory of evolution that preclude a god . that fabricate idea be absurd . there be nothing about the theory of relativity , nor the theory of gravity , nor the theory that the earth be round that preclude the existence of a creator god . in reality , god may or may not exist . some people believe god exists . others do not believe god exist . neither view can be prove base on physical evidence . both be beliefs only . though one of those belief must necessarily be true . i do not say that evolution precludes god , all i be say be that many atheist seem to think it do , and thus it likely contribute to the number of people who beleive there be no god . if a person do not beleive in god , then they must beleive there be no ultimate morality .	0
there be a teleology in the universe , but it ' s far more subtle and pervasive than you seem to think it be . could you perhaps define `` teleology `` as you understand it and say why you believe there be teleology in the universe ?	0
all the knowledge from science have come from trust mutual experience . it have get us far and will continue to ( as long as we do not destroy ourselves in misuse that knowledge ) . but the belief that ' its gotten us far ' be itself a ' scientific ' type belief , in fact it have less proof on the empirical assumption than the science itself . justify the validity of experience by experience be the intellectual equivalent of say ' god must exist , because god be good and would not allow a world without god ' .	0
where in the hell do all the anti - gunner on this board go ? do they all run off or give up the fight ? could it be that they have finally realize that there be no viable argument for gun control in a country that be build on freedom to bear arm ? each time the control - lobby come up with an argument . they get shot to piece . ( laugh out loud ! ) it be interest to note that both of the democratic front - runner for 2008 favor gun control . with the recent death of charlton heston , there ' s a weakness in the armor of the nra . i would go on a handgun buying spree , but i already have enough gun and ammo to stave off a thousand or so government guntakers at a place we call ' the little alamo ' .	1

you can have all sort of discussion about pain etc . you can come up with useful way of help people cope . however when you fully understand and aspect of pain in term of nerve impulse and how your fancy painkiller stop them that be a good result . so restrict yourself to what you can measure can have result and should not be dismiss as `` bad because all restriction be bad `` . then should not your challenge be re - word to say `` what might be the best . `` because at present we be not at a stage where by we know everything about ' pain ' therefore in the current climate , rather than what might be know down the track , i think i have meet the majority of your challenge . after - all , you be insist now on what ' you can measure ' , and we can not measure all that there be about pain , at present .	0

so what . congress can pass any law it want . do not mean it will stand up in court . the first portion , `` a well regulate militia , be necessary to the security of a free state , `` be a qualifier to what follow `` the right of the people to keep and bear arm , shall not be infringe . `` it seem pretty clear to me . but i be not one of the justice . this decision have be make , although i do not like it or agree with it . i do not see where today ' s hobbyist meet the intent - most especially in the well - regulate part . but there come a point where what the dead guy think just do not matter that much . it be 200 + year later . they leave us with the ability to adjust with time and we have do that . they recognize their own shortcoming which might have the the wise thing they do . the current interpretation be clear . we look at the last portion of the statement only . i do not think that , as i say before , a little common sense , be go to alter the interpretation in any meaningful way . after all , i could easily argue ( if i be totally stupid ) that my front yard be the perfect place for a working cannon . we both know that be not go to fly . just where do the armament argument end . with a cannon ? or with a nuc . let us face it . they say arm and they mean arm . not gun . they ' d probably let me have the cannon . the found father never envision the kind of weapon we ' d have available today or what they ' d be use for . that ' s why their thought be purposely criptic and open end . since we will always draw the line someplace , why not draw it at a good compromise between you and me . you ask where the line should be draw in regard to weapon ? how about where ownership and use of weapon do not violate the right of others . before you respons think about it . do anything you want . if i do not violate anyone then what be the beef ? if i do not break any law or endanger anyone what be the beef ? the safe storage and handling of cannon , cannon propellant , and cannon ammo be well know . they can be store in place typical of home without violate the right of others . btw a cannon be not a weapon . it be consider a ' firework ' by the atf . ever see a civil war renactment ? lot of cannon ? so yes have a cannon in your front yard do fly .	0

as do you . you seriously want to dictate to others that your opinion be the truth . i be sure you find a lot of thing amuse , give your warped view on thing . actually i think that what a lot of the 55 - 60 % of the country who oppose gay marriage find , be that if they join an internet site , that they will be viciously attack by gay marriage supporter . that ' s what most of you be really like . there really be not much of an anti - gay movement , except a handful of people and a few commercial . your vilification of them be typical of most far left gay marriage supporter . actually , what gay marriage proponent simply want be to be treat like every one else . deny the right to marriage because of his / her sexual orientation make them second class citizen . the supporter of the anti - gay movement simply want to impose their moral value on to the rest of the public , the recent prop 8 ballot initiative prove it . ever read john locke or j mill ? you should , it ' s what our country ideal be base on . you have your bubble and i have mine so just leave me alone ; and the majority be never always right and should not have a say in what be moral or just base on their belief .	0

no . it would show that the government actually oppose the hostage taker . over the last generation or so , the dutch become quite good at rescue hostage from the hijacked train that become an annual event ; the russian lose a number of hostage in a theater a few year ago when the gas they use prove a bit strong ; and the filipino become notorious for lose all hostage . but in every case where hostage be lose , the government be criticize for lack of competence rather than complicity . in iran , the mullah be tacitly complicit in the crime . surrender to terrorism , such as you propose , do not work in the real world - it only encourage the terrorist . the iranian govenment be visibly anti - american . do the filipino and dutch case have that component ? i be still quite convinced that american would hate iran just as much as they accidentally cause american casualities .	0
lol . that ' s silly . scientific fact keep changing , because they keep build on what be prove . the actual basis for the fact have not change at all , merely the new accepted idea be . as time progress that idea be test , test , test and test again until it be prove . your statement reveals sheer ignorance as to the scientific process . the fact that some scientist totally dismiss god be proof of there ignorance of scientific method . there be grow evidence to support the existence of a supreme be , and a lot of scientist be ignorant of this fact , yet they accept theory from the quantum level wich be not proven beyond the proof of the existence of god . mayabe your mind isnt as close as others i have speak with on this subject . i do believe in scientific method , but i also have faith that god be out there .	0

first of all , we be suppose to be introduce ourselves , not start up a topic . but let me kill two bird with one stone here . hi everyone , i be new here . and i love to debate . i get kick out of one debate , because i win the debate on linguistics , and the girl get mad , because she lose , and ban me from the froum . hopefully no one here be as immature as that . but anyway , thats my story , i be glad to be here . and i be ready to debate . and here be my first victim . i be against gay marriage . why ? ! because in order to mantain a healthy environment for child . ( which they always seem to want to adopt ) there have to be a healthy relationship . now a child grow up , and see two men / woman date eachother . that can confuse the child as to whether they should also be gay . it be not only harmful to the family environment , but also to society . and do not hand me that , `` my uncle be gay . `` stuff . i have ( he pass away ) a gay uncle , have three gay cousin , and a gay aunt . not my whole family be not gay , but it seem like i have quite a few in my family . now i do not support what they do . even though i love them because they be my family , i would not support them if they be to marry . and what evidence do you have that have two gay parent would confuse a child about weahter they should be gay ? do you know that the same percentage of child that be bring up by gay couple turn out to be gay as child who be bring up by straight couple ? i would say that destroy your conception that the kid would be confuse . i know a number of people who be bring up by commit gay couple ( admittedly not many ) , and not one of the one i know turn out to be gay .	0

i do not see that either of them be `` protest `` . i would however say that they be both make a statement . cindy even make it clear in her letter that she be make a statement . now i certainly think that cindy should have be simply remove rather than arrest , but whats do be do . i be glad to see that the senator wife be remove as well . i have nothing against the position express on either of their shirt . i do however believe that the only one who should be make a statement at the sotu be the president , and therefore i would in the future support the removal of anyone who follow this path . perhaps a dress code would eliminate this x in the future . apparently decorum mean nothing anymore . true they should have pass raincoat and knee boot to protect people clothes from the x that the president be spew out .	1

when rep . carson gather reporter around him to spread the myth of racial slur be hurl “ fifteen time ” he paint the protester not just as racist , but as a terrorist threat . we know this , because kerry picket of the washington time record rep . carson as he explain it all to eager reporter . kerry picket ( wash . time ) : do you think the people outside be generally dangerous or no ? rep . carson : oh absolutely . i work in homeland security . i be from intelligence , and i will tell you , one of the large threat to our internal security … i mean terrorism have an islamic face , but it really come from racial supremacist group . ( inaudible ) its the kind of thing we keep a threat assessment on record [ for ] . picket : from group like this ? rep . carson : oh absolutely . no need for further evidence why this law would be dangerous to those who do not think exactly like you do ! instead of call it a government terrorist watch list , we should just drop the pretension and call it what it would be come . the democrat political enemy terrorist wish list ! : lol : bloomberg : deny second amendment to people on terror watch list	1
all of the british paper keep go on about how bad it be , how more people than ever be be gun down in the street , how gun be be import into britain and resold through underground channel , how criminal employ young woman to act as gun mule for transport and storage , etc . now who should we believe more , your or the paper that relate the news to us ? be that a trick question ? no , the tabloid and other gutter press keep go on about how bad it be , because they sell paper by fan fear and hatred , and fear of crime be one of their big market . yes there have be an increase in gun crime over the year , but that ' s largely attributable to increased attractiveness of crime in a society where social mobility have come to a standstill . in any case the number of incident where firearm be use in crime be still very small , which be why every time someone get shot it be headline news . gun be incredibly rare in this country , the only time i have see gun in real life ( other than air rifle ) be on a military base .	0
genisis include many event and personel that have be prove to take place and live . why would a book be right about the life and event record in it and wrong about origin . because the men who write it mix their mythology in with their hero . the first 11 chapter of genesis be obviously mythology . and if what you say be true , then i guess that mean that the illiad be historical . why would homer be right about some life and event , but wrong about others ? and of course , there be other part of the bible that be pure fiction - jonah and job for example .	0
i have have some experience with this topic . my father be murder when i be 12 , the perp be convict a year later and be charge with 1 st degree murder and sentence to death . flash forward 24 year he run his course of appeal and every legal proceeding you can imagine . his lawyer after 20 year of him be on death row come up with ' retardation ' mind you he ' walk ' 3 time . all of which i be there to witness . i be to be a witness to the execution by request of my grandmother who have pass on . anyway at the last minute he get a stay of execution . back to the draw table . last year after several hearing , they come to the conclusion the he be mentally retarded . score a 75 on his iq test . the limit for the death penalty be 70 . he be a high school graduate , have a family , hold job . and clearly competent , nonetheless they find him otherwise . so now he be off death row , and the da have tell me that it be possible he could get parole eventually . with all that it have be a very try time for me and i have have to struggle with how i really felt about the death penalty . i have be a supporter but never really could my put heart into my conviction . i do not know if it be out of revenge or not , hard to say i be too close to the matter . but i do feel let down when they take him off death row , now i feel like there will never be justice . i put so many year of wait for that moment . it sound kind of sick , but as much as i dread witness it , i also look forward to it . i do think that maybe life in prison may be good , only if his experience there be just awful . but the revenge side of me , just want him to suffer what my father suffer . but if you be to ask me to think about this the old fashion way , which would be i should be the one to flip the switch . not so sure i could do it . so with all that i still do not really know if i in my heart , support the death penalty or i be just after revenge . the victim of violence i would imagine go through this struggle . side note . the man who murder my father also kill a young girl when he be a minor . he have escape from the correctional facility he be in . and it be several year later when he kill my dad . so sorry , anastasia . that ' s a horrible thing to face . and now , use that excuse ? what ! if justice be swift for the guilty then he would not have escape only to do it again . some criminal never change , and via your testimony , only live to do it again . there be some who need to be put to death . your situation make me shudder , anastasia . but , i be glad you do not let it ( revenge ) effect you to the point of take his life yourself . if it would have be my father , those many year ago , i can not say that i would have wait , nor would have accept that lame excuse of retardation . i could very well be in prison myself .	0

well you can thank god for that then , because what you be propose for single payer be some of the most ridiculous stupidity i ' d ever see . whenever anyone want to discuss it rationally you ' d just spam the board with another petition ' 72 % of single mother support single payer ! 84 % of single mother reject raise tax to pay for single payer ! therefore we should go single payer ! ' i even recall you once berate steve for argue in his own word instead of link to a poll to support him . why do you think those number be relevant ? popularity be not a magic power that turn bad policy into good . if i be spamming a petition , then you be spamming paul krugman , darling . and i have put up plenty of rational argument with citation . you , on the other hand , have yet to propose one reason why single payer be ridiculous . because we elect representative to do what we say , not what the lobbyist bribe them to do . you still have not say anything besides ' stupid ' , ' ridiculous ' , and ' maoist ' or ' socialist ' , which be usually what people say about the few politician who be not on the take . emoticonxgood	0

reading back through this thread , i realize that i must have miss this post . i be glad you post it because although the post be ridiculous , it nevertheless have comedic value . can the government tell someone that they can not beat their child , even if they choose to beat them only in the privacy of their own home ? and far than that , it be an obvious fact that just because something should be in the constitution do not mean it actually be in the constitution . be you tell me that my pubes be sentient ? i agree , however i be no constitutional expert .	1

this post contain a perfectly simple explanation of why toe be a sham along with a challenge to any darwinist to prove me wrong . toe be construct on a fraud premise . this premise say that the fundamental unit of evolution be the gene . whenever an evolutionist talk about “ evolution ” he ' s not talk about mere phenotypic change – he ' s talk about change in gene . to a darwinist , just because an animal change phentoypically , or even if he pass these change down to progeny do not mean that “ evolution ” have occur . a fish could morph into a human , but if there be no change in gene then this would not be consider `` evolution . `` the only way evolution can happen , by their own definition , be if there be a change in genetics . this premise , i suggest be a complete and total fraud . and i will explain why now : let us take human and dog , for example . when compare side - by - side , sure enough , human may have an assortment of gene that dog do not – and possibly the other way around . but just because human may have certain gene that dog do not , do not mean that these gene cause the difference between human and dog . of course , there be no “ dog gene ” or “ human gene . ” but likewise there be no “ tongue gene , ” “ tail gene ” or “ toenail gene . ” part be not translate gene . thus , the assertion that new gene get create or that individual gene mutate over time to chnage one kind of animal into another be blatantly false and physically impossible . but it ' s bad than that . as i say before , human have a whole slew of gene – theoretically , at least - - that dog ( or other animal ) do not have . but evolutionist still contend that these genetic difference cause the difference between the organism ! that ' s why they analyze dna with such scrutiny ! but do it ever dawn on them that study genetics be a compete waste of time because of the real possibility that each dog or each human have the gene they have because of what they be ? scientist have be tell us for decade that who or what we be be determine by what gene we have . but they have get it backwards ! instead , we have the gene we have because of who we be . a dog be not a dog because he bark ; a dog bark because of what he be . same with gene . this , of course , spell destructin to toe because it mean genetic evolution be a fraud . evolution , thus , should not be a theory base on change in gene , but a theory base on change in trait . but scientist continue to mess around with gene and try to make the body do weird thing by mutate them . they simply will not give up because they have see correlation between gene activity and various physiological response . but here ' s where they be screw everything up : when you be a kid do you ever stand on your head ? if so , do your face ever get red if you stay upside down for a period of time ? if so , do you admit that it be the act of be upside down that cause the blood to rush to your head ? or , do you have the audacity to claim that you be upside down because your face be red ? that ' s excactly what science be do with genetics : they have get the audacity to claim that change in gene ( the red face ) be cause the organsim to change physiologically ( go upside down . ) in reality , what ' s happening be the organism be experience a new environment ( turn upside down ) and then the gene be respond in kind ( turn red ) . the only way you can prove this logic wrong be to do one of two thing : 1 ) show me conclusively that mutation happen completely randomly and unoriented to environmental pressure . 2 ) show me that the same environmental pressure on gene will not produce the exact same physiological effect over and over and over . so there it be . go for it . so what this guy be say be that he believe in natural selection but not evolution ?	0
interest that those three be also the weak and rarest of argument when argue for gun control . in fact , i have never witness anyone base their entire gun control argument on the fact that ' gun owner lack the testicular fortitude to fight someone in hand - to - hand combat .

originally post by simone i rather think that the incidence of abortion be far low in europe owe to their high standard of sex education and access to contraception without the impede hypocrisy of american religious culture . simone be quite right . woman will no longer breed to order accord to the dictats of outdated religion . british muslim woman will follow at some point ( many already be ) . there be a few hothead extremist who sit on london street corner with placard state that `` uk will be islamic `` , `` sharia law for uk `` etc . etc . but those nutter be ignore along with all the other ( non - religious ) nutter currently walk the street of london .

this be what i do not understand . on the one hand we have iranian go on about death to america . on the other our own president be constantly make statement about spread democracy and topple current regime in the me . be one any bad than the other ? i still contend that mad solve most of the problem with nuclear proliferation . sure , some of the iranian be crazy ( as be some american leader ) , but they be not stupid . they be not go to use nuke as offensive weapon if it be go to ensure their own destruction in retaliation . remind me of the cold war clamor of necessary ' defense ' nuclear weapon parity with russia . consider the threat we make directed towards iran and others along with our occupation of iraq , i be surprise our conceit have not make all of me and asia scramble for nuke . pakistan , 97 % muslim , hide bin laden , govern by a general constantly avoid assassination attempt , never a bad word about that us ' ally ' . but they have nuke and delivery system . i ' d think iran believe , as we have show , that the us do not spew the democracy at the point of a gun policy to those nation possess nuclear weapon .	0
if you think evolution can not explain any change then why pick the avian lung in particular ? maybe try and show how genesis can integrate almost or more observation in a meaningful way than evolution , then genesis competes , otherwise it do not . because if evolution can not explain all change it be false , unless you propose some creature evolve and some be specially create . be that what you mean ? genesis say that all creature be specially create . it fit with the observational evidence but there be no smoking gun that prove it . statis be the norm not the exception . one be right the other wrong . it can not be both way . do you have an answer to how a lizard can morph into a bird consider the amazing difference in the lung ?	0

but by that definition , either one could be view as impede on religious freedom , include your view impede on hers ! we do not define impose on religious freedom on the basis of have different ideal . it do not effect your religion or religious freedom if you do not get benefit under gay marriage . you can argue in other way , on other basis , but the idea that not give gay marriage benefit be impose on religious freedom be an empty ' argument ' . but you have not show how she would be harm by equal marriage ? i have show that her definition infringe upon my religious freedom . if gay marriage become a reality then in no way do it infringe upon her in any way . would you care to explain how gay marriage infringe upon her in any way ? it be her heterosexual privledge and her sence of entitlement that she be protect not marriage .	0

* * nonsense . that may be what you suppose exterrestrial life to be like , and as you be a materialist / mechanist , i be not surprise to hear you say it . but i demand to see all of the intrinsic life function that be in my posted definition , include within a complex , self - aware , self - organizing , self - supporting , self - serve system , before i confuse any artefact with a genuinely live organism . * * i would not bet the farm on that , but even if true , it ' s the function and what enable those function that count , not the construction material involve . * * energy , mass . inertia , and all of the four material force be no more empirically observable than the life force , but you can infer them from their observed effect upon corporeal matter ; just as you can observe the effect of the life force upon corporeal matter . deny life and you can deny gravity by the exact same token . but you do so at peril of make a fool of yourself . * * only upon a cursory examination that be unjustifiably satisfy with appearance . sort of like think that a carney magician really can work miracle , or get fool by movie effect . only bad . * * only obliquely , as all of the artefact of true living thing do . in that sense , ' life ' have a real effect upon it , since life create and maintain it for life ' s ( i . e . , its creator ' s ) purpose . * * that , too . * * what you materialist / mechanist always fail to understand be that ' chemical interaction ' be merely observed fact . they do not explain anything , include themselves . what they really do , be to require explain themselves . * * nothing at all , provide you do not reduce the whole of reality , and its content , to bit of stuff that get move in space from one point to another , and on and on . oops ! that ' s materialist / mechanist ontology in a nutshell , and so that ' s exactly what you do believe ! * * there be none , because it be not . check the definition of ' life ' . your little toy do not fit it any good than a child ' s ' wet itself ' doll ' appear ' to have a function metabolic system . let us get real from now on , shall we ? ww , be you talk to yourself ? if not , then please learn how to attribute statement to the person who make them .	1
in the quote which you reference , the bottom line be `` the point at which we assign right be a matter of opinion . `` that be part of what we be debate in the abortion debate . however , unlike the term person or the idea about when right begin , the term genocide be not a matter of opinion and it do have a very specific definitive meaning , as define in the definition post over the last few page . i say that your claim of abortion be genocide be untrue and unsupported by logical arguement . it do not match that definition . you be the one who be spout the importance of be definitive , yet the only support that you have give be gross distortion of the actual definition . it be support , i have show that it be true . your only argument be to claim that organisation that perpetrate genocide do not agree that it be genocide . wow what an argument you have .	1

the fact that america need a republican congress be evidence by the past record of the two major party . thing take a turn for the bad everytime the liberal get control . liberalism be a mental disorder . i agree . hence why we need to evict the gop from the congress today it be evident by the liberal history of the gop majority that they can not be trust with money , with the size of government , with foreign relation , with underage page , with the military in general , with privacy , civil right or even the most basic function of congress : oversight . liberalism need to be evict from congress , therefore the republican need to go . it never stop bother me that more democrat vote aganist the schavio bill then republican . democrats more conservative then republicans ? well . give how far republicans have go over i can not say i be surprise .	0
of course it will have an effect on the gay marriage issue . it will prevent the people of mass from vote on the issue and place the final decision in the hand of the pro gay democratic legislature who be own and control by the gay lobby . it should also be note that accord to the mass constitution , the people have always vote on such issue . the democratic party control government want to change the constitution against the will of the people who want to vote on this important issue . it ' s just another example of the liberal hijack the historical political process and reform it in their own image . but if this be a republican program , you ' d have no problem with it . you be a rightwing hypocrite , archie baby .	1

everyone together now . `` straw man `` you should watch where you cast stone , kido . your original post be an example of a straw man . not mine . you should be more careful before operate a gun . you just yourself in the foot . lol !	1
i wasn ' t oversimplify anything , only state the obvious in that a whack job intent on murder people can do it very effectively without a gun . but by disarm honest people as you would do , you insure that criminal who have no respect for the law will remain the only people arm in our society once the law abide people willingly give theirs up . that will be a time to truly worry about our personal safety since we all know the police only respond to crime commit but can not prevent crime from occur as it ' s happen since most violent crime take place in private setting . you anti - second amendment mooks simplify the issue by think that disarm good people who own weapon will somehow change the nature of all men . if you look at the rate of violent crime in nation with stricter gun law you will see that on a per caput basis violent crime be just as high as they be here . it ' s just that more people die from stabbings and beating than do here . but when all be say and do , dead be dead be dead . emoticonxbanghead i be not argue that gun control will change the nature of men - though gun may make them more willing and confident to engage in crime . with guns criminal can do even more damage . add gun to crime be like add gasoline to a fire - it make an already exist problem worse . if you think that just as many people die from stab and beating in other developed nation as people die from gun in the us then you need to do more research .	0

that be nothing but conjecture . be you tell me that arctic fox at some point in history do not have this ability ? actually , it ' s not conjecture . the genetic makeup of the several subspecies of arctic fox bear it out . the dominant allele be rare because it be less adaptive . the dominant allele be most likely ancestral . but even fox below the arctic circle show difference in their fur between summer and winter . so yes , fox that be able to change color in the north have a differential reproductive advantage over those who could not .	0

bryan make a good point though . bloomberg be basically try to suggest that if we get tough on gun law here in virginia that the crime rate in new york city would go down . this be pretty doubtful . you never really see someone go ' man , i ' d x your head off but gun be too expensive ' . instead , people be just smart enough to get gun where it be easy . should those 10 state suddenly become the hard state to get gun in than you ' d see 10 other state be on that list with the exact same crime rate . the reason we can tell this be that virginia and those other name state do not have high crime rate than the city with strict gun law . i do not think much can be infer about the relationship between gun and crime by compare the crime rate of a densely populated city with the crime rate of a whole state . virginia have a high homicide rate that most canadian province which be probably a good comparison - homicide offence , number and rate , by province and territory be it possible to make it much hard for criminal to obtain gun ? yes , i think so . if your boat be sink then you have to plug all the leak not just some of them . if you keep plug the leak then eventually you will reach a state in which significantly few criminal be obtain gun . why do i say this ? because significantly few criminal be obtain gun in developed country with stricter and more consistent gun law . in the us , there be too much inconsistency in gun law .	0

plus there be so many other science that be lump with evolution , incorrectly by those who do not understand evolution . talk about the evolutionist theory about the big bang be pretty mindless , since the big bang be cosmology . whether or not there be or be not a big bang be irrelevant to evolutionary biology . lump other science under `` evolution `` be a method of creationists so that they can claim that they do not oppose `` science `` but only evolution . to be a creationist be to reject the last 400 year of science - cosmology , astronomy , astrophysics , nuclear physic , geology , paleontology , tectonics , biogeography , genetics , population genetics , and so on . you get the idea .	0

sheer nonsense . what couints be the functioning of the system as a whole . reduce it to subsytems , and those subsystem to material and mechanical component , be a task subordinate to the principal , primary objective , i . e . , an understanding of the whole , * * this be the best response you have get ? ! what a loser ! 	0
i can appreciate this slant , however i think that a true feminist approach would be to support woman who want their pregnancy by find solution to the reason they feel an abortion would be their best choice . if we want to have a child , society should be back us up on that . instead , i see such a stigma for single mother , i see single mother unable to finish school , i see single mother unable to work a decent job b / c of either lack of education or lack of child care , i see system where the men do not have to support , violence , et cetera . that ' s not something you can really blame on the pro - life movement . in fact , a lot of effort in the pro - life movement do go into help single mother . many pro - life counseling service help single mother offer support in a variety of way , include financially .	0
ssues i raise in my op regard the initial formation of breast . what issue ? you drivel on about breast form on lizard ( even though the most primitive milk secretor we have today do not have anatomically distinct mammary gland , and the early mammal evolve from reptile not remotely like lizard ) , then triumphantly crown your straw man with what you seem to think be a knock - down point about nerve connection . yes , ss , the most primitive milk - secrete structure we know be modify sweat gland ; your incredulity do not alter that fact one iota . and guess what ? sweat gland have nerve connection to the hypothalamus . 	0

actually it be . you keep argue that everyone who disagree with you be an atheist , when they clearly be not . the rest of my signature back that up . furthermore , your constantly claim about your religious rightness fail due to the simple fact that your religion be not the only religion . try and comprehend this child , your siggy be your opinion . it be evidence of nothing real or imagine . only in your mind do it prove anything at all .	1
sorry , i expand my definition here and be not polite enough to inform the rest of you happy i be not mean to say just that nothing would be do about global warming ( though i see now that it certainly appear that way ) . i be say nothing will be do period . no preparation , nothing . we will wait until it be too late , act surprise when it happen , and then blame either the mexican or the chinese . it be what we do . as in we , do you mean we the usa or we , the world ? because this be a world wide issue and not something the us can solve on its own in any case .	0
every system have its flaw . do that mean that we should abolish every system ? no , we should not abolish every flawed system . however , when the flaw result in put innocent people to death , it be not worth the risk . in 26 year the death penalty have be in effect in my home state of illinois , there have be more people exonerate due to irrefutable evidence than have be put to death . i think that constitute a serious problem .	0

yes , we do . and the truth be a person , jesus christ ( john 14 : 6 ) . have any major truth concern jesus ' life , death , or resurrection in the new testament ever be show to have be substantially change or prove wrong ? no ! if you claim otherwise , prove it . one other thing : when be the book of the new testament write ? scholar give their expert opinion : date the nt too bad you be so steep in denial over christ that you can not see the forest for the tree . 1 john 2:22 - 23 : ' who be the liar ? it be the man who deny that jesus be the christ . such a man be the antichristhe deny the father and the son . no one who deny the son have the father ; whoever acknowledge the son have the father also . ' jesus be lord ! other than show your ability to bold your false or irrelevant claim what be accomplish here ? as for the date that the nt book be write , more importance could be give to those guess if any still exist or if early christian could have refrain from change the word of god . sorry current christian do it also so unfair to blame just the early one .	1
homosexual be attract to adult of the same sex . pedophile be attract exclusively to child . there be people , such as the case with these priest , who molest child , who be not pedophile . molestation , like rape , be not about sexual attraction . it be violence . people do not molest or rape because they be so turn on they can not help themselves , they do it to hurt somebody . get some information before shoot off at the mouth vor . most of those priest be probably niether gay nor pedophile . i hate it - when people spread this * * * * . it be false information that do nothing but harm . it put blame on the innocent while the guilty get ignore and child get hurt . do not use this lie to justify your bigotry - for you do so at the cost of innocent people - adult and child . when you have no constructive comment just attack the messenger with your insultsand name call . typical . so very sad . its radical like you that hurt the cause of gay right . 	0

what ' s this to do with gun ? this have everything to do with gun , how be these people suppose to protect themselves ? since the police have be tell to just let them go , crime will run rampant , it will become the place to go if you feel like duing a little robbery a little burglary , gosh wonder if they get ta let rapo ' s and killer runaway to . only 2000 ? i live in george wa . and the population be less than 2000 , it be also just off i - 90 and we have plenty of crime from people pass through not necessarily from people who live there .	0
though just in the case of an accident where maybe an old sibling have carelessly leave one lie around , it be understandable that mistake happen . i would simply continue along with the `` scale down version `` and say that it ' s something such as a `` gasket for seal off biological contaminant `` . now a response like this would confuse a child and go way over his / her head , though an adult could get a chuckle out of it , know the inside joke . see above . give kid credit . you give them a bogus answer and they will know . we have get to stop treat sex like a dirty little secret .	0

if there ' s one thing i can count on , it ' s your insistence on 100 % , beyond any possibility of apologetic excuse creation , demand for absolute proof ( with video - tape ) if anything involve criticism of christianity or evangelicals or some association thereof . and if there ' s one thing i can count on , it ' s your insistence that we can assume guilt and should make a public spectacle of the matter before even investigate any matter .	1
currently , in the u . s . , when you buy a gun , you do not get it right away . it have to be register and if you pass a sanity check , they will approve it . it be because of this registration process that illegal gun be bring into the country and sell . , illegally . if you ban gun , this black market will flourish and the number of unregistered gun will increase . the crazy that want to shoot up a bunch of people will still be able to get a gun . i prefer regulation over make thing illegal and ban them . i also prefer freedom over safety . but hey . , that ' s just me . , well . , me and a bunch of craze , gun packing , red blood american wink oh yeah you be right ! i suppose only sane american get gun ! no wonder 0 % of the population be kill in gun warfare . oh wait , a considerable amount of people be kill by gun . silly me ! of course all the sane people can also shoot who they want in some state , just because they feel threaten by it . sure keep gun , advocate them why do not you . after all , all those people kill , and the family of those people . have not happen to you , so why should you care ? !

no , of course sexuality be not strictly about behavior . the point be that religious belief about behavior be about behavior . of course i agree with you about sexuality , but that be a different issue . the point be that it be not innateness that be oppose by religion . it be a behavioral issue . say something someone do be immoral be not the same as say they be immoral . i do appreciate your point while i disagree on principle . i guess it boil down to the fact that even if i believe in a god i could not accept that he would command us to suppress our true innate nature . why would he make us that way and then expect such a thing ? christian especially be indoctrinate from early on with the notion that that be exactly what god command . to suppress a good many natural inclination . to accept that we be sinful by nature and need to be punish , our nature bring to heel .	0

it would also make what appear to be immediate `` jump `` in the fossil record - - which fit in nicely with what ' s be report . it ' s also a natural , orderly process that play out possible variation on a theme , make the organism not inherently stupid and clueless , but more like a creative artist . so now you want to demonstrate that you be also ignorant of the fossil record ?	1
go ahead , delude yourselves . that ' s what you do best . emoticonxrolleyes i love it when straight , christian folk who disapprove of gay seem to know so much about what it be to be gay - how it feel , how they become that way , the nature of their relationship and whether or not its something they can control . hey archangel - if you ever need brain surgery i know a fantastic auto mechanic you can talk to . emoticonxrolleyes	1
there be a catagory 5 hurricane back about 105 year ago that hit texas . as long as catagory 5 hurricans have be happen , it do not make sence that catagory 5 s be create by a cold war device . now the fact that there be a hurricane in the pacific ocean ( it ' s name a boy name that start with the letter ' m ' . hurricane be not suppose to happen in the pacific ocean . the fact that a hurricane be in the pacific ocean when usually in the pacific ocean be a typhoon ( and a cyclone over austrailia ) suggest something odd . emoticonxwow so , global warming no , but weather control device , yes ? perhaps too many people be play red alert these day . 	1
i have to ask : have you actually read what you just quote ? i know that must sound rude , but i can not for the life of me see the connection with the rest of the thread - or indeed any of the point you be try to make . non - random ( or environmentally cue ) amount of variation be not the same as directed variation . nor be there any reason to believe that these genetically regulate ' responsive ' rate of mutation do not arise , originally , as a random mutation themselves . you be clearly very excited about something , but i can not see what it be ; sorry ! and can you please tell me the difference between nonrandom variation and direct variation ? i ' d also like a link to verify what you say . thank you . god bless !	0
what be the reason which you would present behind the statement `` all human life be sacred `` ( or whichever similar statement you think be the core of your pro - life stance ) ? because to not view it as sacred present a great potential for harm . people sometimes to take a disposable view of thing that they consider unimportant . to view humanity as sacred help protect humanity .	0
who would not choose to go to heaven if such a place actually exist ? there be no lock on the pearly - gate . that be what it mean to be all - loving and all - forgiving as well . i know , you be go to say that people be refuse to go when they do not accept god , jesus into their life . that be irelevant . you be place that condition on it again and thus cheapen it . good question . its not a condition , i do not agree . jesus do not open the lock to the pearly - gate for some people , he be the gate . do you see what i mean ? that ' s what he say , ' i be the way . no one come to the father except through me ' . i think its like say you should not put condition on the way into a house , you should be able to walk in from any spot - and say that have to go through the door be a condition . why would people not choose heaven ? its a hard road .	0

well , if all you care be yourself and you be not burden by conscience , go ahead and abort whenever it be expedient . i can see that you be so badly scar by your bad choice in men , and your rape , that ' control over your body ' have become paramount to you . it be understandable to give your son a homosexual as substitute father ? i be not so sure about that . typical pro - life , woman - hat schmuck . i be pro - choice so i must be selfish whore who abort all the time . you be not worth the energy it take to type . i be sure its no great than your own . i mean , only a scarred woman could want autonomy , right ? real woman should be door mat , that way you do not ever have to attempt be a real man . way way over the line . he be an amazing , committed , loving , amaze father . maybe you , like my ex - husband , think be father be about who you # # # # . and like him , you probably think thats also where it end as well . both myself and my son ' s adopt ( real ) father have high standard than that .	1
okay , here ' s the hypothesis i pull out of my rear . long ago , some female begin to wear primordial shoe . the newly evolve shoe - wear gene be select for , as female with leather booty be less likely to cut their foot and acquire a deadly infection . this prolonged lifespan set up a selective pressure to develop a shoe fetish among male . male who become attract to the booty would be at an advantage , as they would more likely impregnate the bootie woman who in turn would be more likely to survive to take care of their sperm product . your hypothesis fall apart with your first statement . we all know that it would have be impossible for only `` some `` of them to have shoe . if one have them , then you can pretty much guess they all . just have to have them . now you make no inference to men have shoe . here we can agree . woman probably do invent shoe what be your theory about the foot fetish gene ?	1
if the uk be consistant then you may have a point . but you anti - social , socialist tyranny of a government arrest and jail tony martin for the crime of self defense and they let the burgular go free . not only free but your court deem that tony martin make the `` environment hazardous to the burgular trade `` tony martin who have never be charge with a crime be serve how many year ? ( 10 plus ? ) while the home invader get out in less than 1 and continue his trade . the problem though be that you worry about a 12 year old with a water pistol as oppose the the criminal invade your home . you live in a sick sad world my friend . no nation be perfect , rev . not even the usa ! a singular instance that you quote be not an argument as anyone can just as easily find criticism with the usa over people free early from jail . you will find black people over - represent in the jail of the uk , the usa and australia . there be injustice everywhere .	0
you do not seem to want a write constitution either , or at least one that be not as vauge as ours . i have gather from your post that you want a direct democracy , where everyone get to vote on each others right . you want the people to be able vote on such issue as abortion , and marriage , you want a tryanny of the majority . any one who want people to be able to vote upon the civil right of another be an enemy of freedom . i do like write constitution very much ; and our constitution be not vague at all . in the first amendment , the question be not whether congress may make a law , but rather what be ' the freedom of the press ? ' this phrase have objective , historic meaning , and obscenity be not cover within that objective , historic meaning . neither , by the way , be the publishing of nuclear secret . you have gather incorrectly , for i do not want a direct democracy . how do you suppose we get ' civil right ' recognize in the constitution to begin with , matthew ? do the word just magically appear there , or do a vast majority of people vote to put them there ? oh yes , that ' s right , a vast majority of people vote to put them there . darn evil democracy ! i say down with majority rule !	1
what about the fact that scientific information allways change to suit what be observe . it isnt consistent . dont get me wrong , i be facinated with science , and agree with a lot of what it have prove , but i dont think that the bible should be discard as a piece of fiction . after all , jesus be a real person . he do exist . do he ? what secular evidence do you have from before 70 c . e . that confirm his existance ? what be the outside verification to the new testament ?	0
i would say that if a diety can not go out of his way to demonstrate his existance and make clear what he want this may surprise you , although we can not observe not test this , god have come down to earth many time throughout human history . your reason for believe this lie entirely within the bible . i hardly consider a 1500 year old book `` make clear what he want `` . particularly give that even among those who believe the book , they still can not agree on what god want . and of course , that do not even beg to address the issue of all the other holy book which contradict the christian bible . you may personally believe that you know what god want , but if so it ' s not because god have be clear about it .	0
cold , again , be just an adjective . if you take a fish from the arctic sea , and put it in some chilled water ( say , 5 degree celcius ) then that fish be go to think it be very hot , despite the fact we would call the water cold . it ' s also a noun . but since you be unable but to repeat your self , maybe a few more time will make it ' true '	1

islam be very clear that mohammed receive the quran from an angel . not god . as you may or may not know , satan be a fallen angel and islam be his religion which be prove by the hate , murder and death that it be build upon and have live by since its founding . islam be no more build on hate , burder and death than christianity be . do i have to remind you of the inquisition , the holy land war , the witch burning , etc ? . if you try to claim that what some islamic people have do represent the whole religion , then i can do the same with those thing that i list , only for the christian faith . and do not even get start again on satan be a fall angel - yes , we know about your belief that angel do not have free will , and yet rebel against god , so we do not need to go into any more of that garbage .	0

from what i can tell , no one have ever say gay family can not come to it . that ' s why the whole thing seem odd to me . what ' s with gay lobbyist and stunt like this ? the white house should just make it invitation - only just to keep something like this from become a political tool . do you read the artical ? to show our child that they be no different then any other .	0
this be another problem with humanism , because there be no moral authority to stop people from do whatever they want to do , hence the adage that humanism be a philosophy that have both foot plant firmly in mid - air the human collective be the authority . one major advantage of this authority over a theistic one be that it actually exist .	0
i have cite several piece of evidence that prove you wrong . you just wish to ignore them as you do everything that contridicts your belief . you have not prove anything . all you have do be spew your same old drivel which ignore what i actually say and reinterpret it to mean what you want it to say . you must corrupt what i say since you can not accept the truth of my belief and win your fallacious argument .	0
you prove my point exactly . just because 99 % of scientist believe in evolution , why should i ? because it ' s a blatantly obvious fact of nature and intellectually honest expert in the field accept it .	0
i do not think that kill people as a form of punishment be set a very good example to the rest of the world - if the public start to see authority give people death penalty , everybody will just think that kill be ok and it will be a vicious circle ! the best way to get through to people , i think , about what they have do wrong in society be by teach / encouraging / inspire them , not kill . if we kill more people that be guilty of their crime more people would not want to commit the crime because of the circumstance . if they do not care about the circumstance they be insane . ' i think , about what they have do wrong in society be by teach / encouraging / inspire them , not kill . ' so you want the government to brainwash them ? be you kid me ? what planet do you live on ? ! ' oh , you kill someone but we be not go to punish you at all you just have to go to therapy .

oh , so now it ' s a fetus ? in your other post it be a `` baby `` cunx . be you be dense on purpose ? i say that i be not all into the semantics of baby / fetus . i will conceid that its kill a baby . the term for it be fetus , fetus ' become baby . i see the logic there ( in fact i think i be agree with you ) . why must you keep pound this drum ?	1
i just wonder why the poll show such support for bush at first , but after the liberal press get their claw in him and begin tear away , suddenly the support waivered . be you gon na tell me that this change in support come from logical think ? c ' mon , i give you a little more credit than that . most american interpret ? geez , most american do not know their a * * from a hole in the ground , they just listen to the sound bytes that be dish out by the liberal press so their support of bush ( so you say ) mean exactly what ? that they be listen to the sound bytes dish out by bush ' s rhetoric ? and where be bush be the man and jim ' s trucking ? usually they be all over it when someone say something bad about the american people . oh , that ' s right . it ' s ok when a person on the right say it , it ' s when it say by a liberal like moore that it become an issue .	0

my point here be that it could be argue very reasonably as to whether or not a fertilized egg , a zygote , an embryo , fetus , etc . , be a someone . sure , but then you get into all sort of problem of classification , slippery slope , and other awkward mess . argue whether an embryo or a fetus be a person seem to raise more trouble than it might solve . it seem well to err on the side of caution and devise a pro - choice argument that assume the embryo or fetus to be a person rather than worry whether they be a person .	0
leviticus 18:22 do not have sexual relation with a man as one do with a woman ; that be detestable . leviticus 20:13 if a man have sexual relation with a man as one do with a woman , both of them have do what be detestable . they be to be put to death ; their blood will be on their own head . i also grab my bible to see what its say in context and it say nothing about temple prostitution or idolatry i love it when hypocrite say that we be no longer old testament law but proceed to quote the old testament that they just dismiss make themselves out to be fool and hypocrite . you can not have it both way . either the old testament applies , or it do not . also , do you play football , wear polyester , stuff like that ? those be abomination too . for more abomination , read leviticus 11 . damn , this be a jolly good time !	1

i see that many of you be busily discuss angel on the head of a pin question . my view be that no man ought to have any opinion whatsoever on a woman ' s decision of whether or not to terminate a pregnancy unless and until she ask him . well that let out most of the supreme court when rvw come up ! and of course 1 / 2 give or take of the voter would be disqualify if relevant issue come up to a vote . perhaps we should start an effort to amend the constitution to incorporate your idea !	1
can you please explain how my view on gun control reveal that i be racist . have i propose a law which would restrict gun usage for only a certain race ? again ? gun control law by design be mean to keep inner city citizen ( i . e . black ) from own gun . liberal term such as `` saturday night special `` all have racist undertone . also since the majority of gun violence in the us be minority on minority . who be these law mean to target ?	0

it ' s a false dichotomy that some critic of religion have cast religion in by say that submit to spiritual authority and think / reasoning be go to be juxtapose . yes . it ' s not logical to simply cite , `` the bible tell me so , the bible be write by god , `` and consider that an argument . the bible have be wrong . it ' s also not logical to cite authority to god . it necessarily beg further question about your god ' s unproven existence to those who do not believe in that god , or in any god . if we do not simply believe in your god , on the basis of your presupposition , he can have no authority over the rest of us . one must come up with another argument . should each religion have it ' s own definition or completely different idea of logic , which favour that religion and its god ?	0
