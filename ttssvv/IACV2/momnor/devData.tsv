you do not answer my question . toe say all structure evolve by small , random modification . surely , then you be not say that whole structure such as foot form complete . that would be a contradiction now would not it . so answer my question : what about the foot ? which foot come first ? there be more to foot and other body part besides bone . muscle , tendon , toenail . do all these evolve at the same time from the same mutation ? . if not , in which order ? as i recall the order of foot be leave front foot , right hind foot , leave hind foot , and finally right front foot . do that make you happy . oh yes the gene involve be know as peds and number in order 1 - 4 . ped1 and ped4 be mirror image of each other ( obtain by a process know as reflective copy ) and ped2 and ped3 be much the same . this be of course entirely logical and could have be direct or random . the first critter to bear such foot be know as the ftse not to be confuse with the index . its predecessor be of course the gimpy series since they have 1,2 , or 3 foot and have to hobble along with what they have . ftse - 1 be sometimes know as pogo because of its odd ' gait ' .	0

sorry to burst your bubble , but non - gene inheritance be non - materiastic inheritance , which absolutely do contradict toe . ( how exactly do it happen that thought or awareness generate a new physical trait and then pass it down ? ) and never have it be proven that any spontaneous , randomly - occur mutation have ever create a beneficial , selectable morphological novelty , so ultimately , it ' s your materialist theory that have no evidence . i have evidence , you do not . honk ! wrong . my parent inherit a house from their parent . they also inherit knowledge and be teach certain value . concept store in one brain , express via word and encode in a new brain . epigenetic inheritance , yet still materialistic . do not mean they do not also inherit a bunch of gene , and for the umpteenth time it do not mean they get to screw their face up like hiro and tweak them whenever they like . should not i be ask you that , since that ' s what you say happens , despite have exactly zero evidence to back it up ? honk ! what a great big fat juicy lie , s . do not put it in the keep net though ; toss it back so you can use it again later .	1

actually there be a good solution . mandatory male and female birth control pill , financial penalty if you stop take . anyone who would get off the pill would want a kid , therefore , abortion would cease . so we would penalize financially those who want to have kid ?	0
do local civilian firearm regulation apply to soldier on military base ? can soldier bring their private firearm on base ? i think not . no its federal property and fall under ar190 - 11 and other applicable regulation . if they live off post i believe so if they follow policy and regulation . if they live on post then the pow must be store in unit arm room and only draw out with the commander ' s permission .	0

see the comment section on the blog entry i link to , particuarly stuart ' s own comment . `` yes , you register online , but the initial invitation be by invite only . you register who be come in your invited group , not just “ first come , first serve . ” there ' s a lot of discussion there on that issue . but it really do not matter - - a private screening of a film be a private screening - - they can boot anyone out that they want . i do not say anything about anyone ' break the law . ' i be just show you a different perspective of the event from a witness - - you know , give you more information from which to draw conclusion . or do you only want your information limit to one version of the story , mainly from the account of the one who get boot ? i think it be simply a private screening , and the people run the private screening do not want them there . that ' s their prerogative , as it be obviously a private screening and that ' s the way it work . again , read the comment on the blog i link to as they include comment from people who be there , include more from stuart and at least one by pz myers himself . hey , as collin say , p.z . register , and get it . i would say that boot him out be the height of hypocrisy . it confirm to be that it be base on a lie , and the producer know it . the movie be make a claim that the ' opposition ' be silence i.d . , and the presentation of alternate idea . yet , what do they do ? they kick someone out they interview for the movie ( base on false pretense to be sure , but they do pay him for appear in the movie ) . that sound that they be the one try to suppress oppose idea , not science . yes , they have the legal right . but , boy do it put egg on their face , consider everything . it show them to be hypocrite and liar .	0
funny that all proponent of abortion for unwanted pregnancy talk about abortion as if be a political statement : i control my body . funny that they never think that the reason most woman need an abortion be because they could not control their leg and keep them cross . they can not control their lust , so much for body control . emoticonxrolleyes which , we suppose , in your mind release the sperm donor of any responsibility whatsoever , right ? be not it interest that your solution for the abortion issue demand that woman deny their sexuality while permit men to run the gamut of theirs . do this attitude , of which you be not the only proponent , stem from a hatred or a fear of woman ?	0
when we demean the holocaust , and the symbol support it , we begin to erase those lesson . so you be say we should try and forget about it ? learn about the holocaust be great , and as horrible as it sound it be probably for the good that it happen . why do i say this ? well if it have not happen then it would have happen eventually ( almost everyone hated jew , black and homosexual at the time ) , and it happen teach us a valuable lesson . it ' s horrible to look at it like that ; but it be quite true , whether you think so or not . we need thing like this to happen in order to grow and develop and mature as a specie . wow , i do not understand how this keep happen . i will try to switch mouse .	1
no no no . the concept that these three reference be all ' god ' come later . it be not implicit in the bible unless you assume it be in the bible . if they be use in reference to god , then how can you possibly say they do not refer to god ? jesus himself say he he and his father be one , in john 10:30 . and the three appear together numerous time in parallel grammatical construction , denote equality . it ' s a harder argument to make that the three be not god and that any one be less than the other in term of divinity , than to say they be god .	0
well , since we do not have to treat people equally , i see nothing wrong with make all people age 14 - 16 slave . ( i doubt anyone will be against this anyway . ) but moreover , since we be not equal , we can make woman have pregnancy and disallow abortion . right ? now obviously i think everyone be equal . personally i do not see someone that make 1 million a year any different then someone that be homeless . i guess this explain the devaluing of like though sad that do not suprise me . again i be not surprised that your first reaction to the idea that people be not equal would be to enslave some and that your second idea would be to subjegate woman . this reveal way too much about your nature . it ain ' t pretty . try live homeless for a year then get back to me on whether you saw yourself as equal to someone on ' 1 million a year ' emoticonxrolleyes now if the ' 1 million a year ' person give the homeless person 1 / 2 million a year , then they would be equal , because equality be at the entre of such socialist ideal .	1
each side try to support their own worldview . there be two position , and side be choose . it ' s human nature . yes . happy i can only speak for myself - win convert be what the bible suggests , but i do not believe in do it in a forceable way . i do not believe one person / one event win a convert all at once , it take a combination of many tiny little step ( example ) to win convert . my main reason for post here be political . i do not believe it ' s possible to have neutrality in government . if church & state be separate , atheism and state be combine . atheism almost always equal secular `` progression `` , and judeo christianity almost always equal tradition , accord to unchanging biblical moral . the two quickly clash in politics . also , i do not believe future generation ( school child ) be have the gap in godless evolution explain to them clearly enough . i enjoy write debate very much , and i be try to show how evolution can establish atheism in the u.s. government , in violation of the text of the first amendment and intent of the framer . i believe there have to be a god because i see no compelling evidence that life spontaneously generate from non living chemical . i be bring up without anyone force me what to believe , and go to church occasionally . my church attendance do not get very regular until my late twenty - about twenty year ago . a few bible study , compare it to the flow of event , the nature of people , my shortcoming , the shortcoming of science etc , convince me . though it do not really say why , the bible say that be what will happen . see matthew 7 : 13,14 . it ' s part of god ' s plan . free will . very well say , but remember , evolution doesnt mean atheism , but creationism mean religion . i know christian that believe in evolution , but i dont know atheists that believe in creationism .	0
as right of only one of two be be consider . when the need of the two be in conflict this be unavoidable .	0
so , um , pregnancy be solely a factor of a woman ' s behavior , eh ? no male involve ? of course it ' s solely a product of woman ' s behavior simone . it ' s the woman that have to make the phone call to the stork . the stork do not answer call from men .	1
you should really think about what you say before you say it . i have hear this before and its garbish , i have be around and own gun my whole life and i have never , not even once , have the thought of get a gun just because someone # # # # # # me off . i would never use a gun on a person unless that person be a viable threat to my life , such as come at me with a knife for example . you need to read what people say more thoroughly , and think about it before you respond . when he say `` can `` ( and there be not many simpler word than that ! ) it do not mean `` will `` , `` must `` , or `` shall `` be more aggressive . it have be show that in some case it `` can `` happen . it may not have happen with you . it still might , we do not know . we might even say that it be not likely to happen , but we can not say that it will not , because sometimes some people do behave more aggressively when they have a gun .	0
secondly , america must plead guilty in more recent such case among alliance force in afghanistan and iraq and among civilian in these country . they all fell victim of illegal american test of new type of nuclear weapon there ! the fact be stay hide from rest of the world . and where exactly do you hear this ? i find it hard to believe a governent that could not keep an affair or a low - level break - in under wrap could keep something like that secret . also if it be true and among alliance force why do you blame solely the us ?	0

should we allow health - care to the homeless , and illegal ? for the homeless : yes . however , i think that it should be base upon how they get to be homeless . because , sometimes , it ' s their fault . and in those time , i do not think that we should have to cover all of their health - care . do i believe that we should cover some of it ? yes , because it ' s the right thing to do , and it be what our nation claim . equal right . however , i have nothing to say on the issue of the illegal , because a member in my family be recently attack ( stab ) by one , and the wound be too fresh , and if i speak on it , i will be speak with prejudice , so i will leave that subject alone . but , what be your view ? i think we should not spend inordinate amount of resource on try to determine who be homeless and if it his own fault . anyway , whose business be it where someone live ?	0
what ' s the difference between human and chimp ? accord to the blowhard in the scientific world for the past 60 year , they say it be genetic mutation . but accord to these three article , include a september 2006 science article it ' s cook food and fire . you see these thing cause our gene to be express differently . . we think gene expression be a major part of what separate chimp and human , `` say kevin white , an associate professor of genetics , ecology and evolution at yale university in the united state . when we look at gene expression , we find fairly small change in 65 million year of macaque , orangutan and chimpanzee evolution , `` say dr yoav gilad of the university of chicago , lead author of the study . but he say it be follow by quick change in specific group of gene know as transcription factor , which control the expression of other gene , since human diverge from their ape ancestor during the last 5 million year . `` this rapid evolution in transcription factor occur only in human , `` gilad add in a statement . . the article be say that it be genetic change . change in gene encode certain transcription factor be what cause change in the expression of other gene .	0

whosoever shall be guilty of rape , polygamy , or sodomy with man or woman shall be punish , if a man , by castration , if a woman , by cut thro ' the cartilage of her nose a hole of one half inch diameter at the least . - thomas jefferson that ' s your man jefferson , whom you love to quote elsewhere . how do you like those apple ? so what ? jefferson be a prime example in opposite and double standard . he believe in freedom but own slave . write the declaration of independence yet only believe in freedom for white men not woman or people of color . this stance be very consistent with his double standard . he be also an adulterous , womanizer who have sex with his slave woman and produce child who would remain slave . so there again be his double standard he enslave his own child .	0

what if the answer to that be 0 ? you have beg the question . then you would have to be believe that out of the suppose million upon million of people who walk the earth none of them be pregnant and there be no newborn either . then again , to be christian , you also have to believe the world be create in 7 day and their be a biblical great flood too . the best part about write a fairytale be that the author get to make up everything as they go along .	1

when the party of opposition promotes lie and fearmongering , then deny those who attend townhall meeting an audience with their elect representative , and the opportunity to hear the actuality of the proposal , then that impinges on freedom of speech . the frenzied screaming shout claque prevent any meaningful discussion take place , to ensure that only their perverted message be hear . do you mean when pelosi say the protestors have nazi banner , when they be actually banner say ' no ' to nazism ? she ' s in the democrat . you mean the fantasy land whitehouse version of the proposal , that no one have actually read ? no one that understand the constitution would say that , that ' s a very ignorant comment . what ' s pervert be that you think freedom of speech mean the people have to shut up while they listen patiently to the government propaganda machine .	0

the thoughtful atheist , full of skepticism but fearful of the possibility of the existence of god and a day of judgement , may wish to consider the prayer of the skeptic , as follow : o lord - - if there be a lord , save my soul - - if i have a soul . i be nothing if not a thoughtful atheist , but it ' s not skepticism that drive me from religion , but revulsion , and i absolutely refuse to let fear , the low of emotion and religion favorite trump card , to have any sway over my life when it come to determine my religious belief . fear of judgement day be just one more trick religion have to get us to submit , and while i be not surprised it work to control illiterate savage and barbarian thousand of year past , i be astound so many people in this day an age allow themselves to fall prey to pascal wager .	0
you see , the thing be that not everybody agree with some of the theory that usually accompany evolution ( include big bang , abiogenesis , etc ) that try to answer the question `` how come existence `` . but i think that be the point . what if you do not agree with the germ theory of disease ? do that mean that it should not be teach in health class in our school ? should it be replace by the bad humor of night air theory ? but not everyone agree with that theory either .	0
it be no shock that if you have a religious moral code that reject a lifestyle then you would then reject that lifestyle . what be shock be that one would take the idea of reject a lifestyle and declare it `` homophobia `` or `` gay - bashing `` . it be a great example of take a fact and draw unreasonable conclusion from that . but no one would make such a crazy claim on these forum emoticonxrolleyes if the rejecting of the `` lifestyle `` result in death , beating , job displacement , eviction , insult or inequality , then what would you call it ? `` religious moral code ? ``	1
hehei can not tell a difference between my philosophy and science , it be all knowledge that be gain through non - contradictory inquiry into reality . and yet quantum physic tends to be very contradictory , at least to our perception . acausal event happen . a particle can be in two place at the same time . a particle can disappear and reappear in a different location without traverse that distance . and et cetera . since the beginning of our local universe occur at quantum level , i would be cautious about draw philosophical conclusion base on our macro - world experience .	0
since only abstinence be 100 % effective you be in effect suggest that unless you be prepared to raise a child , do not have sex . a return to control woman ' s sex live through negative social pressure be the objective of the pro - life movement , not save baby . if every pro - lifer be an adoptive parent i think they would have more credibility . why should every pro - lifer have to be an adoptive parent in order to have credibility ? this be akin to say that every pro - choicer should have to have an abortion - - or at least face that choice personally - - in order to be a credible pro - choicer .	0

on this 3 5 th anniversary of the roe v . wade decision , i would like to share my view on the issue of abortion . life begin at the point of conception . no one can deny that after a human be be conceive it will develop into the very same be as those debate this issue . what astounds me be that those who favor abortion go through an identical development stage as the be they be condemn to death . would these very same people agree that a similiar choice should have be make about their own existence ? abortion today be use primarily as a birth control of convenience because people be too self - center to take precaution . they prefer their own pleasurable self - indulgence over the care and sanctity of the life they create . what ever happen to take responsibility for one ' s action in this country ? be it too much to ask a woman who have conceive to place the child into adoption ? nine month of discomfort be nothing compare to life in prison for voluntary manslaughter ! do the father of the child have a say in this ? and what about the constitution of the united state ? be not all people conceive in this country deserving of life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness ? i believe abortion be a crime against humanity and should be outlaw . we need to overturn the roe v . wade decision and get back to cherish life in this country . for a country that murder it ' s child can not be far from self destruction . you have some good point here , but what do you do in the event of pregnancy due to rape ? or a pregnancy that be go to put the life of the mother at risk ? and to push the line a bit further , what about failed contraception , where the ' morning after ' pill be take ? do that count as abortion as it happen after conception ? smiley	0
and what of people who oppose homosexual relation or legalize gay marriage , or both , but who be not religious and therefore do not even use religion as an argument ? i argue against them with regard to whatever argument they muster . do we have any of those on this message board ? because from what i can see , it ' s primarily the `` religious `` argument counter . 	0

be you seriously claim all christian believe this ? even when i be a christian , i do not believe all that . virgin mary ? you get ta be kid me . even as a catholic , that do not make any sense . this creed strain credulity to the utmost , and i suspect you will find lot of christian who do not accept it literally . i can not vouch for what others believe . the creed be a pretty accurate summary of my belief as regard who and what god be . the apostle ' creed be the statement of belief use at baptism in most of christianity , so it would be strange for someone to have be baptise ( or confirm if they be baptise as an infant ) without believe this to be true . to be honest i be surprise by the idea that people ( outside the pseudo - christian sect like the mormon and jehovah ' s witness ) who claim to be christian would not believe what be state in the creed , it ' s not something that really occur to me . i know that some people misunderstand the use of the word catholic in the last paragraph but that ' s about it .	0

you be take that stance again ? arrest people for whatever excuse be convenient and simply let the court sort out the detail at a late date , require the accuse to pay large sum of money to prove their own innocence ? hardly a civilized approach to the law . assume people be guilty and treat them as such , until such time that they can prove that they be actually innocent , just be not the way to do thing . you be so fun . its amazing to hear you say this consider how much you applaud a law that pretty much allow this in arizona .	1
more concrete than the thought process which dismiss out of hand the flat statement of the us secretary of state opining that no function democracy should allow private ownership of gun , but allow them only to be lawfully hold by the state ? sleep well . no kidding . what could possibly be more concrete ? as far as i can tell , she have never publicly make a statement specifically about the dc gun ban but since , as you point out , she do say that no function democracy should allow private ownership of gun , i have trouble believing that she think the private citizen of dc should be allow to own gun , unless what she be say be that since we own gun , we should move toward a monarchy or perhapse some kind of dictatorship . she do not , as far as i know , voice her opinion regard private gun ownership in a totalitarian system .	0
what i be talk about be not a death penalty trial as we have today , but after the person have receive a 100 year or more sentence . the cost would be only the method of death . oh that greatly change the equation do not it ? very unrealistic , but for the sake of the debate , why not ? well , alledgedly , 23 innocent people have be put to death , and for sure two unrefutable case . i do not support kill people as a deterrent or as any mean in a justice system .	1
`` the sword of truth `` scoff ! why must truth be accompany with a tool of violence ? only the religious posse the shameless audacity of claim exclusive possession of truth and back their claim with violence . religion / christianity be negate by the very fact it be violent and indeed `` lunatic `` ! and once again ( s ) he ramble on while respond to nothing say in the prior post . at least you be consistent in your irrational hate speech . btw , the term sword of truth implies no violence against anyone at all . except in the mind of paranoid hate monger , that be . emoticonxgood	1

no , your idea about science be a philiosophy of science . sure , it ' s get a lot of believer , but historically it be not the only vision of science people have believe in . there be metaphysical evidence . the apostle saw jesus walk on water . there be no ' measure ' by your version of science , but what they saw remain true . people have entertain and will always continue to entertain belief in all manner of proposition . many people once believe that the earth be flat : perhaps some still do . but this have nothing to do with scientific truth . there be no `` version `` of science that one choose from a menu of possibility . by definition , scientific enquiry arrive at hypothesis after gather evidence from observation and experiment . any law , knowledge , etc . thatis arrive at by scientific method be open to modification or falsification if new evidence come to light that must be take into account . all science in this sense be provisional . the apostle may have believe that jesus walk on water : that do notmake it true .	0

“ either god exist or he do not . it be a scientific question . the existence of god be a scientific question , like any other . ” this be idiotic . science investigate material phenomenon , observable entity in the universe . no competent theologians or philosopher – not even the atheist one – have ever declare that god ( if he exist ) be an object in his own universe . perhaps there be no god , and intelligent christian readily admit that there may be some legitimate doubt . but if the judaeo - christian god exist , then he be the maker of the universe and not an entity within it . so you be claim the beardy bloke nail to a couple of bit of 2 x4 do not actually exist ? emoticonxrolleyes	1

yeah , i know . like many religion , people just claim they be one and then think they can just pick and choose what to follow . to me , you be all or nothing so those that think the pope be an idiot should probably consider a new faith because they do not believe in the one they say they do . so , you be say that you believe in absolutely everything your church believe and you support everything it do and the moment it do anything oustide of these you ' d leave right ?	0
most evolutionist believe that matter and time be create by a `` big bang . `` but recognition of the big bang as a very good explanation of cosmology be not limit to evolutionsits . in fact , most other scientist also believe so , most especially cosmologist and astrophysicist , who be directly concern with the early universe . evolutionist , even though the origin of matter and time be irrelevant to the study of evolution , be also educate in science and probably accept the work do by these other scientist .	0

this seem to be a mixture of pascal ' s wager and shock evidence of eternal cruelty and torture from the god of love . pray tell , arch , what be mean by ' the second death ' ? will you confirm or deny that symbolic fire mean eternal destruction , not eternal torment ? can you provide scripture that confirm that the ungodly will be torture for eternity in indestructible body ? why would a god of love torture people for eternity ? why would you want to worship such an evil creature if that be the case ? you mean pascal sucker bet ? if arch be wrong , he ' s waste a good portion of his life and income catering to a false priesthood , a tick suckling off the fat and meat and marrow of their ' flock ' . he ' s prevent himself from explore the wonderful opprotunities this limited life have to offer for the nebulous promise that come after death be assure . furthermore , he ' s extol others to do so also . because misery need company to justify itself and in insecurity over the rediculous belief they hold , they need number to validate their waste and servitude .	1

it ' s be a long stand standard that if the only motivation for a law , act , etc be religious , then it ' s a violation of socas . if a propose law just happen to agree with your religion , or if religion be just one small part of the motivation , then it ' s not a problem . but if you take out religion and you be leave with pretty much nothing , then you have get an issue . well . . . one could make that argument about anything - - voting for instance . amendment be create by voting , and people and legislature vote ( hopefully ) their conscience ( and the will of their constituent ) , even if they be religious . i think this be a different matter than , say , display religious icon on courtroom wall or ground , which be a clear endorsement of religion by the government . the 1 8 th amendment be religion - motivate , but it do not get rescind for that reason . it get rescind because it do not work practically .

secondly , i see you be fall into the usual o.p . of your ilk : when without an argument , attack the opponent on a simple spelling error ( especially when the one letter be right next to the one intend on the keyboard `` n `` be right next to `` b `` last time i check ) . really phyllis , get an actual argument instead of attack your opponent on spell error . no , that be not an argument . it be an illustration of a point . the point be this : that in order to stand in moral judgment of god , you would have to be of high moral character than god . in other word , you would have to be god in order to judge god . now , the point i make be that this be highly unlikely , as any be claiming to be god would not misspell word , no matter how closely the letter be on the keyboard . to be clear , i be not attack you ( at least i do not intend to ) by call out your spell mistake . i be try to illustrate a point . and the point be this : you be not perfect , and therefore , you be not god . and if you be not god , then you really can not stand in moral judgment of god .	0

it should be legalise as it ' s no more harmful than alcohol or tobacco . not only that but many marijuana user end up go onto harder drug through contact with their marijuana dealer . lesgalising it would break that link and actually reduce the level of drug addict overall . furthermore you could tax it and put the money into more police to clamp down on hard drug , which would be a good thing . ah i see . so we take away the right of someone to do with their own body what they want to , unless they pay the government more money ? sound a little too much like bribery to you too ? and how would clamp down on hard drug be a good thing ? how about we concentrate on the real crime in our society , and let people kill themselves / ruin their life if they want to . why should i be spend tax dollar ( ok , well hypothetically , pretend i pay tax ) to force someone else to not hurt themselves ? sound a little counter - productive ? and then we complain about a defecit ?

the child in the womb feel pain . when you put the needle up there to try to give the child anestesia in the womb , the child move away to not get stick by the needle . its because it feel pain . this be after 18 week . this be a child in the womb . the vast majority of abortion be perform within the first trimester . when they be perform in the second trimester it ' s a serious procedure for the mother to go through , and be something she obviously would not go into lightly . her reason for choose an abortion as late as that would have to far outweigh anything else , and she would need consent from two doctor to go ahead with it . basically what i be try to say be something like the foetus be develop enough to feel pain would not change the mind of a woman who have just find out she be pregnant and she ' d be rap , or be go through something you can not understand . for an abortion that late she ' d have to deliver the foetus anyway , which be traumatise enough .	0

since post be disappear anyway , let me add a new one . now we all know that i be make in the image and likeness of god and since god be perfect , that image and likeness must also be , as a logical consequence , perfect . to state less would mean that god be not perfect . so if i be the image and likeness of god , then either i be perfect or god be not . think of it as a photocopy of a check for a million dollar . yes the copy be in the image and likeness of the original check , but it be not the check . you can not cash the photocopy , regardless of how accurate the copy be , it be not the check , only an image of it . that do not mean anything be `` wrong `` with the original , and it doesnt mean that the copy have to have all the property and function of the original . its just an image	0

there do not have to be a defined `` shot call `` leadership of it any more than there have to be one in judeo christianity . the two be actually comparable - christianity get its leadership / organization through biblical reference and church leadership . evolution get its leadership / organization through the philosophical writing of everyone from herbert spencer to richard dawkins . and as i say , herbert spencer ' s idea predate darwin ' s . meanwhile , dawkins writing on religion be irrelevant to whether evolution be good biology .	0
in defense of the fruit fly , why would one evolve when one be already suit well to their environment ? what good do a 7 th leg do ? and about the experiment itself - please , always post reference . who do the experiment ? when ? under what condition ? how ? assume you be correct about the experiment , be variable put in place such as habitat change to reflect the timeline you speak of , a large variety of fruit fly to begin with , random mating , etc etc or do some people just shoot some x ray at a couple fruit fly , do some arithmetic which be probably wrong and call it that ? and im sorry , but there be mountain of direct evidence for evolution , you just need to go and look at it . i be totally surprised i have post so many post in this thread : not like me at all .	0

and without a gun you be defenseless , why can not you seem to understand that ? how many case have there be of a person have their personal firearm take right out of their hand by a criminal , never to be see again ? nobody ' s arm in england , but the criminal still go armed . what ' s your excuse for that ? hardly any criminal go arm in england , and certainly not with gun . burglar and mugger have enough sense to know that while get do for burglary or mugging will not be pleasant , get do for burglarly or mug and possession of a firearm will be far , far bad , assume they survive the arrival of the arm response squad .	0

hi s . cause trouble again ? happy the cat experiment you describe can not , unfortunately , be use to support lamarckian inheritance , because all the animal be deny the same essential nutrient , both the parent and the develop cat in the womb . logically , if lack of nourishment cause health problem in one generation it ' s inevitably go to cause the same problem in the next even without any evolution take place . as others have point out , this experiment be evidence that adaptation to that restrict diet be not happen . have the cat initially suffer and then begin to get well , this would be strong evidence that adaptation be occur . similarly , if you be deny vitamin c you would develop scurvy . if a pregnant woman be deny vitamin c - well , it hardly bear think about , but the fact the baby - be it to survive at all - would undoubtedly also suffer from scurvy be readily explicable by the observation that it , too , be deny vitamin c . now , if the baby be bear with a functional vitamin c synthesise gene , that would be compel evidence that organism could intelligently respond to environmental change . well i be not argue that this be adaptation . i have never say that . what i be say be the environment - - in this case diet be the cause for these trait to emerge in offspring . but like i say earlier toe do not admit that the diet or any enviornmental variable can influence trait in offspring . trait be dictate by gene and gene be close off from the enviornment . this be the basic dogma of weismann ' s barrier . i be not necessarily call this evolution . i be just simply point out that acquire trait can be inherit . there be no other way to describe this other than lamarckism . do you disagree that the inheritance of acquire characteristic be simply change in physiology acquire over the life of an organism that be transmit to offspring ?	0
guilty of the rape i be not dispute ( do not know anything about those case ) , but why do that automatically make him guilty of the rape and murder for which he be execute ? because he be find guilty of murder a minor rather than an adult . any crime commit by an adult against a child be more heinous in nature .	0

it have move on to the scientific theory of evolution . hmm , so give this exhibition of ignorance of what evolution be , you be say that because you never hear of mutation , evolution do not work ? that ' s a problem with your ignorance , not with the scientific theory of evolution . it change ratio of gene allele in a population . , which certainly fit the definition of evolution ( namely , `` the change in allele in a population over generational time ) . `` rm & ns `` ? but then , there also be absolutely no evidence for such an intelligence . false . quite . but then neither do many live system . unless you deliberately engage in revisionist linguistic hyperbole to change the definition of `` purposefully `` or `` intelligently , `` your argument be outright false . blatantly false . blatantly false . blatantly false . what be this ? some kind of `` i will will make a false presentation of living entity and use this falsehood to disprove evolution `` # # # # ? if your argument be base on outright falsehood like you just do , then the output will be false as well . remember the old computer programmer term - `` garbage in , garbage out . `` hey dane , you be real good at call people ignorant , sanctimoniously declare everything they say as false , blatantly false , or falsehood . but would it be too much to ask for you to back up your rejection of berts argument with anything more than insult ? like some actual fact for example ?	1
i disagree . well maybe technically . let us look at it this way . criminal ' access to gun may even go slightly up , because there be some criminal who may not want to obtain a handgun illegally . but the access of innocent citizen will go up way more than that of criminal , thus less criminal will want to commit a robbery or something with the fear of the person live there own a gun . criminal may forget get a gun anyway so maybe indirectly , but the major problem be access to gun , not ownership of gun . access will go up , no one dispute that , but people use them for self - defense go much high so that more than make up for the increase in access for criminal . make sense ? yes , but i think you miss my point . i state this above , remember the prohabition ? people actually drank more alchohal . without a ban , law abide citizen and criminal will have them , with a ban , there will be just criminal .	0
woopiee . i would have to say that you be put yourself deep and deeply into the ccoi every post you be make . you see , this be talk about ' biblical creation ' . you know , take genesis literally , and all that type of nonsense . there be many deeply religious christian that have no problem in accept that genesis be a story , and not historically accurate . it take someone profoundly stupid and ignorant to pull that stuff out of their rear . and like i say , ' undisputable ' be totally stupid . because even if the evidence be 100 percent positive , you have x that will dispute it . i mean , this link have undisputable evidence of horse evolution , yet you will dispute it anyway horse evolution over 55 million year we be not talk about genesis as a story be we ? we be talk about bilbical creation . you really be thick arent you ? i know there be religious people , deeply and otherwise who accept the story of genesis as a story but that have no relevance to the thread . undisputable be only stupid because you cant provide it . certainly not as comprehensively as the aristotlian view of the universe be disprove . the horse evolution thread be fine . you have show a little horse turn into a big horse and not one specie actually evolve into another distinct specie but i will give you the benefit of the doubt . now show exactly how life originate and you be home and dry .	0

i know you think i be act emotional with my post and it really be hard to tell whether someone be be emotional over a forum since it be so impersonal . what i can say be that post about the bible have become a mere formality to me and not the emotional debate it use to be . however , i believe it be necessary to eliminate the bible from debate of this sort by discredit it right away . then at least we can focus on real solution base on what be real instead of what some weirdo write thousand of year ago . what we have here be simply a perspective problem , which be the problem with most debate . i see the bible as sound , and every `` error `` in the bible i have research ( i have admittedly not research them all ) have be refute .	0

do you support the teaching of creationism alongside evolution in public school ? yes because it be the flipside to science and everyone deserve the right to choose in what they believe . how about other religious theory . what about teach about the sun god ? i do not mean that they believe that , but teach it as a choice because everyone deserve the right to choose in what they believe . actually let us also teach how the theory of gravity could be wrong and people can choose to believe that invisible fairys pull people down towards the earth and other massive object . we should teach the theory of gravity also but we need to give them the choice on what to believe .	1
why do not you try read what others post then slow down and think about what they say and who actually say it , . before you make a fool out of yourself and waste everyone ' s time and bandwidth ? the 12 trillion dollar debt that i post about ( not archie ) be to show we do not have the fund for national healthcare . we do not have the fund for medicare , medicaide or social security either . but , why be i even hopeful that you will take any of that into consideration . you do not seem to have the aptitude for it . so what be you propose ? death panel ? do you think we should euthanase the elderly or should we simply stop their social security payment and healthcare ?	1

' most of the time ' be not good enough . kill animal be murder member of other specie and those same gun can be use and be use for kill human . the same applies to gun use for target shooting . you can take them home , have them steal and then use to commit a crime ; or your son can take them to school and shoot a few dozen kid . well , i be not say a school massacre have ever take place in the usa or canada ; do not get me wrong oswald only use his gun for hunt , do not he ? do you think ban gun would stop people who want them from get them ? also you fail to address my point . be self - defense not a legitimate use for gun ?	0
both thompson and mcdonagh treat the child — the woman ' s own daughter or son - - like an invading stranger intent on do harm . they make the mother / child union into a host / predator relationship . a child be not an invader , though , a parasite living off his mother . a mother ' s womb be the baby ' s natural environment . eileen mcdonagh want us to believe that the child grow inside of a woman be trespass . one trespass when he ' s not in his rightful place , but a baby develop in the womb belong there . the argument that the baby be not a parasite , but be rather ' in its natural environment ' seem a false dichotomy : it be natural for a parasite to be in the enviroment of another ' s body , invade it . the relationship element will be deal with in the third section .	0
well say jito . i do not understand why pro - lifer dismiss pregnancy as easy and / or suggest that it ' s a wonderful snuggly thing that ' s just the best thing in the world . even if you want a baby , it ' s unbelievably hard to go through and something your body never fully recovers from . if you do not want a baby and be be force to go through it , it ' s unbearable . you can not force somebody to go through this life - threaten condition that be always physically harmful . ' life threaten condition that be always physically harmful `` ? what a giant load of steamy b . rarely be pregnancy physically harmful and even rare be it life threaten . there be over 6 billion people on this earth today . if motherhood be so damn dangerous , do not you think the population would be a lot low , even if it be just due to mother keel over after give birth ? where do you get this b from , plan parenthood ?	1

let me rephrase , what in the life of jesus do you have a problem with ? not a problem in the practice of the church or the people , but in the be that we believe in . which part do you have a problem with , or do you simply have a problem with the fact that be a `` religion `` . this be a very simple , easily answerable question . most people , especially in america , have problem with people tell them what to do . teenager hate be under the authority of adult . adult hate be under the authority of the government and enforcer of the law . everyone in the world be under worldly authority , but to actually have a god who create you , which give him the right to make commandment state what be good for you and what be not , that make most people really x off .	0

so every republican president for the last 30 year have be a rino . and every republican congressman ? the fact be that government have expand faster under republican administration than democratic one for almost 50 year now , easy . this show that , like so many other thing , you be completely ignorant of ron pauls position on iran . he do not advocate ' appease ' iran . see , like out found father , paul believe that if they dont threaten our national security , it have nothing to do with us and we should leave them alone . that cost us nothing . run around the world fight pre - emptive war that bankrupt us against opponent who pose no danger to us be not a viable long term strategy . consider the dumbocrats have hold the house ( which initiate spend bill ) for most of that time , then you have nothing but more hot air . oh yes he do . he will let them get the bomb , know they want to wipe out israel . not very bright of him . be he an anti - semite ?	0
i say yes so that feminist and other woman who think they be equal to men can see that they be actually not . i would also like to see them play football , tennis , athletics etc . against each other . then they will really shut the fuck up . tennis ? you be joke right ? it ' s already be prove that woman can take on a man anytime in that game ! others not so much but tennis most definately !	1
i mean a decision that the majority of the population have make in regard to legislation . i know what you mean . my comment be to demonstrate the counter side of the issue . interracial marriage law be overturn at a time when this country disapprove of interracial marriage by a margin of three to one . by your approach , interracial marriage law should not have be overturn in the 1960 ' s . in fact , by your approach we still would have have illegal interracial marriage into the late 80 ' s , early 90 ' s . the 1 4 th amendment make no proviso about allow unjust discrimination in case of majority rule . by your approach , what would be the point ? if the majority disapprove of the discrimination , they simply `` vote `` it out of existence . no need for the court at all .	0

i would like to point out that it be hardly a land slide . current admninistration be not as popular as either reagan or clinton be . this nation be divide . nothing be dead . george bush win the majority of vote ( the first majority winner in 16 year ) in an election with the high turnout in us history ( 1 1 7 million voter ) . the senate minority leader be defeat by a nobody . democrats lose at least 3 seat in each of the house and senate , something that never happen in a presidential election year . this give the republican majority in both branch of congress even more control . 11 liberal ballot initiative go down in flame by huge margin . if liberalism isn ' t dead , then it ' s in icu on a heart and lung machine . emoticonxrolleyes	0
[ brain size be relevant compare to the rest of the body - its the proportion that matter . if you be small then you can have a small brain , this contradict evolutionists ' position . they have long measure brain size and correlate it with intelligence . take homo erectus , for example . evolutionist have long say homo erectus be some sort of sub - human because of the size of his brain . it do not matter that turkana boy be short at about 5 ' 5 and 10 - 13 year old - - and that his head size do not look proportionally small - - today ' s scientist do not care about any of that . they just measure his skull . and compare that to an equivalent size human - if you compare the skill to a 10 - 13 year old boy , the erectus skeleton ' s cranial capacity would be significantly small . do not contradict in the slight other than the bizarre position you decide other people should hold .	0
the constitution do not allow state to do whatever they want for what they may call the general welfare . that be the point of the 1 4 th amendment . no , this be the point of the 1 0 th amendment . article 1 section 8 applies to congress . the 1 0 th amendment grant all power not list to the state or people . the 1 4 th amendment be not the `` federal government can do whatever `` amendment .	1
the liberal left be not mainstream , trebor . just check the last election on that one . the religious reigh be not mainstream either . and frankly , you be also confuse politics and religion . you do know that there be a difference ? you also know there be a differnece between hateful proclimations and scholarship , do not you ? 	1

i would say no . i mean if you can believe in god , the you must believe that he ' s go to put what he mean in the bible . `` he form us from the dust of the earth . `` why would not he put something else , like we evolve . do not argue that they would not be able to comprehend that kind of science back then because you be limit the ability of god . i believe the question be `` who ? `` i be christian and i believe in evolution . whether it contradict the old testament or not make no difference to me . jesus contradict the old testament . the bible be the inspired word of god , not a dictation to scribe . men write the allegory describe the creation of thing . say that mankind take a long time to understand certain thing be not limit the power of god . he could have choose to make early man einsteinian , but he do not . he could have choose for mankind to bypass the flat - earth concept , but he do not . he could have choose for all human to be highly intelligent , but he do not . what he do be to leave us alone and let us figure thing out on our own , include how long it take to get where we be now .	0
there be nothing inherently irrational about the theory of evolution be use to explain life in the physical universe , yet creation begin with an irrational premise , that we can `` know `` about the `` unknowable `` . be this a rational statement ? if so , prove it rationally , by science .	1
think twice about that . you come on here strut your stuff that plan parenthood be lie or misleading and now everyone can see that you be the one who be mislead . now be not that ironic ! you be the only one defend them now . the funny part it , plan parenthood have the stats as reason why abortion should be legal ( or be legal ) . but wait ! as we establish the number of people that die from abortion go down to under a thousand so this reason be still not accurate and be still mislead . anymore idea ?	0
ah , thats where youre mistaken . any aspect of science that can be discredit help strengthen the creationist stance . not really . that ' s the fallacy of exclusion of the middle . because there be only two choice , if one be wrong somehow , the other be therefore correct . the problem be that there be not only two choice for sure . besides , science be wrong all the time , it do not prove that creation be right . in fact , for instance , science estaimtes of moon dust have be prove wildly wrong , and those correction actually harm creation .	0
um , in the debate description it talk about how marx predict that laissez faire capitalism would lead to an the nation be rule by an elite few , which would cause the work majority to revolt . i merely show how socialism with private property be fascism and capitalism with regulation be fascism . be i say it ' s bad ? no , that ' s for you decide . if you like fascism , good for you . alright , i think i see your point know . however , i think the only way in which conservative would be socialist be that they be soo capitalist they end up effectively swing back to the other end of the spectrum by make people want to kill them . which be a silly argument because the proletariat ain ' t never rise up and not settle for simple tax break or what have you . furthermore , i be intrigue by your fascism point , i be just wonder how it affect the debate . be you say that essentially all political ideal can effectively be reduce to the same ideology at their base level ?	0
but what ' s real truth ? the real truth be evolutionist can not even get that right . the real truth be that member of the same specie almost always work together for the benefit of the population . almost ? usually , that be true , and it involve selection between population . however , there be often time when some of a population be well able to survive . those time , selection occurs within a population .	0

thanks for finally admit it . and far more , thanks for post evidence of the gay community bigotry and intolerance against christianity . all these people be do be pass out tract after pay the request entrance fee . do not you dare ever accuse my community of be intolerant or bigoted until your community rise above it . he scream and insulted and throw his literature at the vice president of pride . and you once again snipet and reword my post by take them out of context to serve your own irrational and bigoted thought process . oh and dont accuse your community ? what be you some holy leader ? get off of your self rightous high horse and get a clue ! and how be my community rise above your ' community ' bigotry and and slander ? by have pride movement like these and stand up for ourselves .	1
. no , but all arrange marriage be , tada ! arrange . _ . why be this think thing so hard for you ? if there happen to be an arranged marriage where everyone live happily ever after , awsome ! but people should have a choice who they spend the rest of their life with . you just have a knee - jerk reaction to defend anything of your culture past or present . you do not see me make similar knee - jerk reaction . you do not see me make similar knee - jerk reaction . woopdee fuck doo . but people should have a choice who they spend the rest of their life with . well do darling . but be an american you should know that in marriage people choose who they spend the next couple of year with not the rest of their life . now let us get back to the fact - where in an arranged marriage do it say the 2 people get arrange do not have a choice ?	1
evolution be suppose to be science , and be say to not address religion . and the scientific paper do not . the problem here be that creationists do not read the scientific paper . in fact , most can not even understand them .	1

i have get no problem with it . geez , your not normal if you do not have it circumcise . some woman will not want you ( sexually ) because of it . baby do not remember the pain . and its not just for religious purpose , come on , the main reason be for hygienics . you could get an infection or something at an old age and have to get that do at 15 - 16 or so on . how painful would it be to get it then . i be happy i be circumcise , and i be glad my parent do it . so you be happy that they chop of the most sensitive part of your penis ? that someone take and cut out a part of your body without your consent ? what if it where your nipple ? after all nipple on men serve no purpose .	1
i would like to see more conclusive data on the subject but most importantly a real plausible solution . i be not an expert but it do appear most scientist feel global warming be partly man - make . i do get a little sketch out when i see scientist be try to restrict research for those that go against the theory . they may have strong argument but that kinda bs really blow your credibility . i see , when you say `` i be not an expert `` do you mean you be not a climate scientist or do you mean you do not have the scientific knowledge to discuss this ?	0
4 ) if / when you have men commander be they treat with respect by both the men and woman under them ? see above . i can not help but notice your signature . what be you , patriot under a different username ? bad show , patriot . sock puppet be not good debate form . patriot - - about your statement that you have be vindicate . i hope you be just fool around . happy truthseeker ' s first post do not even belong in a debate forum . she state an opinion , and then state absolutely nothing to back it up in any way . no evidence . no reason . not one `` because `` . nothing . it be like enter a presidential candidate debate and say , `` i think the other guy suck `` and leave . hence why i ask her as politely as possible to elaborate .	0
maybe they do it on purpose ? they push through the amendment to quiet the rr while the issue be a hot botton topic , but make sure it ' s unconstitutional so that it ' ll get shoot down . just a thought . they do it on purpose , alright . but not because it ' ll be shoot down - - in at least one state , the supreme court decide that similar legislation do not address more than one issue . the reason they put them together be that , in most state , a ban on civil union would fail .	0
again , what be this ' social support ' you think the govt . provide , exactly ? be specific please . simple question . no , the constitutional amendment do not address a cultural context . it would keep you from get the federal benefit - - the legal context . marriage be social support . the government , in support marriage , be give social support to certain relationship cover by marriage . you argue marriage should be leave up to the culture institution such as church , government should only do the paper work . that ' s an acknowledgment of the current social role of government recognize marriage . you do not want government to provide that social support , suddenly , now that it will include gay . oh yes , it speak to the cultural relevence of government - recognize marriage . people would not feel sufficiently compel to change the constitution over a matter of meaningless government paperwork which have no social relevence .	0
they be different term and apply to different thing . secularism be not a worldview in itself , it be a policy of how to apply religious and other worldview in real life . secularism do not exclude people with a religious worldview . one may imagine a devout christian that firmly believe in his faith , but be also convince that faith must come from within and that force someone to behave in accordance with a religion simply encourage false faith , and would logically conclude that his faith should not be force upon people ( usually with the subclause of `` let them burn in hell afterwards `` , or something else along those line ) . so if an atheist believe that human be the high form of intelligence , and a devout christian believe god be the high form of intelligence , the christian should allow the atheist to force him to behave as if human be the high form of intelligence ?	0
an alternative ( short ! ) wording of the statement , take into account the great context of the constitution , would be `` a ( human ) zygote be a person `` . as hint by the title , the general context of this thread be how the statement relate to the right of a zygote ; we may end up branch out into that area , but the statement be the start point . please note that i add the word `` human `` to your comment above iangb . after all it be not my claim that all zygote be human being / `` person . `` agree ? also , i want to make it clear that i be argue only for the most basic of human right ( life ) and not for the full panopoly of right that say an adult human individual would have .	0
evolutionist have construct the geologic column in order to illustrate the supposed progression of `` primitive `` life form to `` more complex `` system we observe today . yet , since only a small percentage of the earth ' s surface obeys even a portion of the geologic column , the claim of their have take place to form a period of rock - - life - - time over the earth be therefore fantastic and imaginative thinking . this do not mean that the column be fantastic nor imaginative . it may very well be that not all area of the earth accumulate all type of rock that form the column ; this do not mean that the year at which similar column be deposit in different place in the world be not similar . and of course , even if the geologic column be not true , this provide no evidence of creationism .	0
first of all , i can turn around right here , because i can see that you already have no idea what you be talk about . pro - choicers do not advocate the abortion of fetus . anti - choice antic be get pretty dirty these day . but they do support the choice to abort a fetus or embryo . an argument make for slavery be that `` you do not have to own them but do not tell us what to do `` . a fairly similar argument but do not show whether or not abortion be wrong just that some line of thinking should be question .	0

on point , do you disagree that it should be the navy ' s role to make the sea lanes safe for merchant shipping ? yes i disagree with that point . the navy , just like the police , can not possibly be everywhere that danger might raise its ugly head . merchant ship can not afford a 24 / 7 navy escort anymore than the average citizen can afford to hire body guard 24 / 7 . there ' s no legitimate reason why merchant ship should be unarmed and unable to address danger that deliberately come after them .	0

who ' s to say that anyone bush might appoint would not strike down a constitutional amendment that ban gay marriage ? the justice be not to be the puppet of the legislature or the president . do not forget richard nixon ' s appointment of harry blackmun . because the judge president bush nominates be strict constructionist . they interpret the law not make it . that be the bad nightmare for a liberal or a gay who depend on judge to over rule the vote of the people . they can not win at the ballot box so they think they can win in the court . it will not happen . get use to it . 	0

why be it ok for your side to determine what be right for society but when i offer my vote / opinion , i be impose something evil on you ? let me explain this to you . you want to stop abortion for someone else . you want to take a woman right to choose away . where as jito support a woman right to choose do not impose upon your life in any way . you want to stop me from be able to marry this do not effect your life in any way yet have a devastationg effect on my life . the left support right while your side want to limit the right of others . you want to stop me from be able to marry because you have a religious belief against it even though i may have a religious belief that support it . therefore you be impose your religious and moral view on me when i do not share those belief .	0

rubbish , there be many that argue otherwise . the life of twin can be view as start at the moment the zygote / embryo split for example . the reality though be there be no single point at which a human life begin : the moment the egg and sperm form , the moment of conception , first division and implantation , the moment the heart start to beat , the moment of birth etc all mark stage in the formation of a new life . oh yeahrubbish rubbish , scientifically speak , human life ( use a most bsic term ) begin at conception . the twin exist as two seperate entity the moment each contain the individual human dna . seem to me you good be certain when it begin before you go around end it . if you be drive at night an you `` think `` you might see a person ahead in the middle of the road you be hopefully not gon na drive over that person . instead that uncertainty should lead you to stop . if you dont like that example , consider a hunter who be unsure what be in the bush .	0

well it all depend on who be go to determine `` right `` , be not it ? abortion be not math . there be no finite answer . just a myriad of opinion which inevitable lead to either abortion be right or abortion be wrong . no different now then when roe v wade become law or any other time in history . i do like aristotle ' s take ; he teach that a fetus originally have a vegetable soul but he do not say what kind of vegetable . i do not understand why people be stick in this mindset that we have to define all abortion as either right or wrong . in between , there be the option of call abortion under certain circumstance as right or wrong or call abortion in certain trimester as right or wrong . why limit yourself to the extreme view ? i do not believe that the original post ask for an absolute answer , just a survey of opinion . after all , as you say , abortion be not math and there be no one answer that everyone might agree with . however , the question of people ' s opinion on the beginning of personhood and how it relate to the morality of abortion lie at the very core of the debate on abortion right . really . what other question be more relevant ?	0

just think i ' d share about secular right for gay . not `` special right `` but equal right . no , homosexual do not have the same right as heterosexual do . we can not serve in the military because of our sexual orientation . we do not all have protection against be fire because of our sexual orientation . as for the secular right , i do not think this be right . from a religious standpoint , i have never see more ignorance , hatred or twisted lie put into word as i have on this board from some of the folk who be christian . personally , i do not see the difference between what be `` good `` and what be `` evil `` when it come to religion on here . i have see satanist say nice thing than what have be write here . if this be your idea of what be good , i want no part of it . as far as the two , secular right and religious right , it seem that although the constitution have a freedom of religion clause in it , faith base people can not and will not separate the two out make the separation clause invalid . what ' s the point in that ? i think they be do it out of fear . they see the moral decline in america and they have latch onto the glbt community as their scapegoat . since it ' s no longer pc to attack african - american for their obvious difference , it ' s not pc to go after other religion ( especially judaism - not that it actually stop pure hate group from do it ) they have decide that attack a group of people which be sexually different should be the way to go . i mean , their religion tell them that premarital sex be bad and wrong . even though there be a multi - billion dollar industry base around heterosexual sex , they actually depend on that money too much to bite the hand that feed them . insted , they attack a group that have not legal right to marriage let alone little legal standing as far as individual right . it ' s easy that way .	0

the more we seek to redefine marriage , and chip away at god ' s original design for the home , the more we put our family and our nation at risk . how do you know what god ' s original design for the home be ? how do you know that god do not create homosexual for a reason ( i . e . help raise child of people who can not care for them ) ? how be allow 2 people who commit to love eachother for life put heterosexual family and the nation at risk ? at risk from what ? this debate about gay marriage be really just the late outgrowth of a culture that for decade have be drift from biblical standard of truth and morality . the sexual revolution , for example , seek to bring legitimacy to sex outside of marriage . the woman ' s liberation movement work to revolutionize the role of men and woman in marriage and in our society . throw in a rise emphasis on materialism and personal happiness , and you end up with a dramatically new way of look at marriage . when million of american view marriage from the mindset of “ what ' s in it for me ? ” concept like responsibility , self - sacrifice , and lifelong commitment become secondary . be it any wonder that our divorce rate be so high ? or that the number of child bear outside of marriage continue to rise ? or that an increase number of couple be opt to live together instead of marry ? and now the push for gay marriage seek to redefine marriage even far . from the moment god create marriage , it be design with a man and woman in mind . god design two sex male and female — he do not create four sex . homosexual marriage can not fulfill god ' s purpose for marriage . i realize we be not all christian here . however , this issue of gay marriage transends all of society and it will have a negative effect on all of us . jmho . i disagree . i have be in a loving , commit relationship for 25 year to the same person exclusively . how do this have a negative affect on you ?	0

the question be about whale . pay attention will you ? you be right ; i do not type anything in at all . i just ask huntard to prove his claim . but in response to your propaganda piece , here ' s some oppose evidence . the third problem , ' as zimmer acknowledges ' , be that there aren ’ t very many early whale fossil . do that surprise you ? evolutionist have probably lead you to believe that the fossil evidence for whale evolution be , pardon the expression , rock - solid . but there isn ’ t really that much ' hard ' evidence . whale evolution be mostly imaginary , or speculative at best . since whale be mammal , evolutionist imagine that a land - go mammal must have return to the sea . at first , they imagine this without any fossil evidence . so , they go look for fossil to support their preconceive idea . the first hint that they be probably right come in 1983 , when researcher phil gingerich find a 52 - million year old skull in shallow deposit in pakistan . although fragmentary , the skull have teeth that be nearly identical with those of mesonychids and the archaeocetes . … despite the whale - like characteristic of the skull , however , pakicetus lack two important adaptation which be present in modern whale . in living whale , the ear contain large sinus that can be fill with blood , allow the animal to maintain pressure while dive . modern whale also transmit sound vibration to the inner ear use a ' fat pad ' , which allow them to hear directionally underwater . pakicetus lack both of these feature , indicate that it be unable to dive deeply and that it could not hear well underwater . these anatomical clue mesh well with its habitat , since the pakicetus bone be find in deposit that have be lay down at the mouth of a river on the shore of a shallow sea , where the opportunity for deep diving would be limit . although no post - cranial bone of pakicetus be find , it seem logical to assume , from the teeth and ear structure , that the animal spent a great deal of time in shallow water look for food , but return to the land to rest , somewhat like a modern sea lion . … the early known cetacean , pakicetus , demonstrate a mixture of trait which be unique to the terrestrial mesonychids as well as marine whale , and indicate that the cetacean be descend from the mesonychid carnivore . although we have not find any post - cranial bone from pakicetus yet , . 5 consider what this evolutionist have just tell us . first , they haven ’ t find any post - cranial bone of pakicetus . [ since this essay be write , they have find some post - cranial bone . ] post - cranial bone be bone below the skull . so , all they have find be a skull . they don ’ t have a single pakicetus rib . they don ’ t have any pakicetus vertebra . no other bone of any kind . just a skull - - and a fragmentary one at that . why do they think it come from a whale ancestor ? because its teeth look like whale teeth . but when they look at the ear bone , there be nothing to indicate that it could hear underwater . the skull be find in association with other fossil that live on the bank of a river or along the sea shore . yet it “ demonstrate a mixture of trait which be unique to the terrestrial mesonychids as well as marine whale , and indicate that the cetacean [ whale ] be descend from the mesonychid carnivore . ” in a whale of trouble so the claim be make base only on the teeth because no other evidence support such a conclusion . that ' s real complete and reliable information that justify make such an absolute claim from . not ! emoticonxdonno only some ? what ' s this then : hxxp : // en . wikipedia . org / wiki / image : pakicetus_ ( 1 ) . jpg replace the xx with tt in case you be wonder why i put the link up like that , it ' s the stupid post count thingy .	1

you have fall into the same trap as the iders . when we say `` design `` there be an unspoken prepositional phrase - - `` by an intelligent entity `` . what be really mean by `` design `` - - in both paley and iders - - be that plant and animal be manufacture . just like the watch be manufacture . but not all `` design `` be manufacture . take the repetitive ridge of sand on a beach . they be create by the motion of the water . shall i remind you of the humorous story about the `` image of jesus `` that attract much attention , yet turn out to be a coincidence of shadow ? this be why i insist upon your define the term you be use .	0
of those that be beneficial , the chance of actually be pass on be minimal consider the animal bearing that mutation have to actually be the big strongest animal to pass on its gene - unless it be lucky . no it do not . that ' s why darwin object to the use of that phrase in reference to his theory . those who do not bother to learn the theory tend to misunderstand . fittness be not a reference to big and strong . it make it too easy to misrepresent evolutionary theory . i will state it again since you seem to have miss or ignore it the first time . natural selection be differential reproductive success . those organisms that be well adapt to their environment tend to survive to reproduce in great number , and therefore they tend to leave more offspring , than those organism that be less well adapt . you have get to be a pretty shallow thinker to equate an environmental advantage with big and strong .	0
it ' s not as though our vocal opponent of climatological science have exactly be enlighten . we have yet to hear why they think the scientific consensus be wrong . we ' d have define consensus first . if it be 50 % + 1 then there probably be one . then after that , who be say they be wrong ? prejudice as its fine . lesz like to stereotype people to an extreme that can never be change . i have never tell lesz my view on global warming and lesz have show no interest in gather fact about what others believe .	1
um . have you read leveticus ? and i mean , read it . not skim it . because , god love everybody . be you reach ? semantics . god have mandate against homosexuality . my point be , people be prepared to admit that the creation story , and the story of noahs arc be metaphor . they read them , and then look at the evidence to hand and say `` well , it can not be really true the way it be write , so it must mean this . `` but the bias of the church against homosexuality be base of a small passage of text which , it seem , can not be interpret away . that part that condemn homosexuality be accurate , straight - from - god - mouth truth . again , why the dichotomy ? why be some part of the bible open to interpretation , but others be rigid ?	0
as the founder of darwinism / evolution introduce it as a way to make god unnecessary / get around god . you of course have documentation of darwin lay out his plan as to how to weasel evolution into classroom to oust theism , right ? no ? you be make it all up ? shocking .	1

well let us look at the fact themselves . conceal carry law be now part of the legal system in 48 out of the 50 state in this country . conceal carry start in florida and work their way from one state to another over a continuous 20 year period , and not once have a conceal carry law ever be repeal , for any reason . gun control law , like handgun rationing , mandatory reporting standard , ammunition registry , secondary background check , trigger lock and storage requirement , etc . be limit in their reach , stick to only certain state . there ' s be no mass adoption of these law by various state across the country , and there ' s even be case of them be repeal due to ineffectiveness . if gun control law work at control crime , and the presence of firearm actually have the potential to increase crime rate , these fact would be reverse . and the brady background check have not be repeal either so by your `` logic `` it must be effective .	1
you could probably start by not call the majority of people anti - moral , anti - family , anti - equality , anti - american , homophobes . but thats just me emoticonxrolleyes the truth hurt do not it ? they be anti my moral , anti my family , anti my equality , anti my america , and defintely homophobic and i would add one more bigot .	1
i do not say it be make me hungry . i ask if i say that , would that sound gay . again , it be a joke . uhg . __ _ __ __ . you seem to be lose in our joke , you have to tell people you be joke so they know . and you get the punctuation wrong , in the russian phrase . the only way for it not to sound insane in russian , would be to put it as : ' ___ _ __ . __ ' . call someone ' __ ' , mean thing be serious , and you be ready for a fight . if you claim it to be a joke , you be just insane . so i assume that you get the punctuation wrong , and it be your signature .	0
yep i do say that and you do not know why ? if you can repeal the bor , any one of them there be nothing to stop you from repeal the article either be there ? in fact , you have make that claim repeatedly . i find it funny you think article v be repeal yet the bill of right reference article v for passage . so we have the bill of right which can not be repeal but article v which be repeal mean all the amendment we have be unconstitutional ? you have really lose it have not you .	1
apparently , these `` underlying preference `` be of absolutely no effect , since the psychological conditioning of the individual override any other `` build - in `` trait factor . therefore these `` built - in `` trait factor be useless in practicality , because nothing about the individual ' s identity be influence by them . so why should we even entertain the idea that they exist ? i guess i be just `` psychologically condition `` to be blue eye ? . 	1

. here be what be hard to understand about that ; in matthew , 12:30 , jesus say `` he who be not with me be against me , and he who do not gather with me scatter `` . but miller be with jesus ( and by extension , you ) : he say that god exists and that christianity be true . or , if you insist that he ' s against you , you be leave with this conundrum : you call miller and theistic evolutionist incorrect , and he call you and anti - evolutionist incorrect ; why be your position any more logical than his ? regard your citation about atheist use evolutionary finding to support their concept , you omit the remainder of the paragraph . shame on you , marc , for your quote mine . miller clearly continue with `` philosophical pronouncement `` that many atheist do not forward . over the following three paragraph , he examine a single philosophical insinuation - - not a plethora of them - - and then move beyond `` atheistic philosophical pronouncement . ``	0

evolution be not need to explain such an event , as natural selection clearly account for it . evolution do not explain the event . the event be an example of evolution - a change in the frequency of allele in a populatioin over time . the explanation may or may not be evolution by natural selection . you merely assert that base on your imagined case .	0
theory and law be completely different . i think this paragraph should answer your question thoroughly . true until proven otherwise eh ? xcaliber and you must get along great . you have thing backward and you be probably be confuse by the ' experiment to falsify a theory ' , that be a tenet of science base on the generalization that untrue theory be easily disprove . no logician ( and by extension no good scientist ) would ever hold a lack of disproof as proof . oh right theory be never proven , so in fact your definition of theory would go something like this - ' an idea that be not disprove which we assume be true ' .	1
then explain to me why a pregnant woman be hit by a car not long ago lead to the death of both mother and baby . result in a double vehicular homicide charge be level against the driver ? how can that be if the unborn child do not have right as a human be ? and why could the mother have abort that baby legally if she choose to ? be not that a true catch 22 for the unborn , and a contradiction in the law ? because that the law one have to presume and of course the law apply to that specific case . as to it be contradictory - well the law be load with contradiction if you look at all closely . on the other hand consider that the driver kill the woman and obviously damage her fetus beyond recovery - without the consent of the woman . in other word the death of the fetus be not by consent of the person who hold the right to decide but rather by the negligence or intent of the guilty party . and yes prior to her death ( assumming all other requirement be meet ) she could have at her choice and un - coerce have choose to abort the fetus without incur a legal penalty . but that would of course be much different .	0

1 . i think a lot of woman take take the easy way out when it come to and abortion for the reason i have state over and over again . 2 . what i say be it seem you can not pick up the newspaper these day and not see a case of where some woman have abandon a new born baby in a trash can or dumpster . it never use to be that way . so you argue that for some woman , abortion be the ' easy way out ' , and that those woman choose to abort , take the easy way out as you say , for arbitrary reason ? could you please reiterate these reason here ( preferably in an enumerated list ) and explain why they should be consider arbitrary ? indeed . but we have establish that suppose a high profile in the medium in no way entail an actual increase in incident . so i will repeat the question , hearsay aside , upon what evidence do you base the assertion that more woman be abandon infant ?	0

i , personally , believe in the theory that since many thing in nature make no sense without god , he create the universe . pandion have already point out that this be not a theory , it ' s a mode of wishful thinking . more damagingly , however , if you examine it for more than a moment it do not even fulfill the role you give it . you say ' many thing in nature make no sense without god ' , but how do god ' s origin and nature make sense ? where do he / she / it spring from ? all you do by invoke god as an ' explanation ' be push the problem one step far back . the god hypothesis may look like an explanation , but it be not .	0
it have to do with freedom and equality but then again i do not expect non empathic people to understand that . look at you answer below i would have though you would understand the concept that i get to choose who i share my life with , who i transfer my property too and who i call family . you do not understand that the government say to everyone who be a family by the issuance of that piece of legal paper . the in equality part come in when i be tell that i can not have that piece of paper but some hetero can because someone else have a religious belief that should have no effect on my life what so ever . i be say that if so religious x want to force their religion on me by use that religion as an excuse for the state not issue me that piece of paper then i want a say in their life and want the government to remove that belief . if the religious x stay out of my life then i will stay out of theirs but if they want to get involve in my life then i want to get involve in theirs . eye for an eye equality by its very definition . you want the government out of your life and i want religion out of my government and my life . pathetic , why would you let anyone besides yourself determine who you call family ? nobody be force their religion on you . nobody be even say who you can or can not get marry to . what be be say be that you , or anyone else , do not have the `` right `` to have that marriage recognize by gov ' t . universal recognition by gov ' t do not even happen in hetro marriage . nowhere in the founding document of this nation do it say `` all gov ' t entity shall recognize all people ' s marriage `` . since we have `` a government for the people by the people `` , the duty of government not spell out in the founding document be determine by the people . you have the freedom to vote your belief and so do everybody else .	1

( from the science point of view ) all human be trace to monkey from africa . from there they spread throughout the world . if it be not evolution , then why do human from high elevation have large lung ? how come african have a darker skin tone ? how come human from cold region have a thicker coat of hair ? i doubt it be coinsidental , and no offense , but i dont think that a god do this for us . every person have a subconscience . in this subconscience we think of less fact . do that mean that it be possible for the subconscience to create the genetic material use for reproduction a way to survive good ? i believe so .	0

what do you see as the major flaw of the view opposite of your in regard to how abortion should be deal with ? like i say in another thread , the argument i hear most often from so - call ' pro - choicers ' be that you can not legislate morality . well then what can you legislate ? every law in existence be legislation of morality ! by that way of thinking , then we should have no law . if someone kidnaps and murder your 3 - year - old child , then let us hope the murderer go free because we can not legislate morality !	1
the vast majority of proclamation and assumption illustrate a cultural gap between science and christianity , such as this post , be over emphasized and exaggerate as they focus on people who be expect to be out of touch ( ie . people educate in the 40 ' s and 50 ' s when high education be less common ) or a very small percentage of christian . christian include in mass people of all academic background who find their paradigm consistent with their viewable ( and non - observable ) reality and by alienate them in mass by focus on the minority of christian you perpetuate falsehood . actually , the more educate a person be , the less likely he be to be a creationist . creationists tend to be semi - literate ( poorly educate ) , rural , poor , and female .	0

i be not exactly sure your point with this article . be it merely to show that pro - choice group exaggerate claim ? that they use emotional rhetoric to sway people to their side ? trust me , you have tell me nothing new . in fact , i be somewhat amused that you point this out , give that pro - life group be guilty of all this and more . it say : although the thought of find a deceased young woman with a bloody coat hanger dangle between her leg be - - to say the least - - unpleasant , powerful and emotionally charge rhetoric do not a good argument make . i almost pee myself laugh when i read this . whatever powerful , emotional image you believe pro - choice be guilty of , pro - life group be many time bad . what be the mental image of a deceased young woman compare to the physical picture of bloody aborted fetus ' ? i have see pro - life group hold huge poster outside high - school , and pro - life group hold them up in front of clinic . how much do you want to bet that the fellow here would defend one while attack the other ? the article speaks of fallacy yet fail to mention the statement of ' abortion be wrong because it ' s murder ! ' that pro - life people seem very fond of . this be the exact fallacy the article mention , use an unproven point ( abortion be murder ) to hold up an unproven point ( abortion be wrong ) . i point this out not to absolve pro - choice group of guilt , but to say : before point finger , make sure your own house be in order . this entire article be also something of a strawman argument as well . the argument that illegal abortion will almost inevitably occur if abortion be ban be not a justification for legal abortion ( per se ) . as i see it , since illegal abortion will almost inevitably occur if abortion be ban , the complaint be that pro - life people would rather see more woman hurt ( and yes , more woman be hurt with illegal abortion than legal ) than actually solve the problem with society . to ban abortion and declare the problem solve be extremely irresponsible and do nothing to help society or woman . if you would , chloe , please link to the study the article mention about the number of illegal abortion ? i ’ m amaze they manage to eek out number , give that not even the cdc have exact figure since illegal abortion be not track . the most compelling evidence i ’ ve see look at the birth rate for various ethnic group the year previous to abortion be legal to the year after , correct for various factor such as good birth control method . they find little change in the birth rate , indicate the number of abortion most likely do not increase or decrease . yes , i know pro - choice group mislead with stats and figure . this be nothing new , but i feel it be dishonest to point this out without acknowledge your own group shortcoming in the same area . well sigma , which be more painful ? be burn with salene for 30 minute to an hour and if that doesnt work after the 3 rd time , be bear prematurally and lay on a table and starve to death . or a woman stick a clothes hanger up and accidentally kill herself but intentionally kill the kid within her ? seem to me that people dont really care about how the baby feel . it have just as much feeling as the mother .	0

do you define weight as numerical or some kind of rating system on who be the most important church father . what part of darwinian evolution do the church not agree with ? that link also have the following quote . should modern science be able to prove without the shadow of a doubt that man evolve from amoeba , reptile , animal life into what he be today , orthodox theology would be able to make the transitional acceptance far more readily than western theology for all the reason state above . if genesis in the bible be not a literal account of creation ( i , e . , six day , man from dust , fruit of good and evil ) then what be its use ? why include as the foundation of the entire bible a story that be either totally fabricate , or mostly inaccurate / metaphorical ? genesis 1 & 2 , in the literal application , have 2 vitally important concept that the entire bible be totally useless without : 1 . god be sovereign and totally limitless in power 2 . man have disobey god and be in need of reconciliation everything else in the entire bible rest on these 2 premise . now if genesis have it wrong , then what be the use of any of the rest of the bible ? from all scientific perspective , genesis 1 & 2 never happen , and here the validity of the entire bible be question .	0

you can ignore the statement by d.j . futuyma and identical one make by gould , mayr , dawkins , dobzhansky and others but not without depart from mainstream evolutionary biology . the vast majority of scientist do not believe in creationism , and all those people you list who say there be only 2 varients evolution or creationism - - they be ' t anthropological or theological expert . all they know be their westernized view . their opinion have no reflection on biology in that sense . they should stick to biology . there be only 1 true way - - that ' s evolution . the other ' s be wishful thinking , whether they be the primordial flood , the divine parrot , or magic god who make people from dust .	1

but what be apparent externally be not what be important . what be important be , if i teleport you , would you still experience the world through that new body . if the answer be yes , the question be beg of just how identical do the new you have to be to the old one in order for you to experience the world in it . there be no reason to think that if we leave a finger off of the new you , it would not be you , because if i cut off your finger right now you would still be trebor . we get to the point where we could make you a completely different person , but still allow that this new body be yours . in addition , if two of you be create , you experience the world through two body , which also be not possible . i do not want or not want to call this ' frame of refference ' thing anything i be just try to work out what you consider it be . tell me what it be . tell me what it ' s capability be . if it be abstract in nature what be it ' s actual worth as a concept . whatever that be . this something ? you be not your body as i have show but because your body generate your mind it , that which affect the body can effect the mind which i can only imagine be part of this ' frame of refference ' thing . or , in reality , ' i ' , ' you ' and ' me ' be an illusion and do not actually exist .	1

i do not think the point be to come up with an exact number of gun law . the point be to show that the 20,000 figure often claim by the pro - gun side be very doubtful . but the total number of gun law may not tell us a whole lot . 100 city could pass law to require wait period . that would count as 100 gun law . or the federal government could pass one law to require a waiting period throughout the nation . it would count as one law but would have more of an effect than 100 separate city law . and your point be demonstrate to be specious use your own source . to contain strawman even as you claim it to be a strawman .	0

any novel change / mutation in `` expression `` at the organismic level that can not be directly link to a novel genetic mutation can only be eam , aka devo - evo , ( that be , developmental evolution ) , a neo - lamarkian phenomenon . why ? because such a phenomenon nothing whatsoever to do with the darwinist , `` toe `` , that be , that such novel trait change / ' expression ' originate from - - `` random genetic mutation `` , coincidentally express as some lucky organismic trait that `` natural selection `` do not eliminate before it be inherit by offspring . and there simply be no genetic mutation here . what it do show , empirically , be that organismic tyraits be not determine by genetic chemical , but by the organism ' s usage of those chemical to its own purpose and advantage . i will stop quote here . do not want people to have too big a read . actually toe be not all that random . to a certain degree yes . but sexual selection aka a part of the toe . dictate that when there be a benificial / attractive change . that change will be enhance almost exponentially . because the female of the specie will be program to search for that and will carry the gene herself so will give it to her off spring . and the male will be more succesfull so produce more off spring . so no instant eye or anything like that . i think that ' s what you be imply . sorry for respond in kronus ' s stead . i be sure he can defend himself but i find it unjust the way you reply to his post and attack it on foundation that you do not have .	0
i be have difficulty here . maybe a list of what be teach as science now that would be disqualify would simplify thing ? as have be say , astrophysics would be out ? to be honest . i do not know . but i do know that to argue something be false because the consequence be not desire be a logical fallacy ( appeal to consequence ) . so be the argument i post earlier ( post below for quick reference ) true or false ? and if false , why ? a ) only science should be teach in science class ( this be why creationism should not be teach in science class ) . b ) science be a collection of testable theory which have be thoroughly observe , identify , describe , experimentally investigate and remain unrefuted . conclusion : if a be true and b be valid then science class should only consist of testable theory which have be thoroughly observe , identify , describe , experimentally investigate and remain unrefuted .	0

i think they be do it out of fear . they see the moral decline in america and they have latch onto the glbt community as their scapegoat . since it ' s no longer pc to attack african - american for their obvious difference , it ' s not pc to go after other religion ( especially judaism - not that it actually stop pure hate group from do it ) they have decide that attack a group of people which be sexually different should be the way to go . i mean , their religion tell them that premarital sex be bad and wrong . even though there be a multi - billion dollar industry base around heterosexual sex , they actually depend on that money too much to bite the hand that feed them . insted , they attack a group that have not legal right to marriage let alone little legal standing as far as individual right . it ' s easy that way . i can see what you be say . it ' s pretty much true . be a jewish homosexual , i know it first hand . but just for once , could not they pick on somebody else ? it seem almost like a bully tactic for the christian heterosexual who be against same sex marriage to pick on someone who do not have a legal leg to stand on . that ' s sad .	0

archie , this post be like dejavu for me chloe . yesterday my pastor say the same exact thing in church , and for the same reason . and so he should , if so he believe . i would like to ask your pastor how many child ( s ) he have adopt . only then be ( s ) he qualify to speak , however . just do not any of you try to shove that perverted view of `` life `` on any of the woman in my family , thank you . emoticonxangry they be perfectly capable of decide the future of their pregnancy for themselves without any of you butt in where you do not belong . interesting , this be the same type of angry rant that capo use to post on the abortion debate before he be ban . how interesting that you should get so angry and work up over such an innocent exchange between me and chloe .	1

i support legalization of every drug . i be sure most of you be young and have be feed x like `` marijuana will kill you . `` actually it do less damage to the brain then alcohol and it can not kill you . it be impossible . it take 20,000 joint in one sit to overdose on marijuana . alcohol however kill thousand of american each year from alcohol poisoning . you know that idiot pothead . he do not get dumb from pot , he get dumb from birth . marijuana do not have long term effect on iq . the only side effect be the lazy side effect . the day after a person tend to be more lazy however it be like a hang over . it only last for a day . there be no reason why it should remain illegal . i also support all drug be legalize because the drug war have fail . we spend billion each year on the drug war and i can call someone right now and pick up some crack . it be a failure . what we should do be make it government control and then spend the money to fight drug on drug education . flood the school with actual info about how herion kill and how it break a person down . tell the kid how you can die from one use of coke . tell them the short term and long term effect of each drug . if we can educate our kid and even adult through an ad campaign about what drug do to you then we could save far more people . also allow drug to be regulate will lower the price and effectively kill drug dealer and gang off the street . there be so many benefit to legalize drug . anyone want to fight it ? i have proof to back up what i say and also have the effect of each drug . you be an idiot who have obviously never work ina first responder category . if you think that increase the volume and social acceptance of drug use to the same level of alcohol will ' solve ' anything , then you be just an idiot . you have obviously never see whart drug abuse do to family and people ' s life . you be right , alcohol be bad , and the main reason its worse be because of 2 reason , volume and availability ala social acceptance . legalize all drug would have catastrophic social impact . do not fee me that line about tax it and use the money for rehab . we have tax the x out of tobacco and alcohol the last 100 year and the last time i check alcoholism and lung cancer have not be erradicated .	0

of course men can , do , and should have opinion and feeling about abortion , but to say that your interest be equal to that as a woman be silly . men will never be pregnant , regardless of what law stand , they impact men very little in any real way . pure conjecture on your part . as a father of three , i have as much vested interest in my kid as my wife have . to suggest otherwise be bs . but , maybe you do not understand that because you have not walk a mile in a father ' s shoe . emoticonxrolleyes	1

but one idea that make me hesistate to be pro - choice be an analogy . imagine a hunter who see something move behind a bush . it could be a deer , it could be a human , or it could be something else . the hunter lack the information to know for sure what be behind the bush . what be the ethical policy for a hunter in this situation ? it seem clear to me : if you be not sure it ' s not human , do not kill it . so if it ' s not human , we can kill it ? but i dare say that ' s a different topic completely . sorry , that be more along animal right than abortion . abortion be this for me : if the baby be go to endanger the mother ' s life as well as the baby , why endanger the baby and the mother ? stick on the decided path , would you rather kill something you know be human , or something that you be not sure be human . it sound a bit cruel and i do not intend it to be that way at all . it ' s just that one loss would hard enough , why make it two ?	1

more stupidity . neither your site nor vor substance free post prove that 99 % of abortion be ' murder .

a bump of the topic . it seem that any evolutionist with any knowledge of this topic have either quit this board or be ban . yet there be no response by creationists . why be that ? be it that garioch be correct ? be it that creationists be make assertion without understand what they be talk about ? if creationists be talk from a position of knowledge then there should be a creationist discussion of gastralia , their relative position to the sternum , the ossification of the sternum , the presence of a carina , and so forth . the continued failure of creationists to respond with intelligent discussion demonstrate their ignorance of the topic . therefore , any creationist assertion of the status of archaeopteryx must be consider as unfounded . one should not assume ignorance on the part of creationists . that be a mistake that too many evolutionist make . in the real world , we have people willing to say thing they already know be not true . why should creationists be any different ? after all , they be people , too . but rather than accept that fact , evolutionists argue that creationists be ignorant of a subject when , in reality , they ( creationists ) be simply tell lie .	0

the concept of a gay family make me a little uncomforatable , but i can not formulate any logical arguements to support marrige segregation . by default , i be a supporter of gay adoption . any two loving people can bring up a family just fine . as for marrige , it begin as a religious institution , but have be ingrain into american society as a cutural union . gay people deserve the right to recognition in front of the world as a couple , as a partnership . spicygirl be more uncomforatable with gay couple than i will ever be , and that will never change . i would bet money she have not figure out her sexuality just yet . that aside , there be no logical argument to deny gay right . if you have one , i would love to hear it . i be back ! have to re - visit the real world . anyway , how be it that you say i be confuse about my sexuality , because i do not approve of gay marriage ? ! that be weak ! people always claim thing like that when they have nothing else to say . i be straight as hell , and you really do not know me engough to say diffrently . but you on the other hand must be confuse .	1

we saw this in the recent supreme court decision . they choose to focus a lot on the role handgun could play in defend house and home against criminal , but seem to have no problem with a ban on machine gun - the kind of gun that would logically seem to be most protect by the second amendment because of their usefulness in military conflict which would make them a well deterrent against tyranny than other type of firearm . thus , the supreme court choose to `` strain at a gnat and swallow a camel `` to use a biblical idiom in their treatment of the second amendment . now you be play word game to confuse people . page 11 of the heller ruling state that the definition of `` arm `` include all modern form of bearable arm that ' re in common use . they do not rule on machineguns because they be not part of the case .	0

yeah , there be those who scream that self - defence be not a valid reason for gun ownership . there be no valid reason until the libs think them up , but i will set that aside for now . the question here be wether or not you think hunt be a valid reason for gun ownership . i do not forsee any stats post , as this thread have nothing to do with crime . so this be a chance for you to work on debate skill . i think the only valid reason for own a gun be because you want to . every person ( with some exception ) have the right to keep and bear arm , why you do it be your own business . give specific reason for gun ownership be the top of a slippery slope towards ban certain firearm . while i have specific reason for own specific gun , to include hunting , i own some of my gun for no other reason than they be fun to shoot . a humorus side note : i own one gun strictly for fishing , sound odd but its common practice ( at least in alaska ) to shoot large halibut before bring them aboard .	0

how about the ability to marry multiple partner ? or do you think that nothing be capable of undermine the institution of marriage ? those culture that permit multiple wife at least do have issue as a result , but hard to say they fail miserably . we be complex animal and not all animal mate for life . there be significantly more involved in the lifelong union of human than reproduction . multi - marry under the right circumstance work , but it be not for everybody and even for those that it be for do not mean it ' s for them always . in a nutshell marriage be the big commitment any person will make and should be give the consideration and think it deserve . same sex marriage can cause a perfect union of two people the same as m / f and can make a mockery or marriage just as many m / f union currently do . the emotional investment be the same , the responsibility and obligation be the same , the only difference be genitalia and a little more hair in some case .	0

so by your various definition , leave - handedness make that person a deviant . most of america be right hand ( so it would be consider the norm ) , leave - hand people function different than right hand people as well as behave differently in the way the go about their life . be leave handed people wrong and unnatural as well ? no one have determine why people be leave - hand , and whether it be cause by genetics or early environmental stimulus . they be deviate from the norm . do you know that the word sinister be derive from the old english meaning ' leave hand ' due to old belief about left - handedness ? do you actually ( by your previous argument ) believe that leave - handedness be wrong ? if you do not , then you can not possibly apply your argument to homosexuality . if you do , i be sorry , but you be ignorant . you mus think you be pretty smart huh ? well guess what ? you be confuse common , most common , majority , and norm . lefthandedness be considerd common and the norm . you be use a superstistion from 300 year ago to qualify left handedness as deviant . good try though . also leave hand be genetic . it ' s not a gene but it ' s genetically relate to the person ' s physical characteristic .	1

the problem then be , how could the universe begin in the midst of absolutely nothing ( no time , no matter , no space , no energy ) ? what could possibly trigger the universe ' s beginning ?

umm . thats the point of say god of the gap - when science fill in the gap then there be less for your god to do . this be just pure intentional ignorance - you do realise peddlar , that thing can happen over time ? not to mention that evolutionary hypothesis have be make and then test - protein homology for one , there be no way anyone know the answer before hand but what be observe later when technology improve be what be expect . dna date pretty much give the same time for common ancestor as fossil do . there be really no difference between carry out an experiment a fraction of a second in the past and observe it than million of year - other than the latter make it a little difficult to get all the evidence sometime . science be the current sum of human knowledge about how the world work . never get publish thoughthere be a massive amount of evidence that point to thing be design via evolution rather than a concious designer - there be massive amount of badly design organ and organism , either god be spiteful or incompetant . let not go into the parasitic wasp and hyperparasitic wasp which be what make darwin convert ( or part of it ) . he could not beleive that a kind benevolent creator would design such horror intentionally . have something ' s larvae consume your organ whilst still alive and feeding of another catapilar ' s gut whilst still inside them strike you as a kind and good thing to do ? mayabe this be a miniscule amount of suffer compare to what await you on the flipside . weather it be an eternity of bliss or agony and suffering . who really know . mayabe those who have this happen to them have it come to them ?	0
consider an extreme literalist , ask to put the two genesis account side by side and then ask , `` accord to the two account , on what day be man create ? `` everyone not a literalist can see that the two account conflict when read literally . but i have know literalists say , `` i see no contradiction `` - and they mean it . because their axiom be that the bible be infallible , so any problem with read it be the reader ' s fault , whereas yours be that contradiction implies error . what ken ' s say be that we can not draw a distinction between your axiom and those of a bible literalist in term of which be ' right ' , because axiom be state not prove : axiom define what be ' right ' . to reiterate : his error be in forget that the universe operate accord to its own axiom , whatever they may be , and we can judge whether or not our axiom be congruent .	0

his reference to marxism be to say that nazi germany wasn ' t communist in that it do not promote public ownership of the mean of production as the ussr and china do at the time . be you completely unaware of the difference between communism and socialism ? do not the socialist country around the world today allow private ownership of business ? while at the same time , right now , be not we see our own government promote increased regulation in oversee the control of these corporation , just as hitler do in germany ? statism be just another word for , and synonym for the definition of socialism . here be what statism / socialism have do today to the world economy . archie , the only way you can possibly come to that conclusion be by literally ignore everything the author say , every accepted definition of the word socialism , statism , capitalism , fascism and nazism . if we ignore everything the author say and make up our own definition for those word , it still do not work because the argument be still illogical and you look like a dishonest fool make it . face it . you get pwned . be you really not bright enough to recognize that ?	1

so , you do not judge ! then it ' s okay to lump all christian together ! evidently , that make it all good ! so much for be a free - thinker . but then again , you never address the issue i ask you about slavery . you claim to be moral , base on democratic ideal of moarlity . but democracy would have very likely continue slavery in the usa ! it be christian who aim high . i be sorry if you want to talk past that , and say i disgust you . uh , i just say that i do judge ! so what in the hell be you talk about ? you be not well . i do not bother to adress your point about slavery because there ' s no point . i disagree with your claim as i suspect would most historian . but it do not surprise me that christian would try to claim that they end slavery since they also try to falsely claim they found the country .	1

the reason the dems wimp out be because the gun nut vote be likely to be sway by a candidate ' s position on gun control , whereas non gun nut , while have an opinion , be most likely concern about other issue . it be the same reason people do not tend to come out loudly pro - choice , even though the majority of the us population be pro - choice . well say . most american favor more gun control , but unfortunately this majority of american tend not to vote base on the issue of gun control while a very vocal minority compose of gun activist definitely do vote base on the issue . this be something politician have realize since 1994 so they have be more hesitant to support gun control . there probably will be more gun control supporter in office in the coming year but i be not sure how much this will change thing .	0
science be different . in science it ' s a matter of who have the most convincing evidence . if we be to give christianity the benefit of the doubt and allow it to throw its own evidence into the list of candidate , can you honestly tell me that creationsim be the best answer ? if so ( and i extend the challenge i make to lappster ) educate and enlighten us . i be eager ( as always ) to read the evidence for myself . i have post response to demon38 ' s earlier post . i have offer dna finding as evidence to begin with . it be not my evidence , but scientific evidence . that be the only evidence that i will provide in this discussion . i think there be ample evidence to cause scientist to rethink their theory , evidence that they do not want to accept because it put certain hypothesis they have advance in a poor light .	0
i do not think there be many , who consider the fetus a person in the way you be imply , that be still for abortion `` right `` . the debate be not if its ok to kill a human be because obviously your not go to get a huge debate on that but rather be the fetus a human be . whether a fetus be a person be not something open to consideration . an apple be not an orange . the reason that we have two word to apply as label be simply because they absolutely be not the same thing . it be that simple . suppose that a fetus be frozen and implant in a female 22 year later . be it of legal drinking age at birth ? obviously not . we currently have the technology to actually do this .	0
this be silly . you say you be use the article as justification for the question and then you want to call us dishonest when you do not even cite the article or the newspaper it come from ? there be two word that come to mind describe this situtation : mendacious be one . hacktacular be another . probably because the article be irrelevant . either way , i post an article to make you happy so quit compaining and just answer the question with some respect . thanks for just simply answer dog . i be not sure why it be so complicate . if you do not ask race than how can you be prejudice ? there be also no proof that people would currently be discriminate against . but current affirmative action be a topic for another thread .	0

how be it not , there be one define moment in life : the fertilization , after that there be nothing be finger snap and its a baby . it be a human . do you realize , that the fetus have only recently not be define as a human be . back when birth control first come out , plan parenthood want to make sure it would be leagle . so they redefine ' life ' to say that you have to draw breth . by the way have you ever see any picture of the aborted baby ?

fundamental rightsthis relationship of citizen and state be fundamental to democracy . in the word of the u.s. declaration of independence , write by thomas jefferson in 1776 : we hold these truth to be self - evident , that all men be create equal , that they be endow by their creator with certain inalienable right , that among these be life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . that to secure these right , government be institute among men , derive their just power from the consent of the govern . more specifically , in democracy , these fundamental or inalienable right include freedom of speech and expression , freedom of religion and conscience , freedom of assembly , and the right to equal protection before the law . this be by no mean an exhaustive list of the right that citizens enjoy in a democracy , but it do constitute a set of the irreducible core right that any democratic government worthy of the name must uphold . since they exist independently of government , in jefferson ' s view , these right can not be legislate away , nor should they be subject to the whim of an electoral majority . and here our government recognize : rule of law : fundamental right of citizen democracy exist to serve their people	0

i can not claim originality for this proof , but i have never hear any good refutation of it . that ' s because its sophistry . its an inherent contradiction and it simply mean we do not have the capacity to understand it . another more common example be that the assertion that the universe can not be endless , and yet as far as we know it be . try to understand it be for us human like an ant try to fathom the theory of relativity . damn be we ever conceited as a race . we seem to think that if we can not understand something , it can not be . we also tend to think , in every generation , that we have achieve somehow the pinnacle of progress .	0
then i guess you have not be pay much attention in our last few conversation . when it come to your view on homosexuality and homophobia , there be no `` of course `` . if you want people to think that you find a stance homophobic , then you need to actually come out and say so . if i want `` people `` to think ? kronos , the only one here who ' s make a big issue of whether or not i state the obvious here be you . you be the one make a big deal of it here . in a case where it ' s blatantly obvious , as in this one , then obviously there ' s an issue of homophobia here .	0

no it be not . darwinists say that evolution happens by way of selection of random variant . what i be ask for be for science to make sure the variant do not arise nonrandomly . i be look for experiment on animal that rule out heritable , adaptive variation . again , nonrandom be not the same as lamarckian . phenotypic variation can be nonrandom because the organism can select the most attractive / successful mate with whom to breed . once again , you be totally stick on one aspect of the toe , random mutation ; the toe be much more than that .	0

sure . the woman be a person , and individual , sentient human be . she have the same right to control her bodily resource as any other person do . as such , you can no more force her , against her will , to provide bodily resource to an embryo or fetus , than you can yourself be force to give of your bodily resource against your will . forgive me if this seem picky , but i just want to try and fully understand this argument . i should say that i do not necessarily agree with it , and would like to respond as to why . i just want to give a proper representation of your argument so that i can make a sound response . as such , you can no more force her , against her will , to provide bodily resource to an embryo or fetus , than you can yourself be force to give of your bodily resource against your will . where do this right originate from , i . e . , be it from the us constitution via the 1 4 th amendment etc ?	0

and if gay marriage be legalize , what ' s to stop people from use the same argument to legalize marry animal ? or themselves ? all they would need to say be `` come on , everyone think gay marriage would lead to the downfall of man , but it have not , and neither will legalize [ insert marriage concept here ] `` your argument be evidence of the gradual process you purport not to exist . i still have not see an adequate rebuttal to this . why can not people marry themselves if they be in love with themselves ? i must have miss your response .	1
the thing be , though , that if marriage be privatize people can have freedom without `` redefine the standard . `` it be a way for us to allow all those oddball marriage without put an `` official stamp of approval `` on them . liberal want to expand the government involvement in marriage to include gay marriage , thus put society ' s approval on these thing ( something that get moralists very angry . ) conservatives want to continue the statist reward for straight marriage only - a violation of the 1 4 th amendment . libertarian combine the best of both position . their position ( privatization ) create the freedom to marry , upholds the constitution , and avoids official approval of gay marriage at the same time . i think your idea have merit . however , before i would fully endorse it , i be interested in how you see it be implement and administer from the standpoint of equal protection under the law .	0
citizen would need to have machine gun , bazooka , shoulder launch missile , tank , blackhawk helicopter , i agree , for the most part . once you get to tank and helicopter though ? too big , too easy a target for a tyrannical regime . do you see the iraqi and afghani use tank and helicopter ? i be sure they could get them if they really want , but they be useless against a government that invest in satellite technology and bomber . good to stick with the rocket launcher and mine .	0

people who own weapon be not responsible for combat or prevent crime in general . gun ownership do not commit us to become default cop . what ownership do be allow us to protect ourselves in the event of an arm criminal attack . so the basis for your article thesis be fallacious in expect armed people to somehow become extension of law enforcement in order to justify be arm . therefore , the only rational response to your premise be to encourage more law abide people to be arm and train so as to outnumber the armed criminal so they will have no unarmed citizen to victimize . that be the most effective way to intimidate the lawless criminal into never use their weapon for violence for fear that their intend victim may actually be good arm then they be . good observation ! he be very good at present fellatious viewpoint and lack of knowledge and content . he be one of the more fellatious people i know and you will not find him take notice of the constitution as the supreme law of the land either .	1
5 ) show me one instance of an evolutionist ( any book , any website ) admit that “ evolution ” may not be evolution at all , but simply an individual organism ' s ability to utilize his genetic diversity and adapt himself to his local environment – that selection may not have anything to do with phenotypic change . and instead of vertically , evolution first happen horizontally . ( a trait of a good scientist be to consider oppose viewpoint and alternative , not to ignore them . ) apart from the ' horizontally instead of vertically ' part which i do not understand - we be a hundred or so year too late , unfortunately . you might as well ask for an example of a book or website on cosmology that ' admits ' the sun may just be a big ball of fire push by a scarab beetle , and not a nuclear furnace about which the earth orbit . there come a point where continue to seriously ' consider ' a viewpoint become a waste of time and resource , because sufficient testing have be do and evidence recover to discount it . we may one day encounter evidence that completely overturn the whole applecart , but so far it have not happen .	0

yes through what be describe as the heterosexual lifestyle . besides you be very much an exception to the rule . p.s . only homosexual wear dungaree , and i be heterosexual . now you be just be an butt . the word dungarees be a coloquialism . do you know what that word mean ? also that ' s what jean be call before the word `` jean ' enter the venacular .

to apathy : call me crazy , but i still do not see any evolution in the peppered moth ! we have light and dark moth before the industrial revolution , we now still have light and dark moth . the only thing that have change be the population ratio , assumably by * natural selection * . natural selection be not proof of evolution by any mean . creationists recognise it and accept it as it go in nicely with the creationary model . natural selection be basically the death of a particular type of animal if they be unsuited to the environment . in a give environment ( e . g . a very cold region ) , some ( e . g . the long - haired dog ) will be more likely to survive , and so pass on their information , than others . natural selection can favour some set of information above others , and can eliminate some of the exist information in the population , but it can not create any new information . an example , consider the cold environment mention above . we take a population of both long , short and medium , haired dog to this environment . over time , very short time , the population will only consist of the long haired dog as the short and medium haired dog would freeze and be wipe out by the cold condition . so , as a result , the population as a whole have lose the information for make short haired dog and have not gain any new information . what do we have when we first take the dog to the environment ? dog ( vary in hair size ) . what do we get after a short amount of time ? dog ( only the long hair size ) . there be no evolution occur here , we have dog before , dog after . the only difference be that the gene for make short hair have be eradicate from the population by natural selection - - that be it . this be the essense of natural selection - and go in nicely with the biblical account of our origin , i . e . variation within a kind and that kind ' s have the ability to only lose information - not gain it . so even if the peppered moth case be really true , and not a fraud , it still would not be evidence for evolution as oppose to creation . anyone who say other wise , do not really know what they be talk about unless new genetic information be somehow be add to the moth ' s total dna content , i . e . their genome , in which case you might have a point . would any creationists like to challenge anything about this article or the concept ? his method appear to be good , i . e . use observation and experimental data , as well as repeatability . he be use the scientific method ( in reverse as he be collect the observation and experimental data and then will draw a conclusion base on the evidence and possibly his own bias . this be yet to be determine , however . can you keep us inform of his progress ? also another example put forward be a bacteria that can only sustain itself by eat nylon . the theory go - nylon be a recent invention therefore this bacteria must have eolved recently . what it suggest however be that a portion of an exist population would have die if not for nylon . the bug have to have nylon , or it will die . it be akin to look at a portion of the human population who would die from heart - trouble . but thankfully we have now get artificial heart , therefore this portion can survive . they be not a new specie of human , but live only because of a recent invention .	0
they use to keel over regularly before modern medicine and my wife have be on medication for a thyroid condition ever since she deliver . `` during the seventeenth and eighteenth century , between 1 percent and 1.5 percent of all birth end in the mother ' s death as a result of exhaustion , dehydration , infection , hemorrhage , or convulsion . since the typical mother give birth to between five and eight child , her lifetime chance of die in childbirth ran as high as 1 in 8 . this meant that if a woman have eight female friend , it be likely that one might die in childbirth . `` and be this the 1 7 th century , i might understand that , but this be the 2 1 st century . we do not `` bleed `` people to make them well ; we do not have barber perform surgery and we usually have a trained physician in the delivery room .	0

that ' s information to you , not to the organism . if someone say the mountain will not get high on it ' s own , and you go and dump dirt on it ; you have not disproven them . by information they mean that record anything useful for the organism , include specific function . now the average anti - evolutionist would like it to be just specific function in which case you could just say novelty ( information on how to create new system ) . dna record useful data ( information ) for other thing , it record modification of exist system to adapt to the environment . deletion of detrimental code be also information , although the net change be a loss . as for my previous argument , they have be that there be no known law , physic , or calculation that would cause the construction of an novel system ; leave only probability . that ' s one of the dumb thing i have ever hear . if these dummy do not have a problem with information increase , but do have a problem with beneficial information increase , do not you think there be a problem ? you include . you do not have a problem with change , only good change bug you . dumb !	1

if your personal identity cause you to believe that an attack on those idea be an attack on you personally , than obviously what i have be say about your personal commitent and emotional involvement with materialist / mechanist / darwinist / atheism be spot on the money . if i be to become upset merely because you tell me the idea be wrong , you might have a point . but i do not ; never have , so far as i recall . an idea can not be stupid , or simple - mind . an idea can be right or wrong , or perhaps partly both . when you describe an idea as stupid , you be say it be wrong and one would have to be stupid to think that . when you describe an idea as simple minded you be say it be wrong and one would have to be simple - mind to think that .	0
for me the reason i do not `` give it credit `` be that it ' s irrelevant - - i do not see how it matter either way way if sexual `` orientation `` be natural or not . it ' s a separate issue from the moral one . remember , it ' s natural for animal to do many thing - - some specie ' male impregnate the female and leave forever the female to raise the offsrping on it ' s own . but just because such behavior exists among animal do not make it moral in human . in fact i ' d call it immoral . there be many such example in the animal kingdom . natural do not mean it ' s automatically moral . then you would want me to be something god do not create me to be ? silly , i ' d say ! human be part of the animal kingdom . mammal if i remember from biology . be you not an animal ? if not , maybe the mothership will come and pick you up soon .	1

in the following example that you provide : what be the context of the word ' truncate ' ? the way i read it - it be talk about a truncated string of code or something . what be truncate ? the gene and therefore the enzyme it produce . lpl be the designation for a gene that encode lipoprotein lipase , an enzyme that hydrolyze lipid in lipoprotein . the actual gene encode a protein of 475 amino acid that become a mature protein of 448 amino acid after cleavage of a signal peptide . one study be able to identify 3 common snp ( single nucleotide polymorphism ) in the coding region of the gene , 2 of which result in small change in enzyme function in european population . the third snp convert that locus to a stop codon and result in an enzyme that be 447 amino acid long . thus , the enzyme have be truncate . the result enzyme , lpl s447x , be functional . in fact , it result in low incidence of vascular disease and low blood pressure . other truncation result in non - functional enzyme .	0

it appear to me , that if slavery have be put up to a vote in texas back before the civil war , and texan vote to add an amendment to their state constitution legalize slavery of black ( which they would have ) , you could as simply say `` maybe , just maybe , the reason that many american people think slavery of black be right be simply because it be . `` well , the slavery analogy for gay right be past it ' s applicability at this point - - one be a property issue ( also root in deep prejudice ) , the other be a morality issue . many people oppose gay marriage out of morality and not prejudice . the same can not be say for slavery . there be many way that the analogy do not work and that ' s just one of them . in fact , it could as easily be an analogy to reverse it and say that the one who do the enslaving be analogous to gay right lobbyist and the abolitionist be analogous to those who seek to protect marriage . after all , the plantation owner be the one really fight for ill - conceive right - - right that they should not have have .	0

why be it moot ? do pregnant woman who be choose adoption suddenly do not have themselves and dependent to care for . if i be pregnant and say pregnancy would prevent me from provide for myself or my son i would end it . the question be why some woman choose abortion over adoption . one reason be because the pregnancy be a threat to be able to provide for oneself . and your definition of selfish disgust me . whoosh . go back to the part in which we be discuss a specific case and stop try to encompass the universe in your justification . ( you know there be mother in bokoboko that do not have enough lizard egg to fee their baby so they eat them ) emoticonxbanghead i be not surprise that a moral definition of selfish disgust you . splat ! happy 	1

so , in one thread you be whine because he pay a low tax rate than his secretary , but in this thread you be gloat because the legislation he suggest to fix that get shoot down ? you be a strange , strange man . wrong again daewoo ; but at least you be painfully consistent . i be merely point out the hypocrisy and level of ignorance obama display every time he open his economically clueless and divisive mouth . but then , who would ever accuse you of get anything right ? once again , the buffet rule be for the gullible and clueless to glom onto in a vacuum of reality and the fact that it would do nothing to solve this nation problem and be merely a diversion from the massive failure this president have be , more so than even carter . i cant say i be surprise you would glom onto such an idiot talk point . it be only strange for someone who be so completely clueless that they can not even comprehend a simple thread premise . so be you bear this clueless , or deliberately play the role of someone who be patently clueless ?	1
actually , the more common usage would be ce . and bce ( common era , and before common era ) regardless of the name change , the calendar be still key on the birth and death of christ . and that will be so at least until the atheist be able to come up with another numbering system and force it on everyone else just to pacify their own baby mentality .	0

yup , dismiss spirituality selfishly , one can conveniently substitute religion like `` legal - ism `` . so , a human - mother be equal to the ability / wisdom of god now ? - interesting thing : how many mother do you know , who can successfully champion a person ( hide in coma - state of mind ) ? annie hmm , a mere human - mother can not make decision concern her own body , but you , sk8joyful , can usurp the position of god and tell another human , especially a mere human - mother , what she be allow to do with her body .	1
yes , i certainly do consider these risk , and the risk at the time be far high for continue pregnancy than get an abortion . then for you , you make the right decision at the time . i ' d personally have be leary of not get to work or go to school easily from the doctor statement , especially in regard to keep the child .	0
they would say that you be not a real christian as well . that all it take be to believe , or accept christ into their life in order to be `` save `` . and since they be the majority that would make you and your kind heretic . anybody get a match and a stake ? happy well , the antichrist be go to come and make any true believer a heretic any way so what be i worry about ? i know the risk before i accept the job . happy 	1
no , that be because the court let the darwiniacs win in alabama and not let the sticker be put in the book . i think that case be in georgia ( a different state ) and so far as i know homosexuality be not involve . however if you want to worry about a legal case you need to look at dover pa . not the sticker case in cobb county .	0

through the medium ' s support of the presupposition taught in high school and under graduate institution people all to often espouse their expertise in their knowledge of the certainty of evolutionary “ theory ” which be most always overwhelmingly lack and incorrect . and you , on the other hand , because you be not educate in science in general , and evolutionary theory ( why the quotation mark ? ) specifically , be qualify to correct those of us who spend year in study of the topic .	1
this standard get ever complicate . the 2 2 wk old baby inside the mother have `` less value `` to you it seem . actual location determine a value . someone else determine the value on someone . it really be confuse . i just do not understand how value it relative to other thing . even more so when it come to human math be confuse too , do not mean we should get rid of it .	1

i do not know what i think about this . personally , i believe that cain and seth do marry their sister . i know , sound like incest , and today that be what it would be . however , you need to remember that there be no exact set of law at the beginning of the creation . almost all of god ' s follower be speak to by him and be give vision and angel to tell them what to do . i do not believe it be consider incest till the law be write abolish that sort of thing . i be not sure about him create other woman either , but you could be right . after all , i have find the idea of him create life on other planet after the creation acceptable ( still wonder about the end of the creation where he stop though ) so with that view in mind , i suppose it ' s possible . yea i agree with you on how there be no exact se t of law at the beginning of creation . the reason i say that they most likely do not marry their sister be mostly cause god get mad at cain and place a mark on his head so everyone he run across will not kill him unless they want to die a death 10 time bad than his . kinda just say that there be other people out there .	0
what be show very clearly from all of these scientific interpretation of the same evidence be that there be two way to interpret it . unfortunately for you , that be not show , the evidence point in one direction , and one direction only . that of evolution and to the fact that the flood never happen .	1
the common element share by flood myth be a surfeit of water . in order to be consider as evidence of a global event , all of them must have happen at the same time . do they ? another question that shouild be answer be . . . if the bible say that noah and a few member of his family be the only one to survive this ' global ' flood , how come there be so many other account of others survive a flood ? do god miss the target ( that be the whole of humanity ) ? genesis 6:13 ( new international version ) 13 so god say to noah , ' i be go to put an end to all people , for the earth be fill with violence because of them . i be surely go to destroy both them and the earth . presumably he also know from the beginning of time that he be go to make this great big # # # # - up . how embarrassing !	1

actually , yes i do support full medical care for our veteran with injury sustain while serve their country . i do not know why you would think i do not . the issue be that the government have never do anything efficiently or effectively within estimate budgetary constraint . name one government agency or beaurocracy which run within its budget . and the estimate cost for this socialized medicine be 2 trillion dollar over what , 10 year ? and the estimate actual cost be trillion more than that very conservative estimate . but you do not care about fact . you do not even want to take the time to actually read the bill . just pass it now and worry about the consequence later . print up more money until a dollar be not worth a mexican peso . emoticonxgood now be not that a terribly socialistic position to take ? but , i be confuse by it at the same time , for socialist like you do not really want to kill the goose that lay the golden egg now do you ? emoticonxrolleyes when logic fail , there ' s alway ad hominem , right ? and the ad hominen continue . we be large , more diverse , more litigious , need i go on ? leave the continue ad hominem aside , one of the cause for our high healthcare cost be litigation . since the dnc survive on the money derive from the blood - suck trial lawyer lobby , i do not see real reform occur until we cut those purse string along with the big pharma ' s .	0

the civil union argument be a disingenuous one . those people who be fight against the right of gay to marry do not want to see same - sex couple receive any right or recognition of their relationship . the author of all those constitutional amendment ensure that there be no recognition of any other type of relationship in their wording . why should any of us settle for something that these very same people be go to attempt to deny anyway ? you bring up a very interesting point . all those state level marriage amendment which be vote on also make civil union illegal as well . when poll , resident in those area be actually unaware that the amendment also outlaw civil union . so , not only be the anti ' s disingenuous as far as what they promote , but be so in how these amendment be promote .	0

my second disagreement with the paper be a computer would be useless to model live system , because a computer can not model volition , the define characteristic of life . well firstly we do not know that `` volition `` must be embody in living organism only - computer might be capable of exhibit it . i think you will find that there be no valid reason for believe otherwise . and volition itself be not a defining characteristic of life . no biologist would buy that assumption . sponge , bacteria , corn plant etc etc etc be mindless organism and so far as can be determine do not act out of volition .	0
hey , let me jump in on this one . creation science have find nothing . there be no ifs , buts or maybes , on this one . creation science be wrong and have be prove so by the scientific community time and time again . look at pretty much any post on this forum and you will see this . every time a creat bring up an argument , the secular resident of this site beat them down with logic and reason . no creat argument have stand up to the test of science . pure and simple . point me toward the right way then ? if creationists be wrong then why be evolution right ? this be a biased answer base on your belief . please tell us how creationists be wrong . i would gladly like to see you try !	1

i do not see any problem with the jehova ' s or any other ' s idea of a scriptural account . once the debate have begin , i will not make another post until the end . one week sound reasonable - you might want to post within a short gap later on , but that will be up to the person post . you should both be able to post in your own time . a week be sufficient , i should think . i recommend that no limit be place on post , but that it be recommend that post stay generally small . it ' s far more challenging to be succint than to write gallon . one more tip : it ' s a good idea to , in your first post , include definition so that term might be clarify , and it avoids later , unecessary hassle . if we just wait for hank ' s clarification on those few point , then we can then begin ! i know this would be somewhat of a drain on your time but i think it would be helpful if you would make a short post at the end of each post state how much time the next poster have , what post number this be , how many be leave , any comment concern go outside the rule , etc .	0

but why do this generation get to bypass the same authority that every other generation before them submit to with their parental oversight ? how be it right now for 13,14 and 15 year old kid to make such adult decision without their parent know ? be you suggest that 13 year old girl be mature enough emotionally to make such adult decision about get an abortion ? and if so , do you then also believe that a 13 - 15 year old should be allow to adopt a child ? or to enter into a contract to purchase a home or car ? because those be also adult decision and it do not seem reasonable to me that we should allow them to slide on emotionally damaging decision about sex or abortion and then insist they be not mature enough to participate in other adult decision . kid need consistency in order to grow up to be responsible adult and by your way of thinking , you will just add more confusion and insecurity in an already difficult time in an adolescents life . yes , because its their decision , its their stomach , and its their life . i agree that some decision do need to be make with parental consent , but not this one . irrelevant . how do purchase a house have to do with abortion ? ok , so what if the kid want to have the baby and the adult want to get rid of it ? what if the adult want her to have the baby and the kid want to get rid of it ? you would force the kid to have a child ( that do not seem responsible at all ) , or you would force the kid to abort her child ( thereby take away her son or daughter ) . both of those decision do not sound very consitent or responsible . the decision be best leave up to the person that be pregnant , regardless of their age .	0
apparently , you have five question . if by ' ability for inward perspective ' you imply the ability to look at one ' s self , it be incongruent to say you be leary of our ability ' to think of life from a gay perspective ' . what you be ask be for people to see your trouble from your perspective . hardly possible for many . yes . be i a logical gay man , i would accept the fact that i can not marry a man due to the definition of marriage . i would accept that fact and continue to demand that all legally join couple share the same benefit now give to married couple . you say you can not see it from the gay perspective , then you speak from that perspective as a gay man . this be confuse . as a heterosexual , if you be one , would you give up those right and let gay have the right ?	0

for obvious reason we christian have always be adamant supporter of civil liberty when it come to freedom of religion . we have even manage to be consistent in this principle by not oppose the right of buddhist , new agers , or even satanist to meet , because we realize that to do so would equally undercut our own right to assemble . perhaps the thought of undermine religious freedom send through our mind flash of those day when the emperor nero use to ignite christian as human torch to light the street of rome at night . the persecution against the early church have ingrain into our christian consciousness the incredible value of live under a government that protect the interest of religion . but in the case of civil same - sex marriage , instead of recognize the civil right issue at stake here , we oppose the idea , quote bible verse and appeal to moral , nature , tradition , history , and the fear that western civilization as we know it will come crashing to the ground . all of these argument be relate , of course . they be an appeal to that part of american society in which judeo - christian value be still deeply root . for even in america at the dawning of the 2 1 st century , many people ' s understanding of morality and nature still reflect the vestige of the western christendom of our heritage , as do their idea of tradition , history and an ideal society . we do not , however , argue against civil same - sex marriage in the spirit of calm persuasion . there be desperation in our tone . there be also a great deal of fear and mean - spiritedness in our rhetoric , to the point where we even accuse homosexual ( without much proof , i might add ) of be child molester and sexual predator , and of seek to corrupt our youth by recruit them into their `` lifestyle . `` there be probably many people who think they be justify in have such fear , but it seem to me it be more than just paranoia that feed our frenzy . we feel deeply threaten , for we sense that we be lose the battle . not simply the battle against homosexual , but the battle to hang on to what we still think of as `` christian america . `` at one time in this country we could count on quote a verse from genesis or leviticus before congress or the supreme court and that would be the end of the debate . no more . the consensus of common biblical value on which we have once depend be give way to the pluralism of a postmodern society . and see the disastrous handwriting on the wall , we have become politically desperate , and so we lunge at the enemy of christendom with a ferocity that rival that of even the most radical gay activist . the other article on her website be also well worth reading : musing on christianity , homosexuality & the bible	0

it have a chance . any scientist have the opportunity to study id . we be discuss the science classroom . we already teach it as a hypothesis in most school . but it simply should not be teach as a valid alternative to evolution . that ' s what this debate be over . today ' s student be tomorrow ' s scientist . they be unlikely to study something that , if they hear about it at all , they hear about it on a less serious level than they do the happenstance origin of atheist evolution . to reduce id to other class like literature or social science , etc .

oh , and btw , cooperative mechanism of evolution be perfectly compatible with darwinian mechanism . it ' s still a matter of determine which genomes survive into the next generation , and if gene that have ' learn ' how to cooperate be good survivor than those that compete too aggressively , then darwinian theory predicts they should increase their frequency in the population . biologist have use game theory extensively to model how balance between cooperation and competition can be maintain in a genetic population . but what we get from this sort of perspective be not a refutation of darwinian thinking , but a more complete perspective . so why have darwinists ignore symbiosis for decade if it be so compatible ? same with developmental biology ? why have developmental biologist be lock away in closet , never to be hear from until recently when they have force themselves upon the scientific community ? the reality be you have no choice : accept that organisms cooperate with each other and respond purposefully and intelligently to the environment or else . tell me though : do you now admit that individual evolve , not population ?	1

then why can not a man opt out of fatherhood when a mass of tissue be just that a mass a tissue . i believe a man should be able to opt out of fatherhood . the problem with this article for me be the moral ambiguity - there be no consistent argument lay out for free choice , that be choice for woman and men , or even one for consistent slavery ( forced birth from woman , force money from men ) . it reek of the vindictiveness that can be see in any number of fringe movement , of the `` i do not really care whether we live in a just society , as long as you be not treat good than me `` . so yes , i `` a real pro - choicer `` agree with matt here , the pro - choicers who be portray as disagree appear to be some kind of stereotype 1 9 7 0 s feminist - socialist - activist - bra - burning type .	0
] how many different way can toe be invalidate ? in a scientific theory , there be no exception - - exception mean hole - - hole mean trouble . the answer be none so far . your article and the mechanism involve do not impact upon toe which make only very broad assumption about heritable element . and what you reference do not constitute a hole in toe , although it may be a new mechanism of inheritance . yea , i often forget toe be a mental concept , not a scientific one . nothing - - and i mean nothing - - will ever dismantle it in the mind of the faithful . materialism be so entrenched in your mind that even if an animal generate a new piece of morphology by mere think , sensation or awareness , and then pass that trait down to progeny , ( which have be show on here ) you still think materialism stand . it ' s an unfalsifiable mindset that you and million of others have create for yourselves .	1

you be just play dumb , right ? there will be few technician and few order for equipment per insured . their pay will not be cut . there will be few of them per insured . initially the absolute volume will increase . well then this do not answer my question . if you have 10 doctor for 100 people ( this be just an example ) and only 50 of them have health insurance and each doctor get pay $ 100 a year then your health care per caput be $ 10 ( [ 1 0 doctor x $ 100 ] / 100 people ) . if you change it to 100 people with health insurance you now have $ 10 per caput as well because you population do not change . health care cost be show per caput and not per person insured : per caput health expenditure by country , 2007 — infoplease . comso again , if you go from $ 6,000 per caput per that website give above to say switzerland level at $ 4,100 per caput then where do that money come from ?	0
no , they be the same specie . if you put all these fish in the same pool at the end they would all breed with each other . the example wasn ' t of speciation , merely of a change in a population drive by the environment , which be the essense of evolution . agree that they be still the same specie , much like the `` 13 specie `` of darwin ' s finch , and i have no problem with evolution in that respect . i can even see the plausibility of different subspecies evolve eventually into different specie if they be geographically separate for a sufficiently long time . but i still do not see where evolution , in that sense of the term , can account for dozen of specie of monkey occupy the same patch of rainforest , or dozen of specie of gazelle occupy the same patch of grassland .	0
“ we think that the idea itself be important , that this be a really powerful approach to a very major question , ” say funk , “ but we think there be no way in the world that we be actually go to get statistically significant result . ” the reason for his doubt be the incompleteness and lack of uniformity of ecological data . “ there be all these specie out there and so few of them be know in intimate detail , so any kind of ecological characterization – through no fault of ecologist – will be limit in accuracy and precision , ” funk say . i think the fsm throw these guy a bone . they cherrypicked which taxon would give them the most statistically significant result . if they be to expand the method to include more and more taxon , they ' d see the noodly appendage of the fly spaghetti monster . ramen .	0
what the theory of evolution state be that monkey and ape come from a common ancestor , and that human be ape from a taxonomy point of view . roflmao ! nice way of restate the ' inaccurate ' statement basically the same way .	1

no i do not think that all life come from a single - celled ancestor in the distant past . the first reason for this be my faith in the inherent word of god . secondly , throughout my college education ( major in molecular biology ) i have observe the complexity of the single - cell , and find it impossible to believe that it occur by accident ( though that may not be the best choice of word ) . the more and more we learn about cellular structure , the more complex we find it be and how these complexity be require in order for life to be present at all . so , faith and argument from incredulity . if you find it impossible please state exactly what part be impossible . then maybe an actual scientist could take over . major in molecular biology ? not even a full degree ; not like your go to do anything original .	1
how do we rationally explain these creature existence so recently in our human history if they be extinct for million of year ? and if they be the imaginings of bronze age sheep herder as your atheist / evolutionist would have you believe , then how do these ignorant people describe creature we can now recognize from fossil evidence ? and while your at it , ask yourself if it ' s reasonable that the bone of dead creature have survive from 60 million year to some estimate to be more than 200 million year without become dust ? how about this explanation - you be read way too much into your precious bible .	1
