the laws of physics are short , descriptive statements that describe the operation of certain natural phenomena that always seem to occur in the same way . many times the " laws of physics " have been amended by further information , causing the law to be restated . actually , i think he meant the way that we have observed the universe and all of nature to operate .	0
well , the actual personality of the computer is in the hard drive . ram really is not anything but a notebook , and the motherboard is more of a nervous system . so the processor and hardrive is the mind - the processor being the modivator , and the hard drive being the memory . if i were to take the intel p3 out and place an athlon <tong> 3000 + in it ' s place , would the computer be a different computer ? no . it would be the same computer .	0

and i just say that it would be unjust and unfair of you to force metaphysical belief systems of your own which constitute religious belief upon your follows who may believe otherwise than you . get pregnant and treat your fetus as a full person if you wish , nobody will force you to abort it . let others follow their own beliefs differing or the same . otherwise you attempt to obtain justice by doing injustice . mo	0

considering what you turkeys did to the state of california , with its budget and social depravity , you have no room to talk . i am surprised the lord has not cast san francisco and l.a. into the pacific ocean yet .	1
i am trying to become a going in to college for pre - med and i am shocked at the big decline in competion for such courses . not only has obamas healhcare programs overestimated the capability of our current amount of healthcare providers , but it is also deterring many from seeking such careers . by trying to help everyone in the short term , he is doing more damage to everyone in the long term .	0
very well said , but remember , evolution doesnt mean atheism , but creationism means religion . i know christians that believe in evolution , but i dont know atheists that believe in creationism .	0

and we have an emotional post with no substance whatsoever . i am sure your twin will be checking in soon . i think i will keep a count of this type of post .	1
the point is that there are plenty of issues that go on in church meetings and denominational conventions that are areas of enormous disagreement <elongated> and struggle . it happens - - it ' s not just this issue . you just do not hear about them because the press is not interested in those issues .	0
<allcaps> roflmao </allcaps> ! nice way of restating the ' inaccurate ' statement basically the same way .	1
yea they get over it in a year or two . ha <elongated> ha <elongated>	1
so have i , since i know that evolution has and does take place . but i catch it from both sides because i do not believe the scientific explanation of the origins of life or the beginning of intelligent awareness .	0
i think that ' s a good question . i also wonder how long the medical establishment has had this rule ? since there must be some long - standing procedures in executions in the united states that require , by law , a doctor ' s supervision .	0
because everyone is equal in the eyes of the law , and rightly so . as for moral standing , you see no problem with equating his immoral behaviour with your own response . most would .	0
because apes , monkeys and chimps are on different paths . you would not expect a shark to evolve into a barracuda - like animal . things evolve to fill niches , we currently fill a niche , there is nothing pushing apes , chimps or other primates to fill a niche that is occupied .	0

<allcaps> you liar </allcaps> . you are distorting the truth the same way moore did . the truth is the <allcaps> nra </allcaps> event was planned 1 year before the killings in littleton . the truth is the <allcaps> nra </allcaps> rally was canceled excpet for the officers meetings which is required by <allcaps> law </allcaps> to <allcaps> not be canceled </allcaps> . <allcaps> heston </allcaps> said " <allcaps> from my cold dead hands </allcaps> " in north carolina 1 year later . and what transcript are you talking about ? the transcript is posted above . what big pro - gun rally are you talking about in denver . do you mean the one that <allcaps> never </allcaps> happened ?	0
would you consider yourself philosophical ? no , i do not think philosophy is useful . everything they claim that cannot be supported by science is simple word games , like the ontological argument . lolzor is the first person i have discussed philosophy with ever , and i am not impressed with philosophy ' s lack of demonstrative capabilities .	0
and the scientific papers do not . the problem here is that creationists do not read the scientific papers . in fact , most can not even understand them .	1

anyway duo_maxwell this is not only creationist debaters , there are many more who do the same thing with different debates . you also forgot7 . make random accusations of logical fallacies when they have no idea what they even mean . example : you said that my spelling is wrong , that ' s the biggest strawman i have ever heard8 . correct spelling mistakes and convienantly not answer the question . example : " what do you thinkk of carbon dating ? " " you spelled think wrong " . if you want to correct spelling , fine but answer the question as well .	0
what ! you mean that we do not want to do all of those things ? who knew ? i did not get the memo ? emoticonxconfused and you forgot " make seniors eat dog food " . emoticonxgood	1
why ? that does not make alot of sense . we say gas go over $2 during a period of relatively low demand . why would gas stabalize that a price that is lower then what it was during a period of low demand when high demand is projected with increases consumption in china the us and the industralized world as a whole ? oh yes , i am asking the person who thinks that cds are good investments during periods of low inflation . emoticonxrolleyes	1

every single time you make the assisinine statement ' the baby is not the woman ' s body ' you downplay the part the woman ' s body plays . maybe it is not the body - but it can not live without the woman ' s body . the owner of said body should be making decisions for said body . when you are willing to force pregnancy against the will and without the voice of the woman who is pregnant - you are hi - jacking her body . i forget - are you one of those force the rape victim to carry the baby lifers ? pretty close and i will fight you hard if you try trample one inch of it . i still do not give a damn what they may or may have not have thought about abortion , nor was that an argument i was trying to make .	1

very well said . however , we also believe that gun owners should get as much training as possible , necessary , desired etc . it just should not be required to participate in a right recognized by your constitution as inalienable , and therefore protected . that sets a bad precedence for the rest of our bill of rights . however , safe handling of any potentially dangerous tool is just common sense .	0
just how do you suppose the government seeking permision would work in reality ? and what exactly are you afraid of ? it seems odd when people advocate blind trust for joe civilian , but then think that the government should not be allowed to be armed . i think there must be a balance in trust given both ways .	0
i assume you can demonstrate that everyone that opposes or critiques gay rights are personally attacking an individual or group ? please , be my guest	1
' we the people of the united states , in order to form a more perfect union , establish justice , insure domestic tranquility , provide for the common defence , [ 1 ] promote the general welfare , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity , do ordain and establish this constitution for the united states of america . ' there you go , easy and archy . that ' s the only part that matters when it comes to the purpose for the founding of this country . notice that it it based on the authority of ' we the people ' . it does not say , ' in the name of jesus . ' perhaps you either of you can tell me how many times god is mentioned ? how many times is jesus mentioned ? how many times is religion mentioned ? you failed at the first test . can you do better at the second ?	1
that seems unlikely . he gets banned everywhere he goes with his multiple names . he ' s not very good at hiding his identity and not very good at controlling his temper when dealing with the sort of creation believing <allcaps> x <elongated> </allcaps> that you get frequenting these boards ( i can not say i blame him on the latter point ) . look around the web though and you will find him elsewhere . <repeated>	0

you your qualifications in logic allow you to judge that ? i suspect that you are talking out of your elbow since i have not seen any evidence that you know what logic is . mostly i see hysteria and superstition in your posts .	1
i believe alan keyes already have used that term on us . ( alan keyes , the ultra - concervative republican candidate for the illinois senate seat - in opposition to barack obama . the maryland resident the republican party had to recruit because they could not find anyone else in their right mind who would go against barack . also the very same maryland resident / television talkshow host who beratted hilary clinton for moving to ny and expecting to be able to " represent " ny ' ers . yeah , look who ' s the hypocrit now . )	1

still clueless and still presenting a barrel of laffs i see . have someone that can read and comprehend spell it out for you . i bet yer mun is considering that to get you out of the basement . how ' s the weight loss coming by the way ?	0
again , nonrandom is not the same as lamarckian . phenotypic variation can be nonrandom because the organisms can select the most attractive / successful mates with whom to breed . once again , you are totally stuck on one aspect of the toe , random mutation ; the toe is much more than that .	0
i thought you had vowed never to post in this forum again . ? <repeated> i suppose with your views on divorce , your wedding vows have as much weight as your vow not to post here .	1
no reply bassman ? seriously mate , i can understand why some people on this forum have a problem with you , you can not just go around posting total lies ! you are a sensible guy , for the most part , lets have some reasonable arguments as oppose to mindless bigotry .	1
i take by your redundant posts that you havent read the previous 20 . <repeated>	1
it ' s as much of a point that phillp johnson has . trying to use philip johnson as a source about evolution is like trying to use jack chick as a source about catholism .	1

but if this was a republican program , you ' d have no problem with it . you are a rightwing hypocrite , archie baby .	1
i guess that you did not look at my last link . there are recalls every year that effect millions of cars , and those companies are not being bullied by the government . the point is every car company has recalls , and the government is targeting toyota . ford , gm , buick all have recalls . why are they not targeted ? so , the government is the almighty paternalistic big brother punishing those bad and irresponsible companies who only care about themselves and wreck endless destruction to society and the environment . no , toyota is committed to fixing faulty accelerator only because of accusations for causing accidents .	0
not the same thing at all ! most gay pride floats are moade of crate paper and glue guns . not gold . i think you have stratched this one really far . nice try , thanks for playing . try again soon ! wow , nicotine cravings make me a mean person !	1
but there seem to be so darn many of them , everywhere you look among the religious right . why is that ? can not they go out and recruit people with iqs somewhat above room temperature ?	1
notice that even in this version there are elipses just before the quote in question . my bet is if we were to actually refer to this 44 years old book , simpson would not be saying what toxey wants him to say .	0
how is that a strawman ? your challenge directly relies upon something you assume to be proven , but has not been . therefore even in a hypothetical stance , your underlying arguments are invalid , thus leading to everything else being invalid . you are not doing so well on this forum .	0
yes , the byzantines are a catholic rite . the catholic church is divided into rites - there are seven i believe , the roman , of course , being the largest . the byzantine catholics are an eastern catholic rite , and as you said are almost identicle to the orthodox churches except that they acknowledge the pope as the head of the church . east to west , a website regarding all the churches of the catholic church , especially those of the east . real quick , the orthodox acknowledge the pope as the successor of peter , but not as the head of the church . am i correct ?	0
sheeple never understand where money comes from nor do they know cliffs even exist . full bellies , breeding , mindless entertainment and a government sheppard are their sole requirements .	1
what country are you from ? in america the people have never had the ability to decided law . the legislature writes it , the executive approves it , and the judiciary interprets it . the people have no direct say what so ever .	1
' most biblical scholars ' ? if you mean they think the letters are forgeries and were not at least dictated by paul , then it ' s just not true that most biblical scholars think that . i agree in terms of the idea that paul in some cases had someone else actually put the words on paper and he told them what to write , but that ' s pretty irrelevant here , <allcaps> imo </allcaps> .	0
so , all knowledge is ignorance , and all events not in the present are ignorance . i am not following you here . how about we leave the definitions as they are , so that we can differentate true from false ? calling everything ignorance does not move us forward in the debate . if we accepeted your claim , we are typing ignorance and concuding ignorance , so what would the point be ?	1
not only do their superiors in higher courts think they are a joke , but their peers in other circuit courts think they are a joke .	0
i will not hold my breath awaiting a retraction of this piece of balderdash you have composed . guess we will chalk it up to puffery .	1
and creationism was investigated and explored completely and shown to be false .	1
if we could rub a brass lamp , make three wishes and fix our energy problems immediately , i ' d agree with you . but since we live in the <allcaps> real world </allcaps> , we must become <allcaps> oil independent </allcaps> while we are perfecting and building an infrastructure of renewable energy sources .	1
but that does not answer the question . why is dawkins a x <elongated> to believe as he does ? it seems that you have no answer except to throw out indiscriminate insults at people you know nothing about . in a previous post you stated , ' the guys a simpleton . ' that does not make sense as there is no verb in the sentence . ' guys ' is the plural of ' guy ' . you do not seem to be aware that the contraction for ' guy is ' is ' guy ' s . ' your error is caused by ignorance whereas trebor ' s is clearly a typo caused by the proximity of the ' e ' and ' d ' keys . do you have a better explanation for our origins that does not involve magic and dirt ?	0
nothing anyone has said has proven anything i have said wrong in any way because all you have are unprovable and unproven assumptions . now go over to the other debate creation versus evolution like a good little boy and you will get my response to tiktaalik . nkay <elongated> ?	1
i believe you have even debated that it is conditioned into humans to be religious and therefore it validates religions . so why is there a need to debate whether animals love if they are acting on a conditioned response ?	0
but the question is can you prove your belief system is true ? and all you have done is spew hate for religion but have not even tried to actually answer the question . and ask yourself this . if the idea of god is such a man made plague , then god does not even exist right ? so if god does not exist then what has he done to you to make you so venomous and angry at him ? why would you be so angry at a non existent being ? i challenge you to come up with a rational answer .	1
i know , maybe the american criminals will just import guns in with their mexican illegal drugs . i do not know for sure but i believe the mexican drug gangs would not mind another revenue stream . net results , zilch , nada , zero . but you know that ! emoticonxsmilie gun control is nothing but a scam !	1

that ' s quite a leap , even for you . how did you know that the officiers were pro - life ? or that any pro - life people would condone the officiers ' behavior in this instance . i certainly think it was excessive . i guess i must not be pro - life by your illogic .	1
wow . <repeated> you are bent on harping on creationists arguments at whatever the cost . first of all , you are not even considering that the majority of people are misinformed of what evolution is not because they have creationist motives , but because they go to the dictionary for definitions	0
the simple and most usual one would be bluntly that marriage is and always has been between members of the opposite sex . there may possibly have been some strange aberrations in the past but essentially that has always been the bottom line even for homosexuals . in addition to those there will be those who oppose it on religious grounds . and why should not they if they so wish ? marriage is an institution not a right . if you do not qualify then you do not enter . by all means campaign to have the rules changed but do not be surprised if they are not .	0
recent studies apparently show that pot is more harmful than you say . one joint is said to contain more carcinogens than four tobacco cigarettes . i doubt your 20,000 joints theory . you have a simplistic argument going for pot . i can not agree that legalizing all drugs would be a good thing either . programs in holland have failed to produce significant if any benefits to society in general . the druggies seem to have benefitted by having arrest - free drug zones and access to whatever they want , but the cost of drugs still requires some income , something that most of them likely do not have other than from crime , begging or social programs . one " benefit " i see from legalizing drugs is that the users could be more easily identified .	0
and if there are two competing hypotheses that are actually hard to choose between ? as they get closer , it becomes less possible to choose by instinct or testing . a principle comes in handy .	0

all born children , and every woman had the right to be rid of them . killing them is not required as abortion is when they are in the womb ( during the timeframe the majority of abortions occur , at least ) . they are not comparable .	0
um , bassman , so you , the one person in the world who is as " pure as the wind - driven snow , " is the one who may judge others , including democrats . um , for the record i grew up on the prairie and saw a goodly bit of " wind - driven snow " and it was not particularly pure . a feeble and laughable metaphor .	1
and yet , even though creationists ask for detailed lists of every creature in transition over a period of several million years , i have never found a single creationist who can trace his ancestors back to adam , a period of only about 6,000 years . the best i can do is to trace my ancestors back to the 1 6 0 0 s .	0
but the point is why are there relatively few creationists . the reason is that the creationist position cannot be defended in open debate . that is why creationist boards censor opposing views . on boards where creationists are not protected there are few .	0
well , i guess you can refuse to see something that ' s pretty obvious . it ' s up to you .	1
oh dear , deluded philisopher nutter alert . no one can empirically prove anything . fact . end of discussion .	1

well , let us be honest here . people fear gay marriage , not that it might come about via judicial fiat . that ' s just the current whipping horse because that ' s how it happened first , for some broad values of judicial fiat of course . there was a recent post here about rights granted gays by their state legislature , oregon i think , and a group jumped in and forced the law on hold via a petition drive . so it really is not the means by which gays get equality that upsets some folks , it ' s the equality itself . " judicial fiat " is just a phrase people can use so they can avoid stating their true motives , preventing gays from being treated as equals .	0
i think hip hop and the arts are reflections of society . it is good to bring these issues to light , if only so that those who would not normally be aware of them are enlightened .	0
well of course it ' s about petitions that would lead to amendments . what else would it be about ? nevertheless it is still a voting process . that ' s how amendments are done . what i am asking is , does this bill mean that <allcaps> any </allcaps> issue that could come up as an amendment would be illegal ? and if not , ( the more important question ) how would they determine what constitutes civil rights . ( which you did not answer , but rather basically said ' i do not know but rest assured they do ' ( to paraphrase ) . get it now ? anyway , on further review , i believe that the bills only apply to whatever falls under the catagory of ' civil rights ' , however the heck that is to be determined ! emoticonxdonno	0

it looks like you have tried to analize everything i say as being ' my ' life experiences . i really enjoy your abuse , i would love to meet up with you some day . my life is fantastic actually . i dont know why i have to keep repeating that . what about those in haiti right now ? what about others ? i think they are more important than your fucking sulking over the americans lousy pronunciations . or me whining over you being an arsehole . as for amy winehouse , no reputable establishment would dare touch the skank .	1
i think we should not only allow gays to have legal marriage rights but also those who want to practice insist as well as all who want to practice polygamy . let us not stop there let us sanction union between human and animals . after all i love my dog and my parrot . why stop with gays ? by the way where does the term <allcaps> gay </allcaps> come from for homosexuals .	1
you lie . you keep saying the same things over and over again , that does not make them true . your addiction to violence is showing . tony martin shot an unarmed 16 year old kid in the back as he was running away . that ' s not self - defence , that ' s cold blooded murder . it is not the role of individuals to exact revenge for crimes committed against them . you do not get to take the law into your own hands . munir hussain ran after the intruders and beat them up with a cricket bat in the street . that ' s not self - defence , that ' s revenge .	0
oh , undoubtedly - but the offspring are not inheriting traits as such are they ? they are just suffering the same symptoms of malnutrition as their parents , except that for them it ' s happening in vitro so they exhibit the effects from birth . that ' s why it ' s such a bad example for what you are trying to get others to accept .	0
the word touched me in a bad place . <repeated> i think it was at summer camp or something . <repeated> i am still scarred . <repeated> no but seriously even i do not believe that . <repeated> how exactly is word spiritual ? is it intentional ? based upon the interpretation an individual gets from it ? seeing as how the history of the bible itself and it ' s original writings , many interpretations , denominations , and debates over itself is construed it can hardly be seen as itself being spiritual . is it possible that through god the manuscripts and texts stir inside a person a level of spirituality ? yes . but when you go buy a bible at barnes and noble it certainly is not glowing with the essence of god . <repeated> it ' s debated if even the ark of the covenant itself if it still exists has the essence of god to this day . <repeated>	0

dont begin to understand real love till 18 or older i felt real love when i was 13 , and i was with that woman i loved for years . saying someone can not effectively do something until they reach a certain age is ridiculous ; turning a certain age does not magically make you any wiser nor dumber .	0
even then , your statement does nothing . they are not " getting themselves pregnant " . a doctor is doing a medical procedure , that may or may not result in a pregnancy ( ya know , those little sperm thingies ? ) emoticonxangel	1
yes , you are missing something . how come age does not start at conception ? how come when babies are born they are not 9 months old instead of , well , seconds old .	0
well , good , i am glad as heck you have a mom you can tell that to . mine would have hit the roof , and then hit me on the way back down . did she flip or was she pretty cool about it ? just remember ( who would we be if not preachy ? us ol ' adults , we do not know nuthin ' ) that b . c . is not one hundred percent reliable or that condoms can break and you can still get nasty bugs all kinds of different ways .	1
i can not vouch for what others believe . the creeds are a pretty accurate summary of my beliefs as regards who and what god is . the apostles ' creed is the statement of belief used at baptism in most of christianity , so it would be strange for someone to have been baptised ( or confirmed if they were baptised as an infant ) without believing this to be true . to be honest i am surprised by the idea that people ( outside the pseudo - christian sects like the mormons and jehovah ' s witnesses ) who claim to be christians would not believe what is stated in the creeds , it ' s not something that really occurred to me . i know that some people misunderstand the use of the word catholic in the last paragraph but that ' s about it .	0
talk about a crock ! how can you wail on anyone with your imaginary truth stick of no mercy when you would not know the truth if you tripped over it ? and you going ballistic like this just proves the exact point i made in that you will allow my free speech until i say something you disagree with and then you attack me to shut me up . which is exactly what i said above that precipitated your childish tirade . see ?	1
if you want to use this arguement then you are assuming a right to free speech seperate from the 1 st amendment . you are applying the first amendment but rather assuming ' free speech ' is a right granted outside of the constitution . i believe our argument is dealing with applying the first amendment to the states . the case did not deal with the first amendment at all . where did you get that idea from ? it dealt with religion but that is about as close as it gets . ok ? was there ever any doubt that the 1 st amendment was incorporated since cantwell ?	0

lets see im going to ask you some questions . are you ? are you a ? do you have blue eyes ? do you have brown eyes ? now if you say no to one of those things isnt that cosidered an answer ? where i come from its yes or no . 2 possible answers . not just yes every time to get what you want .	0
whoa ! duo . give the kid a chance . it seems that you are skeptical that he can offer empirical ' proof ' that his god exists . certainly , since he is a ' philosophy and theology ' major he must understand the implications of ' proof ' in the context of science , as well as the meaning of the term ' empirical ' . after all , would not those ideas be something that a philosopher would be expected to understand ? so let us await his ' empirical proof ' without laughter . wait until he presents his ' empirical proof ' before we laugh .	1

judicial activism ? what brand of stupid is it that you use ? what judicial activism do you see here ; the judge stating that open carry is legal and has been , and that you can not be arrested when you have not committed a crime ? or that the police can be sued for damages when they choose to break the law to persecute an innocent bystander ?	1

in some cases yes , in others no . if the mutation gives a huge advantage , then there will be a decline in the size of the gene pool for a while ( eg when the australian rabbit population was reduced form 500 million to 100 million by myxomatosis , the gene pool strunk as a result and the genetic " mutation " that gave increased resistance spread throughout the whole population as a result ) . most of the time though single mutations do not have such a huge advantage and so genetic variation is maintained .	0
you said there that you wanted guns in schools so that kids could defend themselves . how is that a misinterpretation ? you are asking for proof of a negative . how many massacres would have occured if guns were common in school ? we do not know . <repeated> erm . <repeated> you are saying that people do not try to harm one another over those things ? i suggest you surf youtube for a bit . rememeber however , that kids are more emotionally unstable than adults . hormones and guns are not a good combination . i agree that ' s silly . i am more worried about your statement that students should carry in class .	0

no it ' s not . perhaps because you do not understand much about evolutionary theory you have confused it with id . id is not science and has no evidence to support it .	0
and that is meaningless babble . evolution is a process that has been observed whether you like it or not . it is not a moral statement nor is it a statement of faith . it does not deal with government , laws or culture . whining about it will not change it .	0
no peeling , it would be , " we proved it was possible to evolve as humans have , so why can only we do it ? " why has not one other creature on earth ever evolved to our level of sophistication in the same alleged 4 billion years that we have had to attain our level of evolution ? if evo is real , then it seems only right that it should touch all species equally and that all species that were not forced into extinction , but survived and overcame the pressures they faced should have ended up in a similar evolved place that man has attained in 4 billion years . unless of course that the science of evolution is a humanistic justification to explain our origins but has no basis in fact what so ever . and that is my claim and belief .	0

yes i do understand this . but you must admit that the instantaneous formation of a living organism , even an extremely primitive one , complete with the complexity of the <allcaps> dna </allcaps> code as a result of random encounters of atoms and molecules is a little too much to buy . there is evidence right there for creationism . only intelligence could have formed such an elaborate complex system for the structure of life and its propagation .	0
oh , i do not think there ' s anything wrong with it , i am completely for it .	0
you should really think about what you say before you say it . i have heard this before and its garbish , i have been around and owned guns my whole life and i have never , not even once , had the thought of getting a gun just because someone # # # # # # me off . i would never use a gun on a person unless that person were a viable threat to my life , such as coming at me with a knife for example .	1
i agree , for the most part . once you get to tanks and helicopters though ? too big , too easy a target for a tyrannical regime . do you see the iraqis and afghanis using tanks and helicopters ? i am sure they could get them if they really wanted , but they are useless against a government that invests in satellite technology and bombers . better to stick with the rocket launchers and mines .	0
so which argument do you want to stick with / the one above that says the black vote was irrelevent or your previous argument in which you claimed was significant . i will refresh your memory : :	1
logic would lead one to believe abortion is wrong . <repeated> but why be consistent in your thinking . the point is , logic and rational thinking is not a requirement to make a law . you can ban abortion is you want . <repeated> the states did it and the constitution allows it , even if 5 legislatures think otherwise .	0

well this involves the free will / determinism debate , you say you are not free if your preferences are implanted . <repeated> i say you are free when you act in accordance with your preferences , regardless of how those preferences were arrived at . i think to claim you need to " choose " your preferences is absurd , as the act of choosing requires prior preferences , which presumably also required a choice . <repeated> and the question of how we acquired our first preference arises . <repeated>	0
sounds like the same skeptic argument above . i do not know about you nu leader , but when i am certain my mind exists . are you not certain ? you are actually required to be , to deny you exist would require existence , and that would be logically contradictory .	0

so how are those gun free zones working out for you ?	1
incorrect . evolution is not something that must be adhered to . it is a scientific theory . as such , if evidence was brought to light that evolutionary theory could not account for , then the theory would be altered or scrapped . it ' s really quite simple .	0

allright , well then i think it ' s odd too , arians would have made more sense . i am surprised they are considered obscure , the council of nicea is historically considered one of the defining moments of the early christian church , and the arian controvery was it ' s main event . for the record , they were discussed in my high school , that ' s why i was making sure .	0
by your logic , do i have to be a murdered to understand that murder is wrong ? this ' walk a mile in my sandals ' stuff is just bs . i do not have to be a woman to view abortion as not being moral .	1
you / he could just have said ' slippery slope ' in the first place ; that argument is an old one , which i though was dealt with a long time ago . you can not disapprove of a on the grounds that it might lead to b - firstly because you have little to no evidence that it will , secondly because a is not necessary for b to happen and thirdly because that difference between a and b is all the argument you need to prevent b but be in favour of a . you can approve of punishing criminals but be against the death sentance .	0
given that i do not hold that opinion , i would challenge you show where i have stated such .	0
that ' s because its sophistry . its an inherent contradiction and it simply means we do not have the capacity to understand it . another more common example is that the assertion that the universe cannot be endless , and yet as far as we know it is . trying to understand it is for us humans like an ant trying to fathom the theory of relativity . damn are we ever conceited as a race . <repeated> we seem to think that if we can not understand something , it cannot be . we also tend to think , in every generation , that we have achieved somehow the pinnacle of progress .	0
and who is the ' we ' that we trust ? the scientists or the theologians , who disagree with each other ? i am curious for it on my own account . <repeated> and not willing just to accept someone ' s authority saying it happened one way or another .	0

reminds me of the cold war clamor of necessary ' defense ' nuclear weapon parity with russia . considering the threats we make directed towards iran and others along with our occupation of iraq , i am surprised our conceit has not made all of me and asia scramble for nukes . pakistan , 97% muslim , hides bin laden , governed by a general constantly avoiding assassination attempts , never a bad word about that us ' ally ' . but they have nukes and delivery systems . i ' d think iran believes , as we have shown , that the us does not spew the democracy at the point of a gun policy to those nations possessing nuclear weapons .	0

really ? so suppose that you have two models for the way the solar system works . you measure where the planets are today in the night sky , and you use both models to predict where the planets will be ten years from now . in ten years you make actual measurements . the predictions of the first model for mars are off by , say , a tenth of a minute of arc . the second model is off by a hundredth of a minute of arc . ( for comparison , the full moon in the sky has a width of about 30 minutes - - i may be wrong about this ) . so , are you saying the first model is wrong ? the error seems to be pretty tiny ( by most standards ) . what about the second ?	0

if homosexuals do not think , how can they choose to become good vaginal penetrators ? the fact is , the more homosexuality there is , the less abortions . if you were a gay you could rest assured that your man - wife would never abort once . are you willing to sacrifice the lives of billions of innocent children to your personal feelings like lust towards vaginas ?	1
i am in total agreement with that statement . unfortunately , parents are passing that mindset on to their children . the us experienced a decline in college enrollment in 2005 , which speaks volumes about us lower education and personal motivation , at the very time other nations have accelerated their production of graduates in science and engineering . we will end up paying a dear economic price for that circumstance . on the bright side , we have a large surplus of business majors to manage our service industry , the down side being their lack of basic reading and writing skills .	0

that ' s just darling , and all . but it still does not indicate that a fetus is a small person . no one denies it ' s alive . no one denies it is of the species homo sapiens . no one denies that an embryo can ultimately become as person , which is the simplistic point of that cloying article . it is personhood of the fetus that is the debate . i do not think it can ever be definitively determined . using dr . seuss was an excellent choice of reference to back your argument , however . i am not sure why you quoted shooter ' s post about a death sentence . however , if you really equate abortion with murder , are you willing to advocate charging the mother and doctor with premeditated murder ?	0

i am not aware that the police used violence in arresting any of the people discussed in this case . besides , i am not discussing personal morality here , i am discussing what should be legal , and what is practical in a society where not everyone shares the same moral views . government is there to apply limits to what is permitted , based on the will of the people .	0

well , if genesis was in fact true , then we would have to assume that god is real and the bible more or less explains what he wants , right ? and if there is someone " up there " who will damn you to eternal torment if you do not do what he wants ( which is one interpretation of the bible ) than that might effect the way you act . i realize that that is not exactly the same as changing your moral compass , but history has demonstrated that most people ' s moral will stretch to accomodate pressing needs , and i think an actual vengeful diety would qualify .	0
straw man . i am not attacking the achievements of science . i am attacking the notion that you have that scientists are exempt from the catalogue of influences that affect everyone else ; with only the slightest admission of a tiny possibility of cultural influence - which was quickly dismissed anyway with the false analogy of comparing evolution to aeronautical engineering .	0
yes that is a problem . but there is an instance when the 2 nd amendment did protect the <allcaps> usa </allcaps> from invaders : " someone at the table asked a japanese admiral why , with the pacific fleet devastated at pearl harbor and the mainland us forces in what japan had to know was a pathetic state of unreadiness , japan had not simply invaded the west coast " - <url> it wasn ' t for the 2 nd amendment you would be speaking japanese if you live on the west coast , german if you live on the east coast .	0
i know this may seem obvious to most people , but it seems to have escaped the notice of creationists . birds are tetrapods , as are amphibians , reptiles , and mammals . birds did not just grow wings . wings are adaptions of the front limbs that were covered with feathers . perhaps you are unaware of the evidence that indicates that maniraptors had feathers , probably for thermoregulation . saying that there is no mechanism for birds to grow wings when they previously had none is like saying that there is no mechanism for mankind to grow arms when he previously had none . you see , mankind ' s closest relatives are the two species of chimpanzee - they are quadrupeds .	1
actually , natural selection tends to preserve a species with only minor changes in a stable environment . but environments tend to change . i do not know what that " incipient organ " junk is supposed to mean . is that another way of saying " what good is half a wing . " well , check out a penguin to find out . look at a seal flipper . it has the same bones , arranged in the same way as a monkey . what good is it for a land animal ? and what does " fully functional " mean ? what function ? perhaps the new organ had a different purpose - take the clawed hands of fossil birds for example . they were good for catching prey and climbing , just like they were for their dinosaur ancestors . but those clawed wings also allowed early birds to fly .	0

when it comes to all the examples that behe had provided in both his first book , and his second book , it has been shown to be able to evolve naturally . that means , in principle , ic systems can evolve . if you do not believe so , bring forth the i.c. system of your choice . to say ' but you do not know all the answers ' is just the logical fallacy known as ' argument from ignorance ' . behe brings a system up that he claims is ic . <repeated> the pathway for evolution is discovered , and behe trys another one . how dishonest can you get ? the concept is falsified .	0
if i were to become upset merely because you told me the ideas were wrong , you might have a point . but i do not ; never have , so far as i recall . an idea can not be stupid , or simple - minded . an idea can be right or wrong , or perhaps partly both . when you describe an idea as stupid , you are saying it is wrong and one would have to be stupid to think that . when you describe an idea as simple minded you are saying it is wrong and one would have to be simple - minded to think that .	0
ez . that is not what i said . i would think a bible website would be good for biblical information , but for archaeological information ? not so much . if you want to provide archaeological evidence of the exodus , why do not you seek out information from an archaeology sources ? please answer this . if i wanted to seek archaeological evidence to confirm something that happened to a people that was written about in their ancient writings , i would not seek a specialist in the ancient writings as a resource , i would seek an archaeology expert . does not that make sense ?	1

what is not only illogical but patently false is the assertion that the unborn baby is making his mother a slave of any kind . did that baby force her to conceive it ? is that baby the equivalent of a tumor as the pro abortionists claim them to be ? no , it is an unborn human being who just needs the time to grow and develop in order to be a sentient being just as we are as we type on these keyboards . that explains everything about how irrational you are ! but based on your posts though , i think they already pulled the plug . emoticonxfrazzledemoticonxdonno	1

to be honest . <repeated> i do not know . but i do know that to argue something is false because the consequences are not desired is a logical fallacy ( appeal to consequences ) . so is the argument i posted earlier ( posted below for quick reference ) true or false ? and if false , why ? a ) only science should be taught in science class ( this is why creationism should not be taught in science class ) . b) science is a collection of testable theories which have been thoroughly observed , identified , described , experimentally investigated and remain unrefuted . conclusion : if a is true and b is valid then science class should only consist of testable theories which have been thoroughly observed , identified , described , experimentally investigated and remain unrefuted .	0

i think there are two separate questions here . ( 1 ) when does personhood begin ?

oh yeah , i do not disagree . i am a massive fan of hitchens , and 99% of everything he said was true . he just happened to be , as you say , misguided on certain issues .	0

oh yes this is all over the news in ireland . irish farmers are having a canary that its the end of ireland ' s sugar industry . and cereal too because of crop rotation . nobody seems to have even thought of the question as to why exactly the eu should pay for an unsustainable industry as oppossed to farmers moving into something profitable . edit : oh and its tied into something about sugar being one of irelands few natural resources . emoticonxbanghead	0

it may only be salvaging to you but to the parents involved it is body theft . let me just ask you to step in our shoes for just 10 minutes imagine trawling around 100 ' s of hospital labs and medical schools seeing all these poor little babies lined up in jars and i do not mean just a few there is up to 50 in each hospital and school imagine looking at those jars hoping that one of them is your child so you can at lastgive him the burial he / she deserves ( a basic human right ) yet at the same time praying that none of them are yours . having done that can you still say that it is only salvage bearing in mind our children were only sent for post mortem and many of us have not seen them since ?	0

quite frankly , that makes absolutely no sense . so conservatives in the blue states will buy more porn because why ? cause they are in a blue state ? and liberals in the red states will buy more porn because why ? cause they arein a red state ? your excuses lack any cogent theory behind the scenario . in science , when people put forth a hypothesis they provide a basis for their claim as to the mechanics of the phenomenon . but with you , you just throw out different ideas with no basis .	0

because the location of the tracks used to be a tidal plane . in other words , it used to be at the edge of the ocean . around that time the sea coast advanced and receded several times . the tracks were buried . the tracks actually had to be uncovered . the tracks were originally discovered immdiately after an unusually severe storm in the area in which an unusual amount of water came down the paluxy . that unusual flow of water washed away the soil that covered some of the tracks . other tracks have been intentionally uncovered . for example , in one case , where a trackway went under a bank , several feet of the bank was removed to expose more tracks .	0

that is just conservative bias . conservatives are just as guilty of the same things as liberals and then each has their own ideological idiocy that is unique to each group . conservatives like classes and do not like change . a pure conservative society would fail just as quickly as a pure liberal one . the last 10 - 20 years as we have become more us vs . them the overall prosperity and well being of the country has declined . with both sides taking the country to extremes . conservatives eased restrictions and corporations run wild . those laws are in place for a reason . liberals overreact and put a choke hold on growth . there was a reason for less restrictive laws , but now they can not do anything meaningful .	0

not really . that ' s the fallacy of exclusion of the middle . because there are only two choices , if one is wrong somehow , the other is therefore correct . the problem is that there is not only two choice for sure . besides , science is wrong all the time , it does not prove that creation is right . in fact , for instance , science estaimtes of moon dust have been proven wildly wrong , and those corrections actually harm creation .	0

yes , because its <allcaps> their </allcaps> decision , its <allcaps> their </allcaps> stomachs , and its <allcaps> their </allcaps> lives . i agree that some decisions do need to be made with parental consent , but not this one . irrelevant . how does purchasing a house have to do with abortion ? ok , so what if the kid wants to have the baby and the adults want to get rid of it ? what if the adults want her to have the baby and the kid wants to get rid of it ? you would force the kid to have a child ( that does not seem responsible at all ) , or you would force the kid to abort her child ( thereby taking away her son or daughter ) . both of those decisions do not sound very consitent or responsible . the decision is best left up to the person that is pregnant , regardless of their age .	0

hey , someone has to clean our toilets . this may sound brutal , but one of the biggest reasons why indians , asians , etc all are heavy on education is because their lives sucked . they did not get a education and they were living in poverty . thus , they seem education , mainly the sciences and the maths as a way to escape poverty . japanese and chinese parents are massively strict on their kids because they want their kids of excel as the parents either were poor or grew up poor and know what that ' s like . this may be necessary for these religious homeschooled folks to find out . spending a life time in poverty or working 3 jobs to make ends meet will change someone ' s view point on education .	1

if i may hijack this thread ( sad to do so as i love seeing people criticise bush ) , i am intrigued by this idea that deindustrialisation is a bad idea . if it is , then most of the world is doomed to live in povety surely ? there is only a finite manufacturing capacity within the word and it is far less than the total number of jobs required throughout the world . we have to be able to have countries that are heavily reliant upon service based jobs . are you sugegsting that this cannot work in the long term ?	0

so basically , what you are advocating here is that public schools should teach no moral values whatever . they should not teach tolerance , because that offends the intolerant ; they should not teach racial equality , because that offends racists ; they should not teach religious freedom , because that offends religious bigots . maybe they should not teach the immorality of theft and murder because that offends thieves and murderers . i am truly surprised to hear a right - winger such as your good self advocating that public schools should promote a moral vacuum . but then , i suppose anything is better than teaching acceptance of gay families as just another sort of family among the many that exist today .	1

and what is an inheritance ? proverbs 13:13 he who feareth the commandment shall be rewarded . 14 the law of the wise is a fountain of life . 15 good understanding giveth favor 16 every prudent man dealeth with knowledge 17 a faithful ambassador is health 18 but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured . 19 the desire accomplished is sweet to the soul 20 he that walketh with wise men shall be wise 21 but to the righteous good shall be paid . what inheritance should a good man leave to his children ' s children ? solomon wasn ' t talking of money , but of god ' s law . in solomon ' s view , the wicked can have their money , the true reward goes to the righteous . why this should contrast with selling your luxuries and giving to the poor i am not sure .	0

the original molecule had some lipolytic function , but removing some amino acids from it , in the right place , made it fit better into the substrate , and thereby greatly increased its functionality . barbarian observes : we thought it would take roughly a million years for bacteria to evolve enzymes capable of digesting nylon ( because the compound is so different than any they were able to digest ) but it took less than a century . .	0
oh i certainly do not pretend that and certainly did not claim that either - - though a couple of left - wing posters here ( who will remain nameless for now ) might take the bizarre step of saying my post to you amounted to as much , if history is any indicator . maybe we will all luck out and they will forget their lenses of bias at home , and instead read claims people actually make .	0
which leaves us with ? if you said ' an appeal to majority ' you win teh prize ! you are not really leaving it to them when you are talking about enacting legislation based on a theory which is still under debate . most doctors will not prescribe marijuana in this country either . i guess we should just leave that to them though , since they are more qualified .	1
religion is nothing but a choice but is constitutionally protected . why ? blacks and homosexuals are two different classes , unless you are a black gay . it is the way each class is treated that is the same . coservative christians view gay people in the same way as the white supremacists view black people . the more religion attacks gay people and our civil rights the more i am begining to believe that the romans had the right idea to rid the world of such filth .	0

your right about the 14 year old and the ten year old but if it is a 18 and 14 should that be legal ? or 18 and 15 ? 16 and 21 is legal ( although it is wrong ) because the youngest one is still legal . age of consent = 16 years old . if your basing it on a year gap what about 10 years ? i am 10 years older than my fiance . before anyone jumps to conclusions i am 38 . and she is 28 . legal ? why ? we are both over 16 . <repeated> period .	0
that ' s a completely different issue jo . if those pro gay sites were accurately translating and interpreting the bible as it intended itself to be translated , i would accept it with open arms . but how can i accept the lies that homosexual apologists attempt to tell by distorting gods truth in order to justify their sin ? you should understand that i can not allow that rather than you using those corrupted sources in order to support what you personally want the bible to say . i welcome anyone to take the content of the links that tell each story within my link above , and disregard the info if any opposing info is found regarding the claims they make . but just attacking it because it ' s a jewish source is ridiculous .	0

so god would rather have evil in the world than infringe freedom . how very libertarian of you , jyoshu . but actually , are evil and freedom inversely proportionate ? look at the examples i gave : slavery is both evil and an infringement on human freedom . on top of that , god puts evil into people and then does not take responsibility when these people do evil things . <repeated> not to mention the evil that he himself has done . murder , genocide , bigotry . <repeated> the lot . if he made people with complete freedom , he <allcaps> must </allcaps> have made people with evil as well . why did he do that ? the only reason i can come up with is that if god made everyone in his image , he himself must be evil , even partially . that that is apparent in the bible .	0

i think that we have got to draw a line at some point , to demarcate between adult and child . where ever we do draw it , it will seem , in some situations to be arbitrary . if we made it 20 , the question would be why 20 year olds and not 19 . through the years society has determined that by 18 people should have attained enough life experience to form intent and to comprehend that their actions have consequences ( at least as it applies to the death penalty , they can be tried as adults w / o death ) . we do not execute people who can not comprehend the nature of their crimes and society says that , under 18 you can not fully comprehend criminal actions .	0
like most things in christianity as the catholic church got organized . <url> now why does that matter ? the burden of proof is yours to prove that god exists and the bible is his communication to man . you have made absolutely no progress towards that end . do not think my speculation on the evolution of the internal inconsistencies of christianity in any way substitutes for that responsibility .	0

no , i for one dislike your posts because i know you intentionally write irrational posts to help support your religious cause . just for the record montalban , basically every single legitimate scientist is " pro - evolution " . creation theory is not taught in public schools , not by chance , but because . <repeated> gasp <emphasis> it ' s <allcaps> religious mumbo jumbo </allcaps> . there is no evidence to support it . creation fiction has made no progress with it ' s " faith - based " ( lackofevidence ) with rational people . and i will also say that i ' d welcome ad hominem over irrational thinking any day . ad hominem is just a lack of patience , or someone who does not care to hide their emotion or opinion . irrational thinking on the other hand is often only cured by death . someone guilty of ad hominem can still hold a rational debate . the irrational . <repeated> well , why bother ? - mach	1
because ? the conventional big bang is just as unlikely as god . therefore your claim is wrong . however the current believe mainly among physicists and astronomers is that there is no end and there is no beginning to the universe . expansionary theories along with contractionary theories that are being observed have led many to believe that the current universe was born from the death of the last universe . there is no end and there is no beginning . you are out of your league .	0
but a slightly larger brain than average is still feasible and offers enough of a benefit in a large social group that its worth the price - however something the size of a modern humans brain is far too demanding . that slightly larger brain can be supported by an organism or society that has not developed fire , but is also able to discover the uses of it , from then on nutrician is not the big limiting factor that restricts how big a brain can get from then on .	0

because the men who wrote it mixed their mythology in with their heros . the first 11 chapters of genesis are obviously mythology . and if what you say is true , then i guess that means that the illiad is historical . why would homer be right about some lives and events , but wrong about others ? and of course , there are other parts of the bible that are pure fiction - jonah and job for example .	0

what does that have to do with the issue being discussed ? unless you are suggesting that for gays to refer to themselves as ethmi did is an expression of self loathing . is that the point you are trying to make ? beside , by presenting a film with dick gephart and gene robinson as examples of god fearing christians , you immediately expose yourself as someone who has no concept of what a true believer in christ is . so why should a film that is nothing more than secular humanist propaganda be taken seriously at all ?	0
so what you are saying is that you can not ? as a political move to satisfy the pro - life constituents that put them in office .	0
you contradict yourself . if the earth was then much as it is today , then there is not enough water on earth to cover it in any fashion . i have done the math . do you have any idea of how high the himalayas , the alps , the andes , and the rockies are ? besides , the bible talks about a flood that lasted a year , not a series of tsunamis .	0
then why does god order the killing of the unborn in the womb in hosea 13:16 . what did they ever do to god ? does god fear these people so much he has to have unborn members of their community killed . un born members who could not have possibly done anything to god !	1
that ' s a real laugh , coming from someone with so little knowledge of the legal and justice systems as you . do you even know what goes into obtaining a search warrant ? do you know what the limitations are regarding the scope of a search warrant and how it has to be narrowly tailored to something specific and nothing else ? right . and it was ca law that lead to a father ' s children being murdered because he thought he was obligated to keep his guns locked up at all time , making them inaccessible even in a true life or death emergency . it was also california law that proved just how registration can , does and will , lead to confiscation . they proved our case for us and showed everyone that we were not paranoid , and instead knew exactly what we were talking about .	0
no you can prevent the life of the unborn because they are not living but i do not think you should end the life of the born .	0
so why should you care about their non - scientific beliefs in a debate on science ? most people who believe in evolution do so because of science , so their non - scientific beliefs are irrelevant .	0

poet i found it interesting your illutration of the ' matirx ' series . i too have seen the two episodes and found it filled with religious overtones . i dont know the faith of the wachaski brothers but there story is intreging . all mankind decived by this lifstyle which as seen from reality is merely a save to produce power . much like mankind is decived by satan today . a select group of people who believe that a savior wil come to free man kind from this savery . even those who have seen the truth and reject it . this sounds alot like the account of the bible . i want so much to see the final episode to find if the theme continues . will neo ' s death be that which saves all mankind ? we will wait and see .	1

was that so hard ? anti gay christians do want gays to oppose their , marriages , discriminate against them , oppose christians from being able to adopt , and practice thier religion . since anti gay christians are doing all these things to gay people then that is how they want gay people to treat christians .	1
even with tax deductible status , i seriously doubt there ' s enough of a market available yet to make privatization a going concern . since all people will ostensibly benefit from whatever flows from the space program , it seems like government is still the only option now . sure , the russians are capitalizing on their experience by taking citizens for rides , but what are they really learning or advancing there ? they are getting more and more vocal about us funding their stupid space station . the europeans are primarily interested in the lucrative satellite - launching business ; again , where ' s the hard science ? so it seems to fall to the americans - - surprise . but if we do not do it , the chinese certainly will . in all probabilities , they will be fierce competitors , imo .	0
because africa is not one big homogeneous ecosystem . there are jungles , plains , deserts , swamps . himps living in the jungle were not in competition with himps that started migrating out onto the plains . their food sources are different , their territories are different . the more suited to plains - dwelling we became , the less attractive a prospect it was to return to the jungle . pretty straightforward , really .	0

well for one thing religion is specificly mentioned in the constitution , not as 100% protected but in that gov ' t cannot mandate a religion . also , religion is not unilateraly protected , as i have stated several times . there are many restrictions put on religion by government and if government can restrict religion then why not which marriages they recognise ? that being said i have long been a supporter of limited gov ' t and believe that gov ' t has no business endorsing or giving advantages to any marriage . they should be silent on the subject .	0

well , first , those were hebrews , not christians . secondly , the scripture does not say they raped them , it says " keep them for yourselves .

you mean pascals sucker bet ? if arch is wrong , he ' s wasted a good portion of his life and income catering to a false priesthood , a tick suckling off the fat and meat and marrow of their ' flocks ' . he ' s prevented himself from exploring the wonderful opprotunities this limited life has to offer for the nebulous promises that come after death is assured . furthermore , he ' s extolling others to do so also . because misery needs company to justify itself and in insecurity over the rediculous beliefs they hold , they need numbers to validate their wastes and servitude .	1
amusing coming from someone who falsely claimed another user misused the term " light year . " if i am so ignorant , explain how your argument does not require exactly what i said : that god operated the named light sources on a very different set of physical laws and removed all evidence of their existence to meld them with the current set of physical laws that we know do not support young earth creationism . i am betting you do not even understand your original argument . prove me wrong . explain how it does not result in god being a liar .	1
no i am not kronus . i have not made excuses for him or denied what he did . op said he is a conservative christian which is a lie and i am exposing that lie for what it is . unless she can prove he is anything more than a conservative secular republican , then he is no more a morally responsible person than an atheistic democrat . to attempt to mark all fundamental christians with the actions of this guy because he ' s a republican is a truly fallacious argument and a slanderous lie regarding me and all believers . none of this excuses what vitter himself is responsible for doing . but she is wrong for immorally attempting to paint us all as adulterers because of his sin .	0

well , if they have re - established control in new orleans ( and it seems they have ) , then taking a gun away from someone carrying it on the street would be what the police normally do in any city . if they were taking it away from peoples ' homes , and not letting them keep them , that would be over and above what they normally do . ( i am very pro - 2 nd amendment , so do not get me wrong here . i am just pointing out that taking guns away from people happens in every city every day ) i also think that it ' s kind of disingenuous to complain about the military coming in - - just a week ago everyone was criticizing the govt . for <allcaps> not </allcaps> sending in the military . now people are criticizing them for doing it ? <repeated>	0

actually , what gay marriage proponents simply want is to be treated like every one else . denying the right to marriage because of his / her sexual orientation makes them second class citizens . the supporters of the anti - gay movement simply want to impose their moral values on to the rest of the public , the recent prop 8 ballot initiative proves it . ever read john locke or js mill ? you should , it ' s what our country ideals are based on . you have your bubble and i have mine so just leave me alone ; and the majority are never always right and should not have a say in what is moral or just based on their beliefs .	0

those cultures that permit multiple wives at least do have issues as a result , but hard to say they fail miserably . we are complex animals and not all animals mate for life . there is significantly more involved in the lifelong union of humans than reproduction . multi - marry under the right circumstances works , but it is not for everybody and even for those that it is for does not mean it ' s for them always . in a nutshell marriage is the biggest commitment any person will make and should be given the consideration and thought it deserves . same sex marriage can cause a perfect union of two people the same as m / f and can make a mockery or marriage just as many m / f unions currently do . the emotional investment is the same , the responsibility and obligations are the same , the only difference is genitalia and a little more hair in some cases .	0

yea . <repeated> i ' d say we are on a downhill slide . do you agree with talkorigins that most mutations ( like 99% ) lose information , lose specificity ? mutations are destructive entities . they demolish and break down what was there . granted some of these may be beneficial but ulitmately the gene has lost information . and since selection works on the level of the whole organism , it cannot stop the loss of information on the molecular level . not only that , but natural selection has an i . q . of exactly zero - - as do random mutations - - so i believe the only way for the genome to go is downward . and if the only way for the genome to go is downward , then common sense says that neodarwinism is wrong . it ' s not just unlikely . <repeated> it ' s not just improbably - - it ' s dead wrong and the whole hypothesis must be rejected .	0
we are legally dead when we no longer mentally exist ( hence the term " brain - dead " ) , so there is no logical reason to set the beginning point as anything other than the start of the mental existence . just as people who are dead and without mental existence do not have the ability to obtain rights , a collection of human cells without a mental existence cannot obtain rights . i also notice you have resorted to attacking other people ' s views rather than following the topic of the thread , which is to share <allcaps> your </allcaps> views . emoticonxbanghead	0

two answers : they were either of the ant kind and did not eat wood until they underwent hyperevolution after the landing of the ark , or they were placed in a suspended state of hibernation by ' awlmighty gawd ' ( only two - one male and one female , in spite of the fact that termites do not actually propagate that way ) . it is , after all , the word of gawd , as revealed in the wholly babble .	1
oh yes i forgot there are some who believe that the property of free - will permeates the universe and is shared by all things animate or otherwise . there is a mathematical proof floating around someplace of it . but since i do not think that there is in fact such thing as free - will i have not bothered to collect it . humans do not have free - will simply because there is nothing for human will to be free of .	0
i am a bit surprised at the publicity this case has attracted : even here in the uk , the first item on the 10 o ' clock tv news last night was a report from outside the court house ( waiting for the verdict ) . i have never heard jackson sing and know next to nothing about his career - why has this case made such a stir in the media ? is it just a fascination with ' celebrity ' ?	0
reckon you do not know much about christianity then . when you can bust the resurrection of jesus christ then you might have something to argue about . until then your claim that christianity is untrue is simply a lot of hot air .	0
they are both written in the bible . neither of them have any evidence ( apart from the bible ) to support their existence . one of them has been proven to be utterly false . this naturally discredits the other , as they appear in the same publication by the same author . why decide one is true when the other is clearly not , and neither have any other supporting evidence ?	0
23,000 firearms were handed in when the uk had its gun ban . according to your logic those people that handed in their firearms can still be prosecuted because they took possession of a firearm prior to the ban . i do not think so .	0

i do not understand this business of the uk and england at all . it seems to me that somebody has a chip on their shoulder . who cares ? chomsky is not as bad as the terrorists . that ' s an obvious fact . what is equally obvious is that he provides aid and comfort to the enemy and that ' s the definition of a traitor .	0

so . <repeated> what was all that bull * * * * about terrorists exploiting america ' s " weak gun control laws " in order to amass arsenals of deadly weapons ? it seems to me that they do not need undercover operatives to come to america , forge documents and undergo background checks just to get civilian weapons . they have got their own arms manufacturing plants over there , they can make whatever they need or want .	0
but people start threads here all the time against christianity regardless of whether someone claims something here about it or not . it ' s prejudice , pure and simple , and you are no exception . now , one would think , being the supposedly non - christian enlightened person you are , you would simply say " oh , i did not realize that my posts came across as anti - christian sometimes , and that it indicates a prejudice on my part , and will try to not have prejudices in my thinking . " i mean , one would think those of you are do this sort of thing would be happy that someone had pointed out the obvious prejudice going on , as it would be a case to help you move away from prejudicial thinking .	0
so everyone thinks that " evolutionists " should seize power or something ? if that is true , it is because evolution is very widely accepted .	0
wrong again daewoo ; but at least you are painfully consistent . i am merely pointing out the hypocrisy and level of ignorance obama displays every time he opens his economically clueless and divisive mouth . but then , who would ever accuse you of getting anything right ? once again , the buffet rule is for the gullible and clueless to glom onto in a vacuum of reality and the fact that it would do nothing to solve this nations problems and is merely a diversion from the massive failure this president has been , more so than even carter . i cant say i am surprised you would glom onto such an idiot talking point . it is only strange for someone who is so completely clueless that they cannot even comprehend a simple thread premise . so were you born this clueless , or deliberately play the role of someone who is patently clueless ?	1

yes , you do have a problem with archaeopteryx . you can not explain it from a creationist point of view . i am not claiming that it is a " link , " whatever that may be . it is a transitional form . it is a small theropod dinosaur that has characteristics that are common to theropod dinosaurs and only theropod dinosaurs and their ancestors . it also has characteristics that exist in birds and only birds . some characteristics exist in both . the furcula , for example . a furcula has been identified in some theropods , but it is rather rare and then only imprefectly preserved . an indication that it may be mostly connective tissue . archaeopteryx has a furcula . but even at that it does not compare to the same structure in birds . it is intermediate . imagine that !	0

but it , along with the uranian tapeworm hypothesis , is just as valid as intellegent design as a hypothesis . actually , the uranian tapeworm hypothesis , . as far fetched as it may be , is more testable than a supernatural designer . i think maybe the kids <allcaps> should </allcaps> be taught intellegent design as an example of pseudo - science . hopefully they will see why it is not science and why evolutionary theory is .	0

no your question is not about ' right to life ' , but more appropriate your questioned should be ' do they have a right to continue life ' ? and my answer is absolutely yes ! at the living single cell , when the unique properties of a complete human being is created , it is living , not dead . who has a right to kill another human being ' s living existance ? no one has that right in a civil society , but we have not reached that society yet , but one day maybe .	0

ha wouldnt you say someone who is really overweight actually has more of a problem with stress on their joints , muscels , heart , and bladder than a woman carrying a small child in her womb ? obesity can demand major scarifices in behavior and diet . some of which can be detrimental . i really dont see your point because this isnt just a woman ' s problem when it comes to these issues you pointed out . and im not really sure what a " pregnancy " is according to you . <repeated> please explain . <repeated> when i hear the word pregnant , i think of 2 people , not just 1 . also , the baby has its own blood , its own immune system , and contains its own calories once consumed . theres nothing that the mother has that the baby doesnt other than it just needs nutrtion . just like you need food everyday .	0

socialism is a very broad category of political ideals , which particular form were you thinking of ? and just so you know , fascism is not a form of socialism in any way . socialism does not have oppressive governments . the purpose of socialism is to remove the class differences in society , if there is a small group of bureaucrats enforcing their will on the workers then that ' s a class difference .	0
people have entertained and will always continue to entertain beliefs in all manner of propositions . many people once believed that the earth is flat : perhaps some still do . but this has nothing to do with scientific truth . there is no " version " of science that one chooses from a menu of possibilities . by definition , scientific enquiry arrives at hypotheses after gathering evidence from observations and experiment . any law , knowledge , etc . thatis arrived at by scientific method is open to modification or falsification if new evidence comes to light that must be taken into account . all science in this sense is provisional . the apostles may have believed that jesus walked on water : that does notmake it true .	0

that is an utter contradiction . he knows what is going to happen , but wants to preserve our freedom of choice ? what freedom ? please , explain so i can understand , this ' freedom ' which gives rise to only one possible future ! the existence of a god who can see the future implies we have no choice in shaping our destiny . no ifs , buts or maybes . this is not about god deciding our future , it ' s about whether we can . well , that ' s one interpretation . another would be ' not sticking our heads in the sand ' .	1
i never said anything about a conspiracy peeling . i very clearly gave valid reasons to consider that scientific <allcaps> grants </allcaps> and pay increases for these scientists are based on making new and previously undiscovered claims that forward the science . that is the greatest motivation to lie , cheat , create and falsify evidence which adds to the scientists personal wealth and further promotes a false science that is rife with selfish motivations to preserve , protect and promote it .	0

yup . give me an example of a true inaccuracy , instead of working to poke fun . do you honestly think anyone will take you seriously ( except the evolutionists ) if you do not provide reasons for your apparent problem with scriptures . are you scared because you see the " ancients " commenting on subjects you thought science had " discovered " since the " enlightenment " ? man , how arrogant can you get ? you remind me of the pharasees . arrogant presuppositions are no substitue for confronting your ignorance my friend . either explain how the bible speaks accurately on sophisticated subjects as given above , or do not bother posting .	1
well actually i have not seen your point of view expressed anywhere but on these forums . seems to me if its rising to ascendancy at least <allcaps> one </allcaps> scientist somewhere would have recently at least mentioned it . quick search reveals no mentions at all . of course if you say its displacing <allcaps> nds </allcaps> then i guess i will have to agree - you being a well known biologist and all , but i remain perhaps a bit irrationaly skeptical .	1

1 ) why is the philosophy of jefferson twisted ? <repeated> if you can not say its because you are a typical anti american liberal . 2 ) nothing to suppoprt it ? if anti - american liberal positions were made illegal as per the constitution then everyone would have to vote among the conservatives . the political spectrum would simple shift so that both extremes were in the intelligent range . on the far left you ' d have romney and on the far right you ' d have ron paul . now that would be an intelligent election consistent with our very very conservative constitution .	1
i think you are missing the point . why would you want to keep people under control ? to prevent them from harming other people . the men who created the commandments and the bible i believe had good intentions . they wanted to give people a reason to live their lives well , and the bible was the best and most intelligent thinking of the time ( not modern , ancient ) . it was a good idea , however people started looking past the ' love thy neighbor ' stuff and started focusing on unimportant things like homosexuality and abortion . so , my question is why is homosexuality a sin ?	0

. <repeated> and half right . preventing something that has been predicted does not create a paradox . your logic is severely flawed here . i am somewhat surprised by that . if i predict that georgia tech will win the peach bowl and lsu comes up and prevents that , i still predicted it . i was just wrong . you are attaching something supernatural to nostradamus as if he really had some power to accurately predict the future . he made some lucky guesses . <repeated> that ' s all . sometimes , the local fortune cookies are right , too . sometimes the horoscopes seem to fit . that does not mean that the writer ' s actually knew anything about their future readers .	0
pay attention to what ? to the voices in your head ? your age is irrelevant to your recognized lack of intelligence , but being a minor would be relevant since it would excuse your ignorance . my advice to you ? keep all your life pretending in forums that you are just a kindergarten kid and therefore people would think that for a 4 year old kid you are not too dumb and of course knowing nothing is understandable .	1
umm , do not know about you but i also eject waste through my penis - just do not do it when having sex , just not polite ( unless they ask , now there ' s another fetish i do not get ) . is not it odd if the anus was not designed for a penis its still pleasurable ?	1

you have to be kidding me . you do not really believe this , do you ? <repeated> sure they may have white people on from time to time , but obviously they exclude white people since you can turn it on and almost always see only black people . so the criteria of whether something is racist or not is whether or not there is a ' single culture ' behind it ? i do not see why having a culture behind it is really relevant . things can be racist or not independent of whether there is a culture there .	0
ill be the first to agree with the saying " if you can . <repeated> and have the place to . <repeated> you will " but like anything else . <repeated> you have to look at the better side of things . <repeated> it would act like a deterant to allow our responsable citizens to be armed . <repeated> yes perhaps what you said might take place . <repeated> but the benefits would outway them . <repeated> and thats all we can ask for in life . as for our irresponsable citizens . <repeated> they are already armed .	0
on an internet forum why is that so important ? the bigger man usually need not find it necessary to prove he is , but is secure in his knowledge he is or is big enough to realize when he is not and adjust accordingly . my guess is this is not the only place this happens . these things happen , you fall , you get up , people laugh , you move on , you see someone fall you can laugh or help them up . just depends on who you want to be . sorry i am a sucker for empty milk crates . can not seem to walk by one without jumping on and taking her for a spin .	0

[ <allcaps> quote </allcaps> = gnojek ] if a child grew up never hearing the words religion , gods , spirits , etc . would this child still have faith of some sort ? is faith some innate human tendency ? it could be seeing as how there is the " god spot " in the brain , but maybe the god spot would not develop as fully in the child that was never exposed to religion or thoughts of the supernatural . <allcaps> quote </allcaps> ] look around . faith did not spontaneously generate out of thin air . it is obviously part of our psyche . every civilization throughout history has felt the need for some type of faith . even on different sides of the planet . it ' s as natural as the sun rising .	0

for someone who puts importance on the ability to think i am surprised that you believe mentally handicapped people are as valuable as the average person . value is of course the key word here . value can be interpreted to mean many different things including value to the human society . even the humanistic perspective has to take into account that the human society as a whole even if it is only a small portion . i do not think the handicapped can hold a great deal of value in the human society when compared to the avereage ' intelligent and able - bodied humans ' , would not you agree ? if so then where do they make up for this imperfection to increase their ' value ' to be equal to that of an able - bodied human ?	0

actually , the answer might depend more on the nature of the question , or the particular religious cult of the person being asked , etc . in questions of science , fundamentalists will tell you that the answer was revealed to them by their god in their holy scripture . on the other hand , you are characterizing religion as insanity . i think that you really mean that when religion is offered as science , then that is insane .	0

that ' s <allcaps> not </allcaps> the equivalent of id - you are mixing causes & effects . the theory of evolution , and the theory of intelligent design would equally observe , measure , and publish the effects of the apple falling . then the evolutionists would say that happenstance origins caused gravity to work that way , and id proponents would say that a supernatural design caused gravity to work that way . students should not have it implied to them that happenstance origins are the only possible cause of gravitational behavior . your " apple falling " scenario is a simple one - the original cause of gravity has practically no impact on how we observe and deal with it ' s effects . other scientific subjects are not that simple .	0

well , since we are talking about a gay man , i would guess it would most likely be masculine . yeah , you are being kinda homophobic . why would you possibly care if a gay man sees you in the shower ? they are not going to do anything to you . if you treat someone differently for no reason other then the fact that they are gay , that ' s homophobia . gays are just like everyone else , excpect they are sexually attracted to the same gender . their interests cover the same spectrum as yours , sex aside . they are just as likely to be masculine or feminine as a straight man . gays are , in everyway outside of sexual preference , just like straights . so while you can certainly be selective about who your friends are , if you write someone off just for being gay that would be a shame , and a sign of prejudice .	0

so you have gone from evolution and id to cosmology . you have a real problem with maintaining established realms . id addresses evolutionary theory , not abiogenesis , and not cosmology .	0
well , in the case above , it was step - by - step . first , an existing enzyme was modified to a new use , and over time , became refined to work better and better . this is the way evolution works . nothing is de novo ; it ' s always a modfication of something else . second , a mutation produced a regulator that only allowed the enzyme to be produced if the substrate was available . again , this was refined by natural selection over time . in the end , the newly - evolved system was irreducibly complex , because all three parts have to be present for the system to work . and do show us your numbers proving that such processes can not produce new information . if you do not know how , i ' d be pleased to show you how a mutation changes the information in a population .	0
and how does this differ from life insurance or car insurance ? or for credit cards , for that matter ? the cost of a policy , or card , is proportional to the risk assumed by the insurer . do not want to pay high premiums , take the risk on yourself . period . i find it morally unacceptable to steal money from people in order to satiate another ' s morality . we have no god - given right to live forever as far as i know .	0
where did you here this <allcaps> x <elongated> </allcaps> ? some cheap detective novel or something ? once again , my sincerest apologies .	1
being new is not a problem . nor is uncertainty about a position . the way to learn is to ask questions in appropriate places . however , a problem with message boards is that , without experience , it may be difficult to tell who is speaking from knowledge and who is speaking from ignorance or faith .	0
and what if it is one to me ? then your refute is equally refuted . the support for us not knowing lies in you and other ' s inability to provide anything beyond speculation as support for the assertion that an unborn child is not a person . your own inability is my support .	0

really ! then i assume that you have read darwin - at least on the origin of species . otherwise you are babbling . please cite specific passages from darwin ' s books where he made " morals and ethics " a joke . please also do the same for the works of dawkins . your assertion presumes that you have read the works of both men .	0
that ' s certainly your right , but supersport is interested in hawking a religious agenda , not a scientific one . he may want it disguised as a scientific one , but a perusal of his posts here bely that desire .	0

so theistic evolution is not a belief , not a faith at all ? it is simply a humanistic idea that is based on science , using god to fill gaps ?	1
economically it is great . heck , it would even be better if robots did all our jobs for us at almost no expense . sure the corporations would be fine with that because they would profit but what about the average person who cannot find a job ? sending jobs over seas does not hurt our economy but it does not help billy who lost his job to it . i am not suggesting that we stop outsourcing jobs but i am suggesting that while our jobless rate increases that our government do something to keep some jobs here .	0
you are equating atheism and homosexuality with terrorism and drug dealing ? really ? can you stop being a reactionary dolt long enough to convince me you are worth even trying to converse with ? if not , i will understand . <repeated> and not be surprised .	1
where is the government in this ? clinicians made a clinical decision , and hid behind a non - mandatory guideline , which was set by other more senior clinicians , expert in their field . assuming the woman ' s very detailed recall of the stressful series of events is accurate , perhaps it was god ' s way of telling this unmarried mother that after five previous miscarriages , she still wasn ' t getting the message .	1

persecution on political grounds ? we are talking about a kingpin of russian organized crime here . he has been indicted in russia for fraud and political corruption ( bribing politicians ) and there is absolutly no question that he is guilty as sin . now he is hiding in britain and actively planning a violent coup in order to overthrow the elected government . <repeated> and he lays all this out to a british newspaper . political persecution if he returns ? probably not . execution for treason ? that one seems more likely . in the extradition rhetoric arena , the russians are looking a lot more reasonable then the british .	0
you can take a horse to water . i provided evidence to support my assertion . you provided . <repeated> " oh no it is not ! "	1

the ' teachings ' either have no substance , or are certainly not original . demonstrate categorically just who is the son of god , and why this figure commands worship and obeisance .	0
right . and that is the reason for peer review . creationists do not subject their ramblings to peer review . that is why so much care is devoted to the proper construction of experiments to test the hypotheses by real scientists . creationists just invent ad hoc stories without any experimentation .	0
how exactly is terrorism not a criminal act ? i do not see what you are getting at .	0
well , i have heard people on the pro - gun side say that most defensive gun uses do not involve firing even one round . so limiting the capacity would probably have less of an effect on the ability to defend yourself than on crime . so why are people from the gun lobby always whining about restrictions like this ? when semi - automatic rifles were banned in australia , hunters welcomed the law . they saw it as a challenge because it takes greater skill to shoot an animal with a bolt action rifle . not so in america where some gun owners like to use guns that could take down planes to shoot small animals .	0
proving my beliefs from the bible is not being un - christian . is it ? as i said i do not want to debate it with you , i just like to know who i am typing to . simple .	0
yes , do you ? it ' s in a country with no medical facilities , no sterile place to get it done . a country full of <allcaps> hiv </allcaps> and <allcaps> aids </allcaps> . i would not be surprised if these mothers had <allcaps> hiv </allcaps> / <allcaps> aids </allcaps> and knew they ' d leave their child an orphan .	0
then for you , you made the right decision at the time . i ' d personally have been leary of not getting to work or go to school easily from the doctors statements , especially in regards to keeping the child .	0
you are right , why not simply kill these people in the shortest amount of time possible . i got it ! we can advertise each killing ( hanging , rock slaying , guillotine , etc . ) weeks in advance , kinda like moves , and show it on pay - per - view . you can buy tickets to watch the show live as well . i mean c ' mon , if we are going to have the death penalty we might as well utilize in the most gruesome , cost efficient , and swift method possible . right ? that is how punishment was executed a few centuries ago . honestly , how you feel is how a lot of people culturally conceive such offenders . in regards to the death penalty debate , it falls along a continuum between morality and scientific reasoning .	1
i just bet you thought you were smart just now ? i will go you several . <repeated> how about : 1 . murder2 . stealing3 . adultery4 . rapealmost every culture since the dawn of civilization has put to death those who have trespassed those basics . but i guess you did not get that on the recovery channel huh ? your idiocy is profound only as your ignorance .	1
i love how you are pro - choice until its a choice you do not like . let people carry guns in their own home . let them carry it on their person . it has nothing to do with you does it not ? unless you deal with people threatening you with guns on a daily basis it does not . their house <annoyed> = their choice , her body = her choice ? i love hypocrisy .	1
wow i did not know you were going to calculate that ! well its true i do earn a lot of points a day and join and participate in a lot of debates in a day . also my 2 nd year being here is coming up soon !	0
actually , you have slipped into talking bible here and seem to be refering to the miracle of lazarus .	0

oh , ok , i can be politically correct if it makes you feel better . how about i refer to them as " intelligence deficient " . and i was really not referring to bona fide " retarded " individuals ( those with true pathology ) . i agree that there is nothing funny about that . how about i refer to them as people who drive like <allcaps> x <elongated> </allcaps> . <repeated> is that better ?	1
so what ' s the deal when <allcaps> gwb </allcaps> " gives " $3,000 but the insurance premiums cost $6,000 , the family can not make up the difference and the $3,000 goes unspent . all we have accomplished is to transfer $ out of the u.s. treasury . you think it ' s a good idea to just give money away and not get anything for it ? you are thinking of the clinton years when there was a surplus .	0
i have always gone the scylla and charybdis route before instead .	0
in the old testament people were punished for the sins they committed . i think he ' s asking why should we punish people while they are living ? god will punish them when they die .	0
i am concerned with u . s . history . i ' d rather go back 200 years . i will see what i can find - out of time tonight however . is not the big bang part of evolution ? i do not notice atheist authors , or the aclu , using it in politics much . what else can influence morals ?	0
you are right justine . organized religion has always been used by some people as crutch in order to feel superior to others . why use your brain and heart if you do not have to ? because they are encouraged by their particular religion to behave this way , they think it ' s ' morally ' alright . ' sickening ' is a good way to put it .	1
well let us see . . . the last time a state started recognizing gay marriages , suddenly there was more support for a federal marriage amendment than ever , democrats lost more seats in congress , the minority democratic leader was defeated after years in office , a protestant presidential candidate carried the catholic vote against a catholic candidate , evangelicals in the country were energized , the pro - <allcaps> fma </allcaps> candidate <allcaps> won </allcaps> re - election even though his approval rating was 50% , and the state that recognized gay marriage fell under a slew of legal challenges to the point where it ' s up in the air again . the more you push you agenda through activist judges , the closer you get to the people having to pass an amendment . at least new york was smart enough not to do it right before an election .	0
actually , i find it near impossible to discuss the second amendment without gun control advocates bringing up the third argument . weak ? yes . rare ? no . in my opinion , all arguments in favor of gun control are weak .	0
yea i guess you are right , you people tend to blur together after a time .	1
so for example if i say " you are a part of my body , and therefore i have a right to kill you " , is this simply a matter of ideology ? i admit the distinction is not clearcut at early stages of development , but how do you support the idea that post - birth children are " a part " of their mothers ' bodies and therefore legitimate to kill ? it is no more legitimate to say that a fetus is a part of a woman ' s body than it is to say that a woman is a part of a fetus ' body . just as a woman is not a subordinate slave to the fetus within her , the fetus cannot be considered subordinate in rights to the woman it is inside .	0
tell me genius , how is me accurately and correctly pointing out your mistake colluding to misdirect anyone ? either you are again using words you do not know the meaning of to make such an inaccurate statement , or you are just lying . so which is it penfold , are you ignorant or just being dishonest again ? emoticonxconfused	1

so the intent hiding behind abortion laws all along was to keep women in the gutter . there was not any legititamte concern for the unborn fetus . it was all about how they could keep women down . tell me then , would someone who supports a ban on partial birth abortion do so simply because they want to repress women ?	0
you guys just do not get it do you ? this is not about an attack on christianity . this is not about anti - christians , and in the end , this is not about the cross , or any other religious symbol for that matter , offending anyone . this is about keeping religion from meddling with government , but just as , if not more , important , it is about keeping government from meddling with religion , and the moment they intertwine , there are possibilities for many dangerous things to happen . and by the way , i am a christian , and i do not want my government in any way defining any part of what i hold dear . p . s . sandycane - most buddhists are not in india .	0

so you are saying that the democrats have no choice but to inaugarate brown and let him stop the bill ? you suggest that whatever option they pick will be political suicide .	0
i do not see why not . if somebody is perfectly willing to murder you in cold blood despite your blind compliance i see no reason to believe that they ' d hesitate if it meant crushing a skull with a bat rather than just shooting them in the face . seriously , what kind of stability are you dealing with when all it takes to motivate someone to murder is a simple question ? a baseball bat is not concealable like a handgun , is it ? nor can it be readily used by someone suffering arthritis or used in a cramped location . any weapon can be used to inflict death and murder . the human body is hardly a modern marvel of resiliency and near - indestructibility . even sneezing wrong can be potentially fatal . certainly not . do you see a contradiction ?	1
i guess i ' d rather live among them , too , than have a hot poker shoved up my bottom .	1

so would you care if abortion were outlawed . if so , what would be bad about allowing a view that places objective value in human life to be the basis for making law ?	0
and what are the choices of the so called ' pro - life ' people ? suffer through a rape or incest induced pregnancy , die from pregnancy complications without a chance of terminating it , or force women who took proper precautions which failed to go through an unwanted pregnancy while likely losing her job , scholarships , any chance at life , etc . some great choices there emoticonxrolleyes i ' d swear the whole group of them have an underlying misogynistic syndrome .	1
how about you post all the " great amount " of evidence concerning the gospel mythology . the fact that you do not even bother to read the actual information and form an argument tells me you have nothing . <repeated>	1
let us say that the law , based upon some kind of verifiable scientific data , decides that some folks are inferior to other folks , and thus less of a person ? you know , if the law said ' because you are black , you are less of a person than shomeone who is white . you should not be upset though , all scientific data suggests that you , because you are black , are truly inferior to those who are white . ' would you think , because the law said so , that a black person was in fact a non - person ?	1

what the heck did you have for breakfast today , huh ? a bowl of nails and terpentine to wash it down ? talk about a foul mood . you have been to half a dozen threads just this morning launching personal attacks at everybody you come across , and most of them have something to do with ' i am glad there are not more people in the world like you , ' or ' i hope you are the only ones the terrorists kill so we can get back to making this nation great , ' blah blah blah . they invented things like midol for moods like yours . just because someone does not agree with you does not make them stupid , or misguided , or immoral , or dishonest , or any of the other snipes you have been firing off . lol , and you are telling me to not throw any hissy fits .	1
no . unless you wish to actually undertake the study of the relevant science , that ' s what you need to do . creationists do the same thing . the problem is that creationists tend to accept the word of those who are not any more educated than they are . thus , a creationist will accept hovind ' s dust on the moon argument or his shrinking sun argument as " proof " of a young earth .	0

obviously i do not have a perfect memory or even that i read what you are referring to . why do not you give me a flavor of their ' factual errors ?

this has nothing to do with my post . you do not need to believe in conspiracy theories to believe that the universe is pretty crazy . i am an advocate of science , and even i admit that , especially at the quantum level , shit gets crazy . particles being in two places at once , 95% of the universe being undetectable , whole separate universes colliding to make new ones . it ' s crazy yes , but it is also scientific . in fact , compared to science , the answers psychics provide are rather boring . i am impressed by the stuff i just listed , not some charlatan guessing whether or not i have a dog .	0
lol what part of a binding document , the constitution with it ' s bill of rights , do not you understand ! you demand that we obey the law , but you would allow government to break the supreme law of the land , and you call me a nut ? i gotta say my friend , <allcaps> that </allcaps> is truly nutty ! emoticonxsmilie	1

nice try , but no cigar . i never said that inflation had no effect . of course it does . but even factoring in the alleged 500% inflation since the 1 9 6 0 s or whatever it happens to be depending on calculation does not account for the huge run - up in the price of crude to nearly $80 not that long ago . my beef has been the resident " experts " here who flout their supposed knowledge and money to impress us lesser mortals who reminded them of the iron law of supply and demand . that , by the way , is found in economics 101 . but you knew that , did not you ? so now , it ' s a " technical " correction . what ' s next ? some wisdom from joe granville or the elliot wave theory ? ball in your court .	1

marriage is not a religious institution . it is a government contract nothing more . many people choose to have a religious ceremony to celebrate their marriage but that doesnt make it a religious institution . need proof ? you can get married without the permission of the church but you cant get married without the permission of the government . and because marriage is a government institution then they cannot discriminate against same sex couples and must provide the same benefits to them as is provided to straight couples . and it cannot be a separate institution either because separate is not equal . but as i have already said this shouldnt be up for a vote . civil rights never should be .	0

i have been around the creationist / science discussions for a number of years , about 20 or so . the " you believe in evolution " argument has been around for at least that long . in my experience it has been a waste of breath to try to convince creationists that i do not believe in evolution any more than they do . as i recall , the argument was even presented in a court case back in the late 6 0 s , or maybe it was the early 8 0 s . i could be wrong . i will have to check on that .	0

well , " reasonable " is clearly subjective . <repeated> so the authors of the letter are practicly saying that any gun laws not interfering with the state militia would be permited according to the second amendment . but that gun laws obviously should be reasonable . but what reasonable is , is best left to the democratic will of the people . or am i reading it wrong ?	0

theres no scientific studies that disproves nor supports them . so i guess yes , its 50 / 50 so more or less half of these are likely to exist right ? every imaginary thing that i could make up , half of that is probable to existing if they all can not be proven or disproven ?	0

the quality of life ethic is far different from sactity / dignity of life ethic . a quality of life ethic carried out to its logical conclusions does not promote a pro - life society . instead , there would be genocide against the handicapped , elderly , and people who people of power have deemed life unworthy of life . the problem with this ethic is that it is centered in arbritrary people deciding arbritarily which person passes the " quality of life " test .	0

well , i do not believe in evolution . i believe in things for which i have no evidence . and while it is true that everyone has bias , using correct science and the process of peer review works to eliminate . not all is perfect , and people are people , but overall the system works . not a lot of bad science gets through . in the case of " creation science " we know that there is no science involved . only talk that sounds scientific . there is no hypothesis , prediction or testing . only ad hoc stories constructed of selected bits of evidence to support the foregone conclusion .	0

since when were proteins no longer structures ? a basic freshmen tool for teaching is the phrase " structure defines function . "	0
" ready to go " , in the sense that living things are equipped with a means of making small errors which are used by natural selection to make new structures . barbarian , regarding mutations : there is a lot of that . many mutations are recessive and a population over time accumulates a lot of genetic variation that can become useful if the environment changes . the founder population of lizards , for example , could have had at most , 20 alleles for any gene locus , since each lizard can only have 2 . the new ones evolved by mutation . sometimes , we can even observe that happening , or trace the mutation back to a known ancestor . would you like to learn about it ? .	0

yes . it describes an action without ascribing its form to its end result , outcome , whatever but strictly to a cause / s force / s in action . that is why ' selection ' is always teleological . in order to select or choose anything , an end must always be in view . there must always be a volitional discrimination of options based upon a criterion dictated by the desired end . the only time " channel " becomes teleological is when something live [ a human or a beaver , let us say ] intententionally does the channeling . but since it is understood that mechanical forces can also ' channel ' , unintentional , out of simple mechanics , the word channel cannot be called teleological . in the same way , ' sorting ' can be considered non - teleological , hence mechanical , and thus suited to your glossary , because things can be sorted by mechanical forces alone . but ' selection ' always requires volition and awareness . so ' selection ' is always teleological .	0

thanks for that , jason . in esdraelon ' s defense , there are hundreds of authors of other religions who choose to take portions of our writ out of context , and morph them into something that looks like what he described . ( a self - made god who has an alotted portion of the universe . ) this is not the actual belief of lds . this is a skewed and exaggerated oversimplification of our doctrine of eternal progression . it ' s also what seems to be most commonly understood when an lds tries to briefly explain the doctrine . in other words , i am not surprised that esdraelon was under that impression .	0
there is just one thing however . the coelacanths found are different from those in the fossil record . further , <allcaps> all </allcaps> evidence pointed to them being extinct , until we found other evidence , and we changed it . and , to top it off , the article says <allcaps> nearly </allcaps> extinct , not <allcaps> completely </allcaps> . although , this article was of course written after the coelocanths were re - discovered . of course , this has absolutely nothing to do with the theory of evolution , which explains the mechanisms responsible for the change of allele frequencies in populations over time .	0
' if it ' s beside the point ' the why bring it up , jyoshu . why ' talk out of both sides of your mouth ' ? and your right wing talking points are stale and tired . comparing different civil rights movements is not ' piggybacking ' . and incidentally , why is it that all of the blacks in congress for equal rights for glbt people ? why is it that they are the most passionate defenders of glbt people ? there are black gay people who suffered along with the straight black people . there are female gay people that suffered along with the women . on top of such discrimination , gay people may have had no family support . some were probably lobotomized against their wishes . some were raped , some were probably murdered by people they thought would understand what discrimination was all about . no , my friend . it is disingenuous to say with certainty that you know they have not .	0

so according to one of the people who conducted the study do not go using their results as a tool for arguing against abortion . one woman i know had an abortion a short time after she was married . i also know she has regrets that she had the procedure . i considered what she had to say about her experience and thought about the 14 year old son she now has . from what she told me , i could plainly see she would never have had her son if she had not had her abortion as her circumstances would have changed beyond recognition . perhaps she gets depressed about the child she never had because of her abortion . however , her son is a fantastic boy whom she loves very much . so we cannot simplify in quite the way you seem to infer that we can .	0

maybe firstly you should explain how god works ? in what way does he manupilate matter in defience of the laws of physics , where does he dwell , how can we not observe such a being ? and all the other questions of the supernatural . the theory of a god is actually a lot , lot more complicated than evolution as you have to explain how <emphasis> god works to get even basic science points .	0

if genesis in the bible is not a literal account of creation ( i , e . , six days , man from dust , fruit of good and evil ) then what is its use ? why include as the foundation of the entire bible a story that is either totally fabricated , or mostly inaccurate / metaphorical ? genesis 1 & 2 , in the literal application , has 2 vitally important concepts that the entire bible is totally useless without : 1 . god is sovereign and totally limitless in power 2 . man has disobeyed god and is in need of reconciliation everything else in the entire bible rests on these 2 premises . now if genesis has it wrong , then what is the use of any of the rest of the bible ? from all scientific perspective , genesis 1 & 2 never happened , and here the validity of the entire bible is questioned .	0

i asked on another thread , but it fits here as well . <repeated> is there a distinction between the absence of belief in x and the belief in the absence of x ? before , i suggested that i could not see a distinction , but after pondering it for awhile , i believe there is a distinction between the two : if one asserts that there is no god ( or gods ) , this is a belief in the absence of god . if one makes no assertions one way or another ( even internally ) , then this would be an absence of belief . i am not certain into which ' side ' atheism would fall , though i believe it would have to be the former , and therefore , a belief . the latter sounds more like agnosticism to me . but perhaps someone else can better clarify this topic .	0

marriage is a secular condition set up by various societies over the millenia and one of the prerequisites set out is that such a union should be between people of different genders . religion has supported this and sanctified it but did not invent it . you do not curse the church you lobby society to see if you can effect a change . people who believe the different gender aspect are entitled to lobby for no change .	0

i will address the later question . they may not " need " teeth that big , i could not say . just because a creature has a feature does not mean its necessary or useful . while evolution does select for useful traits and against harmful traits , that does not mean that a trait will not develop that is simply odd . as long as it is not particularly negative there ' s no reason to assume it will go away , and so sometimes you get traits that are not " useful " , they are simply not harmful . those teeth could be such a case .	0
well said . most americans favor more gun control , but unfortunately this majority of americans tends not to vote based on the issue of gun control while a very vocal minority composed of gun activists definitely does vote based on the issue . this is something politicians have realized since 1994 so they have been more hesitant to support gun control . there probably will be more gun control supporters in office in the coming years but i am not sure how much this will change things .	0

if reality conflicts with the bible , there are people that tend to ' reinterpret ' the bible so that to them it agrees with reality . this is inexcusable in my opinion . to me , the very fact that they convince themselves that the bible says something it doesnt is worse than simply admitting that the bible contradicts reality . what is the point of depending on the bible for truth when youre going to interpret it to suit something entirely contrary ? its like telling your kids that the moon is made of cheese , and then later when confronted with contradictory evidence , rather than admit you lied , you tell your kids that they misinterpreted what you said .	1
i do appreciate your point while i disagree on principle . i guess it boils down to the fact that even if i believed in a god i could not accept that he would command us to suppress our true innate nature . why would he makes us that way and then expect such a thing ? christians especially are indoctrinated from early on with the notion that that is exactly what god commands . to suppress a good many natural inclinations . to accept that we are sinful by nature and need to be punished , our nature brought to heel .	0

and we know this how ? you complain about the 90% figure being erroneous and then make an unsupported statement like this ? furthermore , if mexico is making an earnest attempt to smash the cartels and we are financing it in part , would not we want to help reduce the weapons traffic flowing south into the cartel ' s arsenals ?	0

true , but what i was trying to state is that the bible has little to do with christianity if you dont believe in it . i know many christians who believe in god , and jesus etc , but think the bible is completely false , and is only a book of fables . thats what i was trying to imply .	0
so every woman who has an abortion lives an irresponsible life . care to give any examples , or are you just spouting rubbish with no experience or knowledge whatsoever ?	0
i know that . evolution releases itself from its foundation at will . when it wants to speculate about things like abiogenesis and claim it to be science , it allows itself to do that . it ' s that interchangeability thing you spoke of above .	1
if that were true , why are there millions of miscarriages each year ? i do not believe a word of it .	0
i think more than this is the principle of human dignity . that humans have inherent dignity and value at every stage of life . this is transcendent of whether they are conscious or unconscious and it is why we treat 24 week premies who have no real conscious existence and a 30 year old automobile accident victim in a coma on a respirator and you and me the same . so strongly do humans recognize this inherent dignity that even in death a person is dignified with a funeral ceremony recognizing their life had inherent meaning and value . we build memorials to those who were victimized in life .	0
except several rligious organizations around the country have financed , and gathered signatures to put anti gay marriage amendments on the ballot . they have a religious belief that marriage is between one man and one woman . they have turned this belief into law regaurdless of the religious beliefs of gay people . any one who has voted yes to place these amendments into state constitutions because they have a religious belief that excludes gay people from marriage has also imposed those religious beliefs upon gay people . in short i have been barred from marrying the person i love because someone else , that i do not know and who does not know me , has some sick religious belief .	0
oh yes , mr behe makes a comfortable living out of selling to the ignorant . his newest book is just a rehash of his old book , and has the very same flaws that have been destroyed over and over again . as for your ' religious authors ' being respected . <repeated> they are respected perhaps by the fundamentalists that do not understand what science is about .	1

oh yeahrubbish rubbish , scientifically speaking , human life ( using a most bsic term ) begins at conception . the twins exist as two seperate entities the moment each contains the individual human dna . seems to me you better be certain when it begins before you go around ending it . if you are driving at night an you " think " you might see a person ahead in the middle of the road you are hopefully not gonna drive over that person . instead that uncertainty should lead you to stop . if you dont like that example , consider a hunter who is unsure what is in the bushes .	0
this is a very simple , easily answerable question . most people , especially in america , have problems with people telling them what to do . teenagers hate being under the authority of adults . adults hate being under the authority of the government and enforcers of the law . everyone in the world is under worldly authority , but to actually have a god who created you , which gives him the right to make commandments stating what is good for you and what is not , that makes most people really <allcaps> x <elongated> </allcaps> off .	0

i will agree science has disproven the literal reading of a number of different scriptures , such as the literal reading of genesis ( which was never meant to be literal to begin with , but that is a different matter ) . it also might explain why spiritiual beliefs exist for people . however , when it comes to this vaguly defined entity that alledgely created the universe , science has nothing to say about the existance of this alledged supernatural being .	0

third degree ? dono posted something that confused me , so i was asking for clarification . of what concern is it to anyone whether gay people marry ? adopt ? what concern is it of mine whether female infants have their vaginas sewn up , for that matter ? why should anyone care whether women have abortions , as well ? again , where is the line drawn between concern over an issue and obsession ? yay for you ? there were black people who thought slavery was just fine , too , so i see this as evidence of nothing more than your own muddy thinking .	0

nope . frame - shifts move the whole code down one step , making entirely new genes . often , this is disastrous , but sometimes , a useful new enzyme results . barbarian observes : it ' s remarkable then , how much progress we have made . you may or may not approve of the theory , but it works very well at learning more about biology . and , as you may have noticed , we have been very successful at interpreting the data . we have learned to do a lot of things as a result . one of the most important reasons scientists accept the theory is that it works .	0

i think the only valid reason for owning a gun is because you want to . every person ( with some exceptions ) has the right to keep and bear arms , why you do it is your own business . giving specific reasons for gun ownership is the top of a slippery slope towards banning certain firearms . while i have specific reasons for owning specific guns , to include hunting , i own some of my guns for no other reason than they are fun to shoot . a humorus side note : i own one gun strictly for fishing , sounds odd but its common practice ( at least in alaska ) to shoot large halibut before bringing them aboard .	0

well , yes . eleven years is quite swift , but it actually supports the theory of evolution through natural selection . the estimates of the speed of evolution that you seem to be depending on were done by george gaylord simpson way back in the 1 9 4 0 s or 1 9 5 0 s . since then , we have observed fruit flies , as well as other specimens , to evolve quite rapidly , showing significant evolution in only a decade or so . more recently , however , scientists have been able to observe evolution in natural settings and have found that it can sometimes be quite rapid when environmental change is rapid . besides the studies that reznick did on guppies , there are also the studies of the galapagos finches by the grants , and studies of anole lizards in the bahamas . these are observable phenotypical changes , not speciation events .	0

do you believe the average individual actually has any personal control over providing basic essentials and security ? most individuals exist from proceeds of a ' job ' or government programs and would be lost without one or the other , of which they generally have no actual influence . i find it difficult to accept that the average , individual us citizen has the brain power to be concerned about anything but what ' s on tv . voter apathy of 25% or less participation in municipal elections are a strong indication of individual need to be manipulated as governing powers see fit .	0

well of course everybody is entitled . but as history has shown many southern states in america chose to ignore the constitution and deny black people their rights on the basis of their skin color , using the " black codes " enacted after the civil war . if it were not for the 1 4 th amendment that forced state governments to abide by the constitution , minorities would still be out in the cold . the only thing we have been over , is that government and gun control is racist , not the second amendment .	0

i already have , hence the explanation i provided . if you challenge me to show you an error then i will . did you expect me to try and show something that was true and see if i could convince you it wasn ' t ? when you post your evidence it usually has holes in it , not always but the truth is funny that way . it is very difficult sometimes to cover it up . and stay away from those shrimp , eagles , gays and snowmenthey are all abominations .	1
this is not discrimination because the adult once did have have the right to live in a womb until it could live otherwise . once out of the womb and living on his / her own this right has been exhausted because there is no need to be living in the womb . much like you can drive but this ' right ' is exhausted when you are drunk or too old to see anything .	0
you may have missed the context from the other thread i referred to . the point i made is that the unlikeliness of a presidential signature did not stop senator obama from voting in favor of a required iraq troop withdraw timetable . the promised veto threat did not matter in this instance . he was " standing on principle .

well , it depends on your definition of retarded i guess . the standards to get a drivers license are really not that high . think of how dumb the average person is , and realize that 50% of people are dumber than that . kinda makes you cringe . and you wonder what has prevented me from being in an accident ? well , perhaps the fact that i am a concientious , defensive , and skilled driver who excercises caution while on the road . maybe next time someone pulls out in front of me , i should just throw my hands in the air and scream " take the wheel jesus !

i believe that evolution is a perfectly logical idea .

how long has the boyfriend been 16 ? is he closer to 15 or 17 ? how long has nocturnal09 been 14 ? is she closer to 13 or 15 ? if nocturnal09 will be 15 in a couple of days or so and the boyfriend just turned 16 about a month ago , then the 14 vs 16 thing is not really the biggest deal . depending on when their b - days fall , they could both be in the same graduating class . he could have been born in may 1990 while she was born in july 1991 . therefor , he is 16 but she will still be 14 for at least another half of a month . now , none of this information was given . all i am saying is that the 2 year gap ( until more info is given there ) can not be considered the biggest problem .	0

do you realize , that the fetus has only recently not been defined as a human being . back when birth control first came out , planed parenthood wanted to make sure it would be leagle . so they redefined ' life ' to say that you had to draw breth . by the way have you ever seen any pictures of the aborted babies ?

i think that ' s an excellent question . since my area of expertise is chemistry and not climatology , i can only speculate that it ' s a combination of peer pressure , the desire to get funding and their allowing governments to manipulate their findings . there have been several instances in which members of the ipcc have quit amidst claims that the final reports issued did not reflect their research . since the final ipcc reports are reviewed by politicians prior to being published , i am not surprised with the claims made . here ' s a relevent story .	0

this is actually humorous coming from you who has absolutely no concept that you are a spiritual being , or the extra dimension of yourself which that reality means to you . in other words antonia , it is the epitome of self deceit to lie to oneself about who they are . and you define that darkness which is the great lie you represent so completely .	0

agreed that they are still the same species , much like the " 13 species " of darwin ' s finches , and i have no problem with evolution in that respect . i can even see the plausibility of different subspecies evolving eventually into different species if they are geographically separated for a sufficiently long time . but i still do not see where evolution , in that sense of the term , can account for dozens of species of monkeys occupying the same patch of rainforest , or dozens of species of gazelles occupying the same patch of grassland .	0

exactly who are you saying has revised the bible ? and with that question asked , i believe by admitting that if it was revised to delete the meat of it , it would be equally diluted in power , content and strength . really ? if you are speaking about jefferson still , then why did not he recommend that all punishments for homosexuality be erased from the law completely , and homosexuality be legalized at that time ? that would have been the just and magnanimous thing to do if he believed such tripe as you attribute to him .	0

i know i am presenting facts to archie , sorry . <repeated> archie , in point of fact you have it backwards . the theory of evolution was first , then abioegenesis . we know life exists . darwin , and others , explained how life changed from what it used to be to what it is now ; they had no concern for where it came from in the first place , they simply knew that it came from somewhere . how did they know it came from somewhere ? because there ' s life here now ! the answer to the question of where it all started did not get seriously studied until well after darwin . so no , the one does not pick up from the other , and the study of evolution does not in any way depend on abiogenesis . evolution does not care where life came from , only what happens to it once it ' s around .	1
oh , i agree with you . <repeated> oh wait , did a clarify argument show up in the argument listing ? damn ! i think it did !	1

i think often abortion is wrong but i do not agree with criminalizing it . primarily the reasons that are used to justify criminilzation are hugely fallacious and secondarily because it will not do a thing that is positive . a woman who is determined to end her pregancy - will . criminalization will simply make it extremely dangerous . i am responsible , have even had my tubes tied , but if i were to become pregnant and that pregnancy were the result of rape or a threat to my health or livlihood i would end it - and i will not be checking the law books first . every woman has her line in the sand - abortion will go on regardless of its legal standing . there are a miriad of reasons seek abortion - comdemning those reasons does nothing ( i . e . calling them selfish ) - addressing them could help . the reasons are valid .	0

what is conveniently missing from your response ? an explanation of why a limit on the number of guns that can be purchased during a certain time period is not a law which imposes " conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms " per heller . if the punishment does not fit the crime it does not necessarily follow that the crime is constitutionally protected . executing someone for shoplifting would be unjustifiable . however , that does not mean that there is a constitutional right to shoplift .	0

well yes that ' s what he did , but he did not try to present this as positive evidence for anything . the biomorphs were used to illustrate the point that random mutations are much more likely to produce beneficial results when the mutations are small . analogies always break down at some level , this analogy was used to illustrate a certain point . the assertion that dawkins was suggesting that a biomorph happening to look like a real life object were proof that evolution and natural selection could produce such creatures is false . montalban , to restore integrity i suggest you retract the conclusion you drew from snippets and quotes from dawkins as your paraphrasing was clearly not representative of dawkins ' ideas .	0

is this what jpsartre meant ? at any rate , to say that there were large numbers of gay men , being infected in the u . s . , is not saying there is a connection between aids or its spread and homosexuality in itself . there is a connection when there is active sexuality , gay or straight , and aids is a sexually transmitted disease . we actually do not know who patient zero was . what is the point of saying initially it affected much larger numbers of gay men , and fewer heterosexuals , to the best of our available knowledge ? this is a disease , and unknowingly spreading it , no matter who you are , is not murder . the fact that much more transmission was initially occuring in a certain group , who had sex among that group , before that group knew it existed and what it was and how to prevent it ; that would also not be murder .	0

thats why i say my gayness is his gift and blessing to me . there is nothing more joyous then gay sex .	1
this assumes brain - dead is a logical choice to consider one dead . even so , it proves nothing about when life begins . what says they have to be the same ? this is a classic example of a conclusion not following from the premise .	0
a being is something that is conceivable as existing . <repeated> or something that actually exists . a human being is one of us , a homo - sapien , a member of the group of beings known as animals . a rock is a being of inanimate qualities . god is the supreme being , not capable of being understood totally as this would put him ( or it , or she ) on the same level as those that he created . we will never be able to define exactly what or who god is ! god is great . god is good . let us thank him for our food . god is my shepherd . god is my light . god is my co - pilot . god is what keeps me from believing that all this ( the totality of all things and happenings ) came about by accident . when god made man , she was only kidding ! <wink>	0
that is strange the last i read bin laden absolutely hates the regime in iran , mainly becasue iran is run by the shia and bin laden is a sunni . so iran should be held accountable for actions of bin laden ? it seems like before ( iraq ) people are trying to conjure up links between the real terrorist threat ( aq ) and unrelated nation .	0
i think our culture is going to play a big role in this as well . i think that is where the majority of this problem lies .	0
i could have labeled my post " <allcaps> trap </allcaps> " and you would not notice . tell me , are these two contradictory :	1
they have changed . for example , ancient examples of coelacanth were shallow water species , while the modern coelacanth is a deep marine species ( actually , two or three species ) . and the differences are enough to put them in different families . by the way , ark guy , what do you know about taxonomy ?	0
depends on how basic they are . not much call for using flint , steel and tinder to start fires .	1
i am a redneck because , unlike you , i believe in self - determination ? ! <repeated> emoticonxwow	1
yawn . <repeated> you are so obsessed with gay sex . i am not . enough said .	1
well , all i can say then is that no action is just about as bad as failed action , and is as bad in terms of anything current . either way you do not have gay marriage . you have a majority in congress right now , and you are not demanding much change just because of fear of backlash ? yeah , there would be backlash . heck , the civil war was the ultimate backlash , but that did not stop abolitionists from demanding more than <allcaps> token </allcaps> change , and it ' s a good thing they did . it ' s your gig , though , so do what you want . i do not see much point in laboring this discussion any more ; i am just pointing out my observations .	0
if a square is opposite to a circle ( and it is not , by the way ) , then gas / liquid / solid must be opposites therefore you contain opposites ( by your own argument ) , in that you contain elements that are in these ' opposite ' states . it ' s an argument i raised before , you said they were not opposites , now you cite non - opposites ! why do you keep refuting previous arguments they <allcaps> you </allcaps> have made ?	0
michael moore hates america is also coming out in theaters some time in october .	1
think of it as a photocopy of a check for a million dollars . yes the copy is in the image and likeness of the original check , but it is not the check . you cannot cash the photocopy , regardless of how accurate the copy is , it is not the check , only an image of it . that does not mean anything is " wrong " with the original , and it doesnt mean that the copy has to have all the properties and function of the original . its just an image	0
did you even notice that they were not the first to report it ? oh wait , you did not because you are obviously using the fallacy of selective observation .	1
well we assume a right to your own body here . it is also important for you to justify why there should be a difference in human and person and then justify why doing so this time is different from when this was previously done in history . i guess i do not agree with the idea that you have no rights until you can prove you should have them . <repeated> if this is the standard then we are all in trouble .	0
never heard of him . <repeated> however , looks like those ever - loving proponents of free speech up in canada showed anne coulter that ' free - speech ' is only what liberals make it to be . <repeated>	1
impressive . misses the point , biggoted , and regionalistic . you have got a whole ignorance trifecta going there ! well done . emoticonxgood	1
wow ! . <repeated> if your interpretation were correct , there would be a connection between his post and the <allcaps> ussr </allcaps> ! but it ' s not , and there is not .	1
you are assuming a need to reduce it because government , or a special interest , requests it . if enough people want it reduced , their demands of manufacturers and buying habits will reduce it . deemed by whom ? the government , or a special interest ? who cares about the species ? the majority of individuals , or the government , or a special interest ? if the majority does not consider them problems , then no solutions are necessary .	0
so , i guess you did not get the memo that this country was <allcaps> founded </allcaps> on christian / judaic beliefs . remember : you do have rights ; to an extent .	0
wow many false gods beat an actual one . christinity may only believe in one god , the god .	1
yep , you libs would love that . then you could party on end without having your carnal consciences tweaked , <allcaps> lol </allcaps> ! no sin then no need for a savior .	1
this is not to say that every current dictionary includes such a definition . <repeated> yet . <repeated> but a number of major on - line ones demonstrably do , and to my knowledge human civilization has yet to suffer any negative effects . ( by the way , the above entries also include the typical " husband and wife " kind of arrangement as well . funny how words can have more than one meaning , is not it ? )	1
once again when is my life , what i do , and who i love , who i marry , any more thier business then theirs is to me ? you still have not answered my question . why do they get a say in my life yet i do not get the same say in their lives ? anyone who wants to but into other peoples lives in the way these religious x <elongated> are is just cruel and evil . it is my life my family not theirs . they get theirs yet try and stop me from having mine that is unjust . you are defending an unjust system .	0
it also allows <allcaps> scotus </allcaps> to strike down state laws that violate constitutional rights <wink>	0
well then the courts must be insane . because i am sure there are some gun control laws that they are struck down due to their ineffectiveness .	1
go out there and find all kinds of democrat - led , black - led , white - led , mexican - led , etc . <repeated> efforts to protect gay rights . just because you can not find them does not mean they are against them . saying all republicans are against gay rights because one of them is , is bigoted , stereotypical and childish . quite moronic too . is it also your claim that all blacks are prejudiced because they have not formed the naawp yet ? grow up .	1
heart bypass , prostate cancer . <repeated> i have a couple of canadian friends who needed those surgeries and one was told he had a 4 month wait and the other a 6 month wait so they both came down to bellingham wash and had the surgery within 2 weeks . <repeated>	0
lol bias dysfunctions . i am surprised you know such a long word . pity you do not know what it means . i can not blame you . <repeated> being a retarded ignorant white woman . you do not even understand the absurdity of your own beliefs . go back to cleaning the house . worse is that you do not work yet you take the piss out of immigrants who work but do not pay taxes . you are better how ?	1
well , then why are the doctors trying 2 also test the embyonic cells ? what ' s their reason then ? we do not know , because the doctors might not want everything that they are doing be on the front page of every newspaper . they have their reasons for their actions , and they just do not want people like you to know about them . or . <repeated> they already have their reasons published and everything and you are just 2 close - minded 2 take the information in .	1
an objective test ? wow ! tell me , how do you prove this test is a true useful test ? please do not tell me reason or yet another objective test .	1
ah <elongated> i see so god was more than willing to use extreme punishment for not loving your neighbor . like how sodom and gomorrah were punished for not loving their neighbor .	1

i just love how deliciously ironic this statement here is . well done .	1

did you read the artical ? to show our children that they are no different then any other .	0
so what are you claiming now ? that all this time that rosie was making fun of the chinese , she ' s actually been chinese all the while ? because that ' s the only legitimate way you could draw a parallel with those people who are hypocritically attacking gays while being gay themselves .	1
774 billion to china in debt . <repeated> where are you going to ' buy ' new technology ? oh right . <repeated> from china .	1
right . it ' s called stasis . species that are well adapted to their environments tend to change little in a stable environment . it is still true that fossil crocs are not the same as modern crocs . there are obvious differences .	0
dear , as i have already said that rape is committed by persons of imbalance minds / or intoxicated persons . so , logically they can not exercise self control ( and that ' s y we call them mentally imbalanced ) . i agree , that if a woman says no , it means no . but , in that state of mind a man can not understand that she is denying , what a rapist thinks is only his sexual gratification . and that ' s y its a crime . and we have punishments for it . <repeated> thank you for ur time . and i appreciate ur views . <repeated>	0
yes i disagree with that point . the navy , just like the police , can not possibly be everywhere that danger might raise its ugly head . merchant ships can not afford a 24 / 7 navy escort anymore than the average citizen can afford to hire body guards 24 / 7 . there ' s no legitimate reason why merchant ships should be unarmed and unable to address dangers that deliberately come after them .	0
that ' s nice , but have you ever thought of reading your own religion ' s holy book so that you can intelligently discuss what it is that jesus and his disciples said ?	1
and you wonder why people call " republicans " racist , women hating bigots . ( hint : it ' s comments like yours )	1
actually , it ' s true . one darwin ' s basic ideas upon which he based the theory of natural selection .	0
really . some people would think i am in cahoots with the creationists . i predict their behavior and then they go and do it .	1
but that is your goal whether you want to admit it or not . and that is your sole way of defending creationism as you have admitted you cannot argue creationism based on its own merits . creationism is wrong independent of evolution . even if you somehow manage to disprove evolution ( along with every science ) you still have to even take a single step towards proving creationism .	0
not quite . to be more correct regarding government and guns , the right to own weapons is for the right to revolt and revolt with violence . our political philosophy is very clear on this : " that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it " - declearation of independaceyou have the right to try and revolt with violence . you do not have the right to win a revolt .	0
really ? what book is that , because i have seen no quotes or links to any source of any info at all from you anywhere above on this page . so once again accipiter , what in the world are you referring to ? you and the obvious child oughta get along fine since you both offer nothing more substantial than personal attacks which are based on your own warped beliefs and corrupted interpretations of that which you disagree with . here ' s my original post again , i challenge you to explain how these alleged stone age sheep herders whom you scoff at and mock described contemporary living creatures which paleontologists today identify as dinosaurs , from skeletal remains ?	1
that is not quite what the ' mitochondrial eve ' hypothesis posits . science . 1995 dec 22 ; 270 ( 5244 ) : 1930 - 6 . the myth of eve : molecular biology and human origins . ayala fj . university of california , irvine , <allcaps> usa </allcaps> . it has been proposed that modern humans descended from a single woman , the " mitochondrial eve " who lived in africa 100,000 to 200,000 years ago . the human immune system drb1 genes are extremely polymorphic , with gene lineages that coalesce into an ancestor who lived around 60 million years ago , a time before the divergence of the apes from the old world monkeys . the theory of gene coalescence suggests that , throughout the last 60 million years , human ancestral populations had an effective size of 100,000 individuals or greater . molecular evolution data favor the african origin of modern humans , but the weight of the evidence is against a population bottleneck before their emergence . the mitochondrial eve hypothesis emanates from a confusion between gene genealogies and individual genealogies .	0
reread my argument , please . i do not see incest as good or anything . what i do see is that the only real rational argument against it is the genetic trouble with offspring ( all other arguments are actually problems that cause incest , not consequences of incest ) . and here , i see hipocrisy . we are prohibiting incest , but are not instituting a global consistent policy that would apply to any and all parents where genetic risks exist . adult heterosexual consenting non - related parents whose procreation is almost guaranteed to cause genetic defects ? we leave it to them to decide and choose the preventive measures . related ? prohibit regardless of chance . and really , i would actually fully support such a ( yes , very invasive ) globally consistent policy . the double standard annoys me , not that i advocate incest ( something people here fail to acknowledge ) .	0
because it ' s a blatantly obvious fact of nature and intellectually honest experts in the field accept it .	0
and i am going to correct you again . the theory of evolution is by no means an extreme view . it is the prevailing view . more than 99% of biologists accept the theory of evolution as the best explanation for the observations .	0
i think it would be an exception as well . but if you see an indicator that might point to an " exception " , i think the question should be asked . consider the flip side of things . the question does not get asked . if skip had been the type of man to let a gay couple ' s house burn to spite gays , do not you think that the gay couple would have had grounds to sue the city in such a situation ? part of this is just the city covering its own <allcaps> x <elongated> </allcaps> . if they ask the question , and the guy lies , they have helped to cover their own <allcaps> x <elongated> </allcaps> by asking the question .	0

where did you get this from ? i want to read it .	0
what is a ' higher ' species . if you mean a more intelligent primate ? <repeated> the concept there is a hierarchy of ' higher ' and ' lower ' species is incorrect . theonly difference between man and the other primates is that man has a hyperdeveloped brain . there are two sugars that are naturally produced by body by most mammals . when investingating the presnece of these chemicals , one of them is present in much lower concentrations in the brainsof all mammals . however , humans have a mutation that interrupted the production of this chemical . a piece of random junk got inserted into the middle of the gene that produces this chemical , and disabled it . sometimes , evolution is not so much about what is added , but what is removed .	0
how about other religious theories . what about teaching about the sun god ? i do not mean that they believed that , but teach it as a choice because everyone deserves the right to choose in what they believe . actually let us also teach how the theory of gravity could be wrong and people can choose to believe that invisible fairys pull people down towards the earth and other massive objects . we should teach the theory of gravity also but we need to give them the choice on what to believe .	1

orion ' s follies : some other goodies from that site . <repeated> never linked to those specific articles . but before orion gets too self - righteous , let us look at some ot the topics he considered ' funny ' in a link he gave over at the usat creation / evolution forum : christian crimes - pastor molests widow ' s boys - pastor molests adopted daughters - priest molests altar boys - late for church - christian racist kidnapper - music pastor molests - bush ' s faith - based failure - pastor molest , guns , drugs - $400,000 missing - priest molests - church youth coach molests - bush suppresses student prayer - sen byrd ' s ' white ( ' n ' word ) ' is this funny ? it ' s apparently real funny to orion . his link also had a pornographic sub - link on the virgin mary , describing her in graphic , profane language . orion - christ - deniers like you and brummer need a lot of help .	1

funny . that ' s not what the articles say . all of the articles pretty much concentrate on the research as significant in support of the dinosaur / bird link . if you had been paying attention , you would have been aware that it had been previously established through other tests that protein remnants were present . thus , the amazement that protein remnants so old had been found had already passed .	0
oh , it ' s obvious that non - darwinists have no affect on you guys . nothing will ever change your mind because your mind is not made up on the evidence . <repeated> it ' s made up on your worldview and your belief in materialism .	1

that ' s not exactly true now , is it ? people get to vote for elected officials , and that ' s all that ' s guaranteed federally . some states have provisions for allowing people to vote on local laws , but in some states the government is allowed to prevent the vote . and of course there is no provision at all allowing the people to vote on federal laws . so in point of fact it is a true statement that in the united states someone is not allowed to vote on x , for some values of x .	0

you are a darling , j . coulda used you here earlier , though , to straighten this mess out . as far as ' stalking ' goes , btw , my first appearance here was 11/08/94 ( the same day i told those on the ny times board about this forum . ) the poster in question ( infamous on the same board , though he pretends not to be ) first appeared on 11/16/04 . who ' s stalking whom ?	0
as to the first part , i answered you above . regarding the second part ; what in the world are you talking about ? girls who are born from unfertilized eggs ? and boys born of virgin mothers ? can you post any evidence of these cases ? beside jesus of course , because we know his father is god and that he possesses the holy spirit .	1
who decides which portions are appropriate for literal interpetation ? how od you know they are right ? has it ever occured to you that the whole invisible man in the sky thing is probably not a good canidate for literal interpetation ? perhaps , as the roman elite at the time claimed , the bible was compiled , and christianity was heavily pushed , primarily as a method of controlling the people . we know the bible was heavily edited . we know that much of it was written decades after the events occured , and not by the folks claimed . is not literally interpeting anything that fraudulent a pretty poor idea ?	1
actually " i do not know " is quite a valid answer in science . however , again you slip into this false construct of a belief that all that can be known is in the scope of science ; which you have also denied saying you believe in the past .

as i mentioned above , science curriculums follow paths . one ' s worldview plays heavily on one ' s interpretation of scientific data . an agnostic , or atheist teaching establishment can become satisfied with one path of scientific theories without searching for others . there may be more to be discovered about thermodynamics , cell structure , irreducible complexity , the decay rate of the earth ' s magnetic field , radiometric dating , the fossil record , and countless other things that a teaching establishment may not be interested in exploring , if it ' s comfortable with it ' s interpretation of current data ' s indications that the happenstance origins worldview is correct . it goes back to what we touched on before - teaching students <allcaps> how </allcaps> to think , not <allcaps> what </allcaps> to think .	0

( the people who later became the brady campaign ) have claimed that the memo is a hoax and that what was released has never been their official position . however them simply stating this , is no different than obama making a statement on national news , and then several months later saying " i never said that " and trying to reverse his position . until it can be proven beyond doubt as being untrue and simple propaganda , the memo is real and explains in detail exactly what the gun control groups are after .	0

actually , at 24 weeks is when the the interconnection of the fetal brain begins . the nerve cells from the neocortex begin to synapse with the nerve cells of the thalamus . it is at this point that bursts of recognizable brain waves start to appear among the random signals that go on before . it is at this point that some scientists believe a fetus can feel pain as well . it is also at this point that a fetus can possibly survive outside of the womb ( 23 - 24 weeks ) , though the cance of survival is low and the risk of impairment very serious . this point probably will not change with technology either because the fetal lung is not mature enough until this point for even mechanical - assisted breathing .	0

you mean ' junk dna ' ? i think it ' s more than 20% , more like 95% <url> <url> <url> i do not think that ' s what the poster was referring to , i really think he / she was ignorant of what scientists really know . basically , the fact that its there points me in the direction of evolution . also the fact that there are conserved regions of dna within codons and exons points me toward evolution as the explanation . oh , now i see ! of course they know what their own acronym stands for . they also know why they named the bases a ( adenine ) g ( guanine ) t ( thymine ) c ( cytosine ) u ( uracil ) . they named them when they were discovered . i think the poster was saying they do not know how they work , which is quite false . of course , the mechanism of protein transcription has been known for quite some time .	0

first of all , the government cannot increase the volume and social acceptance of a drug - only the market and society can do that . government cannot even decrease the volume or social acceptance of drugs - despite the government ' s efforts , drug use has remained relatively constant . what has not remained constant is violent crime , which has gone up during the drug war as it did during alcohol prohibition .	0

but it makes you look a fool that you make comments without knowing . does not it . so you think that just because you enter a debate half - way , you can still give an uninformed opinion ? were not you the one ready to laugh at me ? i will not laugh at you . i am only saddened by your personal attacks . yes , repeating yourself . i know what they say , you know what they say . i do not agree with them , on these points . answers in genesis are ' right ' by your account on this occasion - see my previous post about us both being ' selective ' in the information we use ; again a lack of insight into your own thought processes . i disagree with them . do you agree with their claim that speciation in fact disproves evolution ? i bet you have been very selective here too !	1
yes secular governments work . nor does it take much to see the philosophical similarities , as pointed out by trebor , between a religion , such as christianity or islam and communism , socialism , capitalism , totalitarism or a monarchy , but it does require an additional step , hence my comment of 2 + 2 + 2 . but just for kicks , let us say i am fully on board with communism as a religion and am now jumping ship on the idea . this would be the only reason you can give , other than what you have misunderstood which is explained abvove , that makes the study flawed . which does not take a genius to grasp makes no sense whatsover . so take your time , think about it , because there is an argument to made for your view and i am surprised nobody picked up on it , but let us see if you can figure it out on your own .	1

actually , we did not . the first record of a melanic form was in 1848 . presumably other melanic individuals had appeared before this , both in biston bebularia as well as other moths . we know that a similar mutation occucrred in other moths north america some years after the 1848 record of the b . betualria . there are actually several alleles of the gene responsible for color that form a dominence hierarchy with the fully black morph ( called carbonaria ) as the top dominant and the typical as recessive . the intermediate forms are referred to as insularia . they are uncommon . at any rate , by 1895 , 98% of observed b . betularia in industrialized areas were carbonaria .	0
ah yes , the ' let us pull a smug and self serving quote out of context from the bible and use it as in insult , therefore god exist ' routine . that arrogant method of using self congratulatory bible quotes to insult and denigrate your opponent is neither an effective debate technique , or does it help convince those people on the boarder line to convert to christianity . it does drive them away , so please , be my guest and keep on trying to use it . i figure the ratio of people you drove away from christianity to those people who were converted to christianity from you must be way lop sided .	1

because if you let gays marry because it is an alternitve way the equal protection says that if you let one happen you have to let the others have that right to . but that is not really my point my real point is that if we let this happend it will ruin marriage in this country , marriage is a bond between a man and a women and if we let gays marry this country will be ruining that tradition thus making this country more secular then it all ready is . <allcaps> and we have to stop that </allcaps> .	0

daniel dennett asks , how did just one species , homo sapiens , acquire the numinous perspective that can have such a profound influence on people ' s lives ? he seems to think that religions evolved and originally served a ' primitive ' philosophical intention - such as explaining the hidden ' causes ' of natural events in pre - scientific societies . to give just one example : the rise and fall of the tides were observed , but not understood . so the phenomena were attributed to the power of a god ( or gods ) etc . i think this is a pretty commonplace answer , but not necessarily wrong . why has religion survived the scepticism of the intellectual enlightenment and the rational attacks of science ? the idea that some fundamental ' psychic need ' in humanity is satisfied by having religious beliefs seems ( to me ) the most promising speculation .	0
yes , i will mark that on my calendar for future reference . <repeated> get help man . <repeated> really . <repeated> you need it .	1
no one believes this . this is a non - issue . i am not surprised you would respond that way jyoshu . you do not take these issues seriously at all . thus you can have a good laugh , and be sarcastic and think you are witty . in reality , it shows how clueless you are in terms of gay issues . ' the equality - obsessed modern gay pride movement ' ? gays do not have equality , and therefore there is a movement for that . i do not think anyone is obsessed with equality . i could just as quickly say there is an obsession with keeping gays in an unequal status .	0

so ? <repeated> it was still a speech made for the purpose of political support of gay marriage . yes , i watched it . agreed . it was for the purpose of appealing to emotion ( to a political end ) . no , but my point is that neither does the sanitized ' norman rockwell ' image that some gay - pride proponents want projected by linking to videos such as the one here . it might give the impression that gay pride is merely some ' family - friendly ' movement without the reality of the very dark side to it .	0

about a third of the weapons seized in mexico were referred to the u.s. for tracing ; approximately 11,000 out of 29,000 . about half were successfully traced . better than 90% of those to u.s. dealers . of course your definition of " minute " might differ from mine .	1
please clarify what you are saying here as it makes no sense to me . what point are you trying to make ? off the top though , any comparison you make with being black and homosexuality is false because the bible does not condemn being black but it does condemn the homosexual act / lifestyle . and who does the anti - defamation league promote hating ? i am unaware of it if they do it .	0

sure , but then you get into all sorts of problems of classifications , slippery slopes , and other awkward messes . arguing whether an embryo or a fetus is a person seems to raise more trouble than it might solve . it seems better to err on the side of caution and devise a pro - choice argument that assumes the embryo or fetus to be a person rather than worry whether they are a person .	0

so if it ' s not human , we can kill it ? but i dare say that ' s a different topic completely . sorry , that was more along animal rights than abortion . abortion is this for me : if the baby is going to endanger the mother ' s life as well as the baby , why endanger the baby and the mother ? sticking on the decided path , would you rather kill something you know is human , or something that you are not sure is human . it sounds a bit cruel and i did not intend it to be that way at all . it ' s just that one loss would hard enough , why make it two ?	1

i am impressed ! this is a very precise description , in regular englishand yes , the deduction in 9 seems presumptious if all we state is god has a " possibility of existence " . how this was cleverly cleared up ( from the same source site ) was simply a trip back to the definition : " greatest possible being " . the " greatest possible being " , by definition , <allcaps> must </allcaps> have a possible existence . in otherwords , we cannot assume that there is a possibility that the greatest possible being does not exist . yeah , it sounds like the whole " proof " is pointless because your premise is already the proofjust keep in mind that for the purposes of this proof , god is defined as " the greatest being possible " . as long as that definition is maintained , the proof works . <repeated> does that mean that god exists ? hmm <elongated> . <repeated> emoticonxfrazzled	0
and what if he had said fiance ? would you have suddently admitted that their love is real ? pointing out a different word choice than you would have used does not appear to mean anything . if you are certain that their love is not real , why do not you explain your reasoning that led you to this conclusion ? it seems to me that a gay person knows his own love better than someone who has never even met that gay person . do you have some knowledge which disagrees ?	0

i love that you guys dont seem to be joking when you talk about it being offensive to gays - if anything i would think only tom cruise would find it offensive - because of his claims that he isnt gay ( obviously untrue ) gays would probably cheer if he ( along with his penis ) would come out of the closet if someone would find this offensive , it wouldnt be me vs gay guys - it would be me vs overly sensitive and selfrighteous guys who happen to be gay	0

no , gun registration should not be mandatory anywhere in the us . the government has no business knowing who has a gun . gun registration could possibly allow the government to infringe on constitutional guarantees provided by the bill of rights . just knowing that there are many senators and congressmen who would like to abolish gun rights gives credence to the fact that government could actually try to limit or ban the 2 nd amendment in the future . p.s. crazy is as crazy says . scary to think that some would believe that a registered gun that becomes a stolen gun would help in finding the thief or killer if that same criminal gets rid of the gun . which , if later found , would then be traced back to the legitimate owner , who may not even know the gun had been stolen . the alibi better be outstanding !	1

atheism does not have that standard because it ' s not that encompassing a thought . all athiesm is , is a lack of theism , period . it says nothing about morals or ethics . your typical athiest , though , looks within to find what ' s moral or ethical and it usually just stems from what ' s acceptable behavior within the human species . this is also where religion gets its morality and ethics . but times change , and eating shellfish will not kill you , and eating meat on friday will not make the farmers go broke , so the morals and ethics change to fit the society .	0

you would say that , because you are neither a woman , nor gay . families were ruled by the husband with a clenched iron fist by the way , and women and children had few rights . the family structure was " secure " that way . yes , the fact that there was lower teen pregnancy outside of marriage , is just such a good thing in and of itself . this meant fewer people burning in hell , which is what is really important . emoticonxrolleyes	1
the value of logical reasoning is dependent upon your axioms . highly religious people are no less capable of reasoning logically than anyone else - but the unshakeable axiom that their personal version of god really exists enters into every equation . for you , one axiom is the existence of vitality ; volition made quantifiable , and the other is that darwinian evolution must be wrong and worthless in every respect . there is no logical reason for you to deride ns the way you do ; it ' s an integral part of any evolutionary theory that seeks to explain the big picture of how the organisms we see around us came to be ; the occurrence of mutations , volitional or otherwise is not enough on its own . but your axioms prevent you from incorporating it into <allcaps> eam </allcaps> and getting on with your life .	0

however , just because the majority of people share something in common does not always mean the truth ? very good . philosophers call this type of argument ' argumentum ad populum ' . it is a fallacy that many people are prone to commit . you can choose a sonnet and correctly pick ' s its emotion but you can never be so sure i agree . shakespearean scholars often disagree about very miniscule details . but i think just because they are not ' sure ' , that does not mean that they can not be certain . maybe you could go google ' shakespeare sonnet 1 ' and read just the first poem of his sonnets collection . tell me what you think ! i am sure that shakespeare will charm you like he has charmed so many .	0

semantics . god has mandated against homosexuality . my point is , people are prepared to admit that the creation story , and the story of noahs arc are metaphors . they read them , and then look at the evidence to hand and say " well , it can not be really true the way it is written , so it must mean this . <repeated> " but the bias of the church against homosexuality is based of a small passage of text which , it seems , cannot be interpreted away . that part that condemns homosexuality is accurate , straight - from - gods - mouth truth . again , why the dichotomy ? why are some parts of the bible open to interpretation , but others are rigid ?	0

i did not answer or you did not understand ? actually i did answer . the knee joint i described is from a bipedal hominid - there is no question about it . the skull , even though i gave it very ape - like features , is from a biped . there are many examples of what i described .	0
i looked it up and apparently there is a synthetic form of <allcaps> thc </allcaps> on the market , ( generically known as dronabinol and sold under the trade name marinol ) . but it is only allowed under restricted prescription ( it ' s a schedule ii controlled substance , the same as morphine or cocaine ) and is far less effective than plant - derived <allcaps> thc </allcaps> .	0
interesting , but it appears to ignore the fact that there is pre - existing variation ( just look at the pictures ) . emphasizing mutations is ok , but relying solely on them will probably skew results .	0
apparently you need to read up on up - to - date cases of fetus viability and premature birth success statistics . that ' s right , and she does it after the baby is born by caring for it as well . so ? i guess you ' d also be in favor of it being legal for a mother to not allow her baby to live because she has to care for it after it ' s born too , with that reasoning . there are many , many women in the pro - life movement . my wife is one of them and she is a lot more passionate about it than i am . ( trust me , you do not want to be in a room with her after you have killed a baby ! ) if you think this is a men versus women issue , you are sadly mistaken .	1

why do you think they feel no emotion ? all the women i know who have aborted did so under very difficult circumstances and it was horrible for them . most women who seek abortion are not unfeeling sluts . they are real women , with real issues , and real circumstances that lead them to that choice . want to help those babies ? address the issues the women face and do not demonize . no amount of legislation can make for succesful pregnancy without the support of the mother . dismiss her and you will fail to do anything to help anyone .	0

hello my dear ! what do you think people should live in a peaceful world ? as you know george washington is cruel man who did a lot of bad things in order to be success , to get high position ? you know that a lot of people died from washington ? most people from iran and irak suffered more distress and you can not imanige that situation . what about the twin towers ? maybe you think that that accident was by muslin people ? no , it was not ! of course washington did it in order to substitute muslim men	0

yes , in my view , it would be morally correct since it has no brain and , in my definition , is not a person with rights . however , if she does not want to support the violinist in that future , she has the responsibility to disconnect from ( and therefore kill ) that brainless body before the brain gets transplanted . otherwise , if she waits to disconnect until it is too late , she would be guilty of killing the violinist ( a person ) .	0
there is a pretty huge difference . civil unions are not nationally recognized , for one thing , since not every state has them . if you travel to a state that does not offer civil unions , then your union is not valid there . i think there ' s a problem with dissolving those unions as well . the big difference , though , are the rights that these unions provide . there are over 1,000 legal protections and rights that marriage provides that civil unions do not . i will try and find a list of differences .	0

archie is <allcaps> not </allcaps> right - he has an opinion , as we all do . pro - lifers seem to want the definition of human with attendant rights to begin at conception . the blastocyst is now turning into a tumour . so the pro - lifers can now alter their views on what constitutes ' human ' as and when it suits their purpose . forget the emotive view of what an embryo / foetus looks like : some think that as long as it has appendages and looks human , then it is . it is not . it ' s still a parasitic organism dependant on the host mother . you can not deny that . contraception v . abortion is a separate issue : in the meantime , the host mother should be the final arbiter of what happens to her body .	0

well this is what i am saying . the probability of a and b in one organism i very low . and the probability of a and b in many generations is lower than just a . this is what behe deals with in his book . one reason evolution of primates interest me more than bacteria is the the number of organisms and generations is much much lower , and the changes involved must be pretty big . it involves real evolution as opposed to stuff like antibiotic resistance or sicke cell haemoglobin that i see more as a reversable adaption , not a developement to a permanently better / more complex state . <allcaps> imo </allcaps> there should be possible to make some sort of calculation regarding the probability of rm being cause of the changes .	0

i just do not see that being a huge factor . it might help some , but if my goal was to improve foreign relations reigning in spending would not be the first approach i would take . can you expand on your reasoning ? the start of that chain is belligerence , not out of control spending . seems to me that if you want to control spending you should work on foreign relations . that way you get into fewer wars , and when you must fight you have others helping and sharing the cost .	0

i will stop quoting here . do not want people to have too big a read . actually toe is not all that random . to a certain degree yes . but sexual selection aka a part of the toe . dictates that when there is a benificial / attractive change . that change will be enhanced almost exponentially . because the female of the species will be programmed to search for that and will carry the gene herself so will give it to her off spring . and the male will be more succesfull so produce more off spring . so no instant eyes or anything like that . i think that ' s what you were implying . sorry for responding in kronus ' s stead . i am sure he can defend himself but i found it unjust the way you replied to his post and attacked it on foundations that you did not have .	0

that ' s <allcaps> exactly </allcaps> the point . regardless of whether or not human minds think differently , whichever mind produced and agrees that 2 + 2 = 4 is absolutely correct , the rest are wrong . we know this because we can observe and test the concept in the physical world and prove that it is true . this goes for just about anything , dissention in the face of facts does not change the facts . <allcaps> imho </allcaps> , this invalidates your claim that something produced in the human mind is not absolute due to some human minds being contradictory .	0

no . that ' s not what i said . i said that natural selection is differential reproductive success . i said that those organisms that possessed advantageous characteristics would tend to reach reproductive age more frequently and therefore they will tend to produce more offspring , while those with disadvantageous characteristics will tend to produce fewer offspring . as a result , the heritable characteristics of the population will change over time .	0

oh , is <allcaps> that </allcaps> where you are getting your information ? the biotic message ? i read the book tens years ago and eventually sold it because it wasn ' t worth keeping . you do know that it is a book on biology written not by a biologist , but by an engineer . right ? walter jame remine is a mere engineer of some sort , and has no degree in biology . and biologists strongly argue against his claims . ps : i even had a few exchanges with remine when i was posting at <allcaps> arn </allcaps> . i argued against him , even though i was an idist at the time , because he was not being truthful .	0

well then this does not answer my question . if you have 10 doctors for 100 people ( this is just an example ) and only 50 of them have health insurance and each doctor gets paid $100 a year then your health care per capita is $10 ( [ 1 0 doctors x $100 ] / 100 people ) . if you change it to 100 people with health insurance you now have $10 per capita as well because you population did not change . health care costs are shown per capita and not per person insured : per capita health expenditures by country , 2007 — infoplease . comso again , if you go from $6,000 per capita per that website given above to say switzerland levels at $4,100 per capita then where did that money come from ?	0
you of course have documentation of darwin laying out his plan as to how to weasel evolution into classrooms to oust theism , right ? no ? you are making it all up ? shocking .	1
not to me , but let us not quibble about things we can not change . let us talk about something that we can change . <repeated> for a change . we could argue about it forever and never change one thing that ' s written . how about making a proposal suited to fit those whose religious beliefs tend to make us feel inferior ? or passing legislation that more medical staff be trained in ' special ' fields of medicine for certain diseases so that constant referrals will not bounce us off the walls .	1
you either did not read my post thoroughly , or are intentional misrepresenting me . post 250 ( which i had actually read before starting this thread ) is nothing but dametel rambling about homologies between vertebrae embryos . that has absolutely nothing to do with the unexplained homologies that the denton talks about . evolution simply cannot , reasonably speaking , account for the homology between your arm and leg , among other examples .	0
but still , if you think there are rights in the bill of rights that is wrong , that should not be granted or guaranteed , it would be a viable option to vote for removing them . what debate are you trying to end here ? the debate : ' do you want little or less gun - control ' ?	0

this is getting mighty old trebor . i will take that last post as a tacit admission that you had , indeed , invented budge as a source . the question then becomes , where did you get these ideas from first time around , and why are not you sharing them with us ? why did you feel compelled to fib ? this photo brings up a bunch of other questions . on what website did you just find that picture ? how and why are you interpreting it as it you are ?	0

well , assuming that when the bible says " you " in passages that are telling " you " to do something with your soul , i would hope that it also applies to women . but it never comes out and says " women and men have souls .

oh yes matt , i am just an angry little ogre who can not stand to think that gays might find happiness in this lifetime , [ sarcasm ] . get a clue matthew , i have no personal investment at all regarding your life or your lifestyle . all i am doing is sharing the spiritual truths that you hate to hear or consider . do not blame me because you live a life of delusions and self deception , because that is the life you are living . and none of those so called good people who encourage and show tolerance for your chosen lifestyle are your friends at all . and yet you prefer their lies to my truth . go figure huh ?	1

so what about jesus ' life is credible if the source is unreliable ? was it that jesus didnt walk on water but he fed 5000 with 5 loaves ? was it that he didnt forgive the samaritan harlot but he raised lazarus from the dead ? what did the authors get right ? i mean , i can easily believe jesus said he came to bring a sword and not peace . but you dont . so how do we possibly pattern our lives according to how jesus lived if we dont know whether what they recorded was actually what he did ? it is necessary to believe that the gospels are true , otherwise you cannot follow a pattrn you dont have .	0

honk ! wrong . my parents inherited a house from their parents . they also inherited knowledge and were taught certain values . concepts stored in one brain , expressed via words and encoded in a new brain . epigenetic inheritance , yet still materialistic . does not mean they did not also inherit a bunch of genes , and for the umpteenth time it does not mean they get to screw their face up like hiro and tweak them whenever they like . should not i be asking you that , since that ' s what you say happens , despite having exactly zero evidence to back it up ? honk ! what a great big fat juicy lie , ss . do not put it in the keep net though ; toss it back so you can use it again later .	1
i totally agree . you never know what you might pick up . but he likes to eat hey ? that ' s weird . but to each his own . i like to eat more normal food myself . but if you explore certain sides of someones personality , do you really learn anything ? how do you know you just do not watch and then five minutest after you explore the personality , you forgot everything about that person . i mean , i do not know , but i have some trouble picking up on personalities right away of people i meet . has anyone ever tried spilling tuna on the floor on purpose ? i am just wondering because that would be weird .	0

well said . with this religion , the gap is very wide between the " average guy " and " authority " , because their clergy is more involved in politics than the clergy of christianity , or the creator himself . it fits with more democrats being evolutionists , and more democrats favoring bigger domestic government .	0
if information came into being by chance , how can we know that anything is true ? how do you know what is false and what is " true " ? if we are just products of chance , your brain is also a product of chance . therefore , the thought patters that determine your logic are also products of chance . if your logic is the result of chance processes , you can not even be sure it evolved properly . you can not even be sure you can reason properly ( using your definition ) because you can not trust your own logic . as for the second part , no , you have got it backward , rational belief is based on faith in a rational creator . references <kiss> the creationist basis for modern science . * the lie : evolution ~ ken ham . * evolution : fact or fiction ? ~ john blanchard .	0

so how is the oil and gas agreement with china working out for you antipodeans ?	1
ditto squared . if they support killing a perfectly healthy unborn child , they will argue that the reason stated in the op is the main reason abortion is needed and justified . and i must say that if 98% of all abortions were performed for that reason , the public stance against them might not be so strong .	0
and you think this a good thing ? it just shows the weak cowardly position of the creationist .	0
ah , you have engaged in the grammarian nitpick function of debate . sad , but predictable . obviously , i was discussing the entire article , which is making that argument . it is generally bad form to quote an entire post when it reaches such length .	0

yes , but gays would also want laws changed to accomodate <allcaps> their </allcaps> form of marriage as well . the fact that one requires less change than the other should not matter , should it ? should having to do more reworking of laws and more paperwork hinder the pursuit of equality ? it seems to me your argument boils down to " polygamy requires more work to make the laws accomodate it . " yeah - - such is the price for marriage equality . let us face it - - if society really wanted to make marriage an open - ended institution of equality rather than for opposite - sex couples which comprise most relationships , they could pull it off - - polygamy , gays , letting 17 year olds marry , etc . all those civil servants are there and can do it as directed as legislation is changed . means could be set up to determine inheritance , for example . laws can be worded to do it .	0

incorrectly by those who do not understand evolution . talking about the evolutionist theories about the big bang is pretty mindless , since the big bang is cosmology . whether or not there was or was not a big bang is irrelevant to evolutionary biology . lumping other sciences under " evolution " is a method of creationists so that they can claim that they do not oppose " science " but only evolution . to be a creationist is to reject the last 400 years of science - cosmology , astronomy , astrophysics , nuclear physics , geology , paleontology , tectonics , biogeography , genetics , population genetics , and so on . you get the idea .	0

because if evolution cannot explain all changes it is false , unless you propose some creatures evolved and some were specially created . is that what you mean ? genesis says that all creatures were specially created . it fits with the observational evidence but there is no smoking gun that proves it . statis is the norm not the exception . one is right the other wrong . it cannot be both ways . do you have an answer to how a lizard can morph into a bird considering the amazing difference in the lungs ?	0

the logic we use to make statements about reality is derived from the way we observe material things behaving , and that logic is not immutable . quantum physics demonstrates the fundamentally uncertain nature of reality at very tiny scales : the ' law of excluded middle ' in particular taking it firmly in the shorts . given that logic can vary on such a simple metric as physical scale , your argument is starting to look more than a bit frayed at the edges <happy>	0

well , i can not speak for anyone else , but i support any choice that the woman wants to make . no , i do not support forced abortions anywhere , i do not support what ' s going on in china and india because they are still taking a choice away from the women . what i do not get is that many prolifers think that prochoicers are <allcaps> only </allcaps> for the choice of abortion . all the prochoicers i know support any choice the woman feels right about making . for example , i was called a hypocrite because i am prochoice and pregnant . the person said " you are forcing others to abort while you carry to term .

this argument is self - defeating . a theory is not a fact , no matter how much evidence may support the theory . bad wording . but again , if you claim something as a fact , you must have proof , verified in both your method of reasoning , and the reasoning utilized by the person you are proving the fact to .	0
so what is it that is not true ? are you saying nasa did not spend 12 billion dollars developing a zero gravity pen or that russia did not use a pencil ? and since you are so anal about a simple joke , go ahead and support your claim that anything my joke says is not true , with actual evidence . your opinion does not carry much weight with me .	1

ah i see . so we take away the right of someone to do with their own body what they want to , unless they pay the government more money ? sound a little too much like bribery to you too ? and how would clamping down on hard drugs be a good thing ? how about we concentrate on the real crimes in our society , and let people kill themselves / ruin their lives if they want to . why should i be spending tax dollars ( ok , well hypothetically , pretend i pay taxes ) to force someone else to not hurt themselves ? sound a little counter - productive ? and then we complain about a defecit ?

is hillary clinton a truthful politician ? perhaps ' truthful politician ' is an oxymoron . if her robust commentary on the iranian regime is not just an attempt to appease ( some ) republican sentiment in her bid for the presidency , then she should state what ' clear and unequivocal ' policy she recommends that the united states should adopt in order to deal with the threat from iran . i do not think she will make clear what aggressive option she favours , if any - at least during her presidential campaign - on the grounds that it might offend ( some ) democratic sentiment . james .	1

it ' s not a state ' s issue from a gay rights perspective , if the supreme court of the us rules that discrimination of same - sex couples is illegal in marriage , as it did for inter - racial couples . what would this proposed new contract that resembles marriage , be called ? we already have such a contract . there ' s no need to totally re - invent the wheel at this particular time . foundit is correct . it ' s telling that this issue only comes up when people are looking for a way to not recognize gay couples in marriage .	0

of course i know that i could be wrong but i would have to be proven wrong through rational arguement , not just claims . have you ever stopped to think that perhaps you could be wrong ? either way , we already discussed this issue of whether people can have opinions about abortion law . perhaps you are having a ' senior moment ' and do not remember our discussion . i really do not feel like repeating this whole discussion all over again for your benefit . indeed , you do seem to repeat your questions quite often . if you do not like someone ' s answer , do not just repeat the question - address their answer . if you do not remember our discussion , it started pretty much around post <hashtag> 861 </hashtag> . unless you have something new to say that we did not already discuss , then i think we pretty much covered it and left it at a disagreement .	0

simone , read the sentence again please . it was " saving lives is " not just " a republican goal .

pregnancy is always harmful to the woman ' s body . however , if the pregnancy is desired then the changes are welcomed by the woman . to a woman who does not want to be pregnant then those changes are very unwelcome and are a bad thing . pregnancy is always harmful , but the perception of what is happening changes depending on the woman . you do not understand that whether or not pregnancy harms the woman ' s body is objective , but whether or not the woman wants the pregnancy anyway depends on the woman . you are mixing the two .	0

i do not find it surprising . it ' s probably a strategic sacrifice on their part rather than a change in their personal views . they do not want to lose votes and possible support from gun owners for their priorities like health care reform because of a difference of opinion on gun control policy . they know that the republicans are going to hit them with everything they have got during election time and exaggerated accusations about the democrats wanting to take away people ' s guns would hurt them . the republicans learned during the clinton years that creating as much as paranoia as possible about the democrats supporting big government is the way to regain a majority in congress . it ' s all politics .	0

marriage is social support . the government , in supporting marriage , is giving social support to certain relationships covered by marriage . you argue marriage should be left up to the culture institutions such as churches , government should only do the paper work . that ' s an acknowledgment of the current social role of government recognized marriage . you do not want government to provide that social support , suddenly , now that it will include gays . oh yes , it speaks to the cultural relevence of government - recognized marriage . people would not feel sufficiently compelled to change the constitution over a matter of meaningless government paperwork which has no social relevence .	0
as was pointed out in some of your own quotations , survival is not an ' end ' of natural selection . natural selection is the differential reproductive success of organisms with more favorable suites of characteristics . it is a statistical tendency . individual organisms may work to survive , but they also work to reproduce . that ' s as close as it gets to " purpose . " and as you know , darwin ' s favored term was natural selection . he never used the phrase " survival of the fittest " without also making a reference to natural selection . the opposite is not the case . since darwin ' s time " survival of the fittest " has been rejected by evolutionary biologists because it is such a poor representation of the extent of the theory .	0

you have some good points here , but what do you do in the event of pregnancy due to rape ? or a pregnancy that is going to put the life of the mother at risk ? and to push the line a bit further , what about failed contraception , where the ' morning after ' pill is taken ? does that count as abortion as it happens after conception ? smiley	0

yeah , it does have risk unlike the embryonic stem cells , but i think that if it comes out the way they hope , it will eventually lead to more embryonic uses as well when people realize that this can have risks . i think it is good to have this way as a back up while people argue over the use of cells that would otherwise be disposed , and get some treatment to people who need it rather than letting it be denied to them by anti - abortionists . and yeah , it ' s pretty much guaranteed that someone will find something to object about , claiming it is immoral ( maybe it will now be that these stem cells are potential human life and we can not use them emoticonxrolleyes ) , but it will likely not have as many objections .	0

first of all , it ' s not a precedent . this is the seventh or eighth state where a higher court has found anti - gay discrimination in marriage unconstitutional . secondly , when so many rulings go in this direction , it can hardly be called " lawlessness " . it ' s a call for lawful , constitutional interpretation of statutes . it takes extraordinary intellectual dishonesty to pretend there is some " agenda " at work . these decisions are the consequence of two things : our long history of rationally applying those silly words about equality that folks smarter than this generation of politicians put in the constitution <allcaps> and </allcaps> a long - term correction of the misunderstandings of what homosexuality is and what its consequences are . i know you do not personally believe it , but there is nothing wrong with us .	0

it would be ' an ' analogy , but like the language analogy , it has its limitations . it is interesting to note that creationist computer software developers / programmers cannot seem to agree on the implications of ' mutations ' when using such analogies - one such person , c.k. lester , declared that computer programs can accumulate up to 30% ' random change ' , just like <allcaps> dna </allcaps> ( hypothetically ) can , therefore , the computer analogy is a good one . but programmer r . david pogge declares that even a single altered bit in a line of computer code a million bits in length would destroy it .	0

but you have not looked . you may claim that your god did it , and no evidence to support or deny that can be offered . the assertion relies on miracle and has no suporting evidence . but when you start talking about how your god did it , your claims can be debunked by facts . certainly the mythology of ancient nomadic herdsmen is not accurate . if you look at the world and the history of the world the is evident in the geologic strata , then you can see that the earth is very old , and you can see a succession of organisms through time . when considered with other fields of science from genetics to biogeography to physiology and anatomy , evolution becomes apparent .	0

well i am not arguing that this is adaptation . <repeated> i have never said that . <repeated> what i am saying is the environment - - in this case diet is the cause for these traits to emerge in offspring . <repeated> but like i said earlier toe does not admit that the diet or any enviornmental variable can influence traits in offspring . traits are dictated by genes and genes are closed off from the enviornment . this is the basic dogma of weismann ' s barrier . i am not necessarily calling this evolution . <repeated> i am just simply pointing out that acquired traits can be inherited . there is no other way to describe this other than lamarckism . do you disagree that the inheritance of acquired characteristics is simply changes in physiology acquired over the life of an organism that are transmitted to offspring ?	0
the argument has nothing to do with whether the bible is true or not , and everything to do with how certain concepts and interpretations are deduced from reading a piece of literature . i am not arguing that i believe in a rapture , but rather that there is biblical support for a rapture event . i hope you see the difference	0
if the only choices we can possibly make are the one god approves , then we dont have free will , because we cannot free choose the option that god does not approve of , which means we are forced to only choose the options that god approves of . this is not free will	0
actually , that ' s not true . while all of the sciences actually support one another , one can be a chemist and not accept evolution . one can even do good science without accepting evolution , but it is difficult . for example , cosmology , astrophysics and astronomy see a very old universe . that ' s not compatible with young earth creationism . geology finds an old earth , wich is not compatible with the mythologies of sacred writings . but that is not to say that one cannot be a qualified scientist and a deist or a theist . there are lots of good christian scientists who accept evolution .	0

why do conservatives support conservatives ? paul ' s theology found favor with the christians that won amongst the early churches . paul was not considered an apostle by the original 11 and barnabas . luke does not have him meet a risen jesus only paul says he did . his first missionary trek was a failure and the next two he was not equal with barnabas . but the apostles did not teach the same as paul , similiar but not the same .	0

that is what it said . now your website gives a false translation to this . it clearly is talking about if the unborn is harmed . not to mention the numerous other quotes i gave you about how a person ( in the christian faith ) is formed before conception ! this shows that god has already created you . god also talks about how you can not kill a person he created . this is an easy concept to follow . i suggest if you wish to learn what the bible says you read it and not take what a biased website has to say . religioustolerance . org is a joke that misleads people into making god what they want him to be .	0

along with some others here , you have missed the point . i know we all have the ability to file extensions for various reasons . i do not really care how much money they have . more power to them for being filthy rich . a candidate for president is supposed to reveal his ( and spouse ' s ) tax returns . teresa has apparently asked for an extension just to have it revealed after the convention . why ? is there anything to hide that would hurt kerry ' s chances of even being nominated ? this has nothing to do with the average citizen .	0

so your claim that no pre - existing belief is necessary is untested by you . do you have an example of an actual non - believer having a religious experience that made a believer of them ? in my experience god never appears to atheists . funny that .	1
let me explain this to you . you want to stop abortions for someone else . you want to take a womans right to choose away . where as jito supporting a womans right to choose does not impose upon your life in any way . you want to stop me from being able to marry this does not effect your life in any way yet has a devastationg effect on my life . the left supports rights while your side want to limit the rights of others . you want to stop me from being able to marry because you have a religious belief against it even though i may have a religious belief that supports it . therefore you are imposing your religious and moral views on me when i do not share those beliefs .	0

but himps living in the jungle were in competition with other himps which did not migrate to the plains . and pressures from predators , climate and changes in the ecosystem should have continued to force the need or desire to control their environment as our line of himp grew to do . my point is that with all of the same basic tools to start out with such as fingers , opposable thumbs and walking upright , there is no reason why only our line evolved to the level that human beings have attained with the same hundreds of millions of years , and the same pressures pushing us all forward , or towards extinction .	0
fend not really . they took it out because it was a blatant pro - christian argument . and those two threads only serve to prove my point . the only iders are fundamentalists christians or muslims . there is no science in id . only godiddit . explain to me how the same processes that date geological areas that are used by evolution and the big fossil fuel corporations is wrong . explain to me how its correct when the fossil fuel industry uses it to find fossil fuels but when scientists use it to support evolution , it ' s false . that makes no sense whatsoever . explain to me why something tried and true needs to be reformatted . or are all these products science brought us fake ? the delusion of creation .	1

what extended family interference ? even mass same - sex marriages can not get ss benefits . you should research joint tenants in common becasue that is not true that is not a gaornment decision . that is a business decision . businesses can decide to allow it if they want to , so marriage would not change that . i am saying what can not you do without it . not about marriages in mass . also the federal government would not recognize it anyways because of defense of marriage act . so far you have not named one yet . also as couples you do not have that right but individually you have the rights as any citizen . calling me full of * * * * while i just showed you have you are wrong . <repeated> funny .	0
this is rather naive . who would willing condemn themselves to hell ? many people commit sins regardless of the punishment . here ' s a little conversation to save time . <repeated> i understand texas has the death penalty . are there any muders still going on ? yes . why ? who would condemn themselves to death ? some people do not think they are going to get caught . they do not want to die themselves , but they just plain think what they do , they can get away with .	0

up to a point , but ther are things some people would consider ' wrong ' that others would not . for example , most muslims would consider drinking alcohol to be wrong , while most non - muslims would not . some people believe it is wrong to hit someone , whether or not they have hit you , others believe you have a right to retaliate . some believe that sex is a big deal and should be reserved only for marriage , others believe any activity between consenting adults is morally ok . all of these are moral issues . which view should schools teach ? should they teach that killing people is wrong ? how about stealing ? should they put things in context , so that stealing is only wrong in a society that recognises personal property . should they conflate morality with law ? that opens yet another can of worms .	0

based on what ? you admit there were 800,000 abortions performed in 1973 but yet if you dared to check the fertility rate between 1972 to 1973 it is nearly static ; meaning there were just as many people giving birth before and after roe . surely , 800,000 potential births being aborted would have cut the fertility rate sharpely but it did not . you do not have to be a rocket - scientist to speculate what this means ; that just as many women were having abortions between 1972 - 1973 and roe v wade only changed who was performing these abortions . <repeated> not whether people were having them or not .	0
very sad news . i am gonna have to say that if i was talking to the assemblyman that they quoted said that to my face , i ' d tell the little bigot that his filthy viewpoint sounds exactly like the arguments used against interracial marriage , against civil rights for blacks , women , and various minorities , and also against ending slavery .	0
interesting . <repeated> have you ever been to a schoolyard recently ? i think the " taunts " are more directed at gays . like " f <user> " and " fairy " . what taunts do you get on a daily basis ? what . <repeated> being called out on your negativity towards the rights of a minority ? boo hoo .	1

is this the pro - sodomite woman talking here ? where does it say in the bible that defending carnal iniquity and sodomy makes one feel squeaky clean like you claim to be ? where does jesus then say that defending carnal iniquity and sodomy is something that he and god approve of ? obviously you have created a carnal , iniquity - loving jesus that ' s different than the jesus of the bible . one more time now , preppy : where does jesus say that defending carnal iniquity and sodomy is something that he and god approve of ? got a scripture where he says gay sex sin suddenly became a righteous endeavor ? obviously you have created a carnal , iniquity - loving jesus that ' s different than the jesus of the bible . so go preach that trash to someone who ' s buying it .	1
i have never heard a conservative who was pro gay let alone pro same sex marriage . do you know of any ? there is an old term that seems to apply ' if the shoe fits ' . please i would like to know who these conservatives are that want gay people to be able to legally marry . who are they ? since as you say i speak in generalities then you should have no problem listing these pro gay or por gay marriage conservatives . just because someone believes that the government should not be in the marriage busisness , as a libertarian , does not mean they support gay marriage .	1
to you , it may be an incorrect statement . but if it is , you have to tell me what it is you kill and take the life away from when you abort the zygote . not knowing if it is being killed or not knowing someone wants to kill it makes no difference . injustice is still practiced there , and not even some abortion doctors realize it .	0
you really need to stop reading such biased , uninformed digital - age fishwrapper . i can think of at least one instance off the top of my head , justice alito ' s confirmation . the democrats threatened to filibuster bush ' s scotus choice . the gang of seven democrats agreed not to filibuster in return for the republicans not to use the ' nuclear option ' . it was in all of the papers . i am surprised that the leftwing rag missed it . emoticonxrolleyes	1

oh really ? science does not say ' we dont know x , y , z , but we want to know x , y , z , and so we observe x , y , z , and come up with our conclusions and claim it to be true , or not ?

i am a little surprised by this . the polls i have seen show that mass voters favor gay marriage . i would have thought that getting those who oppose it to put their opposition on the record before the elections would be beneficial . then again , seeing as how the lies and fear mongering have already started , i can see how they might want to avoid having the elections muddied with the inevitable dirty fighting that would be thrown at them . not the most couragous stance , but perhaps safer in the long run . you are right that the longer society fails to collapse the more inane the doomsayers seem .	0

well , you ignored the part where i said ' voting ' . but imo legislative solutions are part and parcel to popular appeal because legislators are voted in on that basis . any legislator claims to ' do what ' s right .

okay , my computer is too slow to go search some statistics and copy the url to try and defend my opinion ; but , here is my opinion anyway . one reason there are so many crimes against women , or crimes in general , is that offenders are repeat offenders much of the time . how many times have you heard of a child molester being released from prison and repeating the crime ? there is not much determent to crime when criminals are put in jail for a year and on their first parole hearing are released back on the street to repeat offenses . i do not know what the answer is - - but i think that is the reason there are so many crimes , especially sex crimes .	0

honestly , i am amazed , so there are actually gay people with a sense of reason . i have spent years of facing discrimination from narrow minded homosexual activists and all these years later , you are the only one that has ever demonstrated somewhat of a sense of reason beyond the same old hogwash i have seen demonstrated by thousands i have interacted with . i still have my reservations towards suspecting that somehow you might be attempting to set me up for a slam .	0

well then , my skeptic fellow australians , what is the answer to the question ? do any of you guys here know ? i sure as hell do not . creationists did not misquote dawkins because the words came from his mouth . and dawkins is a professional at biology , but he could not answer such a question . in the little amount of fossils that we do see , they are not evolutionary . there is no clear cut fossils showing the evolution of man , is there . by " true human " i mean they were just like us , just varients of human kind that we have today - looked human , walked like us , most likely were quite intelligent . i have got to go to school , continue this later .	0

because that the law one has to presume and of course the law applied to that specific case . as to it being contradictory - well the law is loaded with contradictions if you look at all closely . on the other hand consider that the driver killed the woman <allcaps> and </allcaps> obviously damaged her fetus beyond recovery - <allcaps> without </allcaps> the consent of the woman . in other words the death of the fetus was not by consent of the person who holds the right to decide but rather by the negligence or intent of the guilty party . and yes prior to her death ( assumming all other requirements were met ) she could have <allcaps> at her choice </allcaps> and un - <allcaps> coerced </allcaps> have chosen to abort the fetus without incurring a legal penalty . but that would of course be much different .	0

i do not understand why people are stuck in this mindset that we have to define <allcaps> all </allcaps> abortions as either right or wrong . in between , there is the option of calling abortion under certain circumstances as right or wrong or calling abortion in certain trimesters as right or wrong . why limit yourself to the extreme views ? i do not believe that the original post asked for an absolute answer , just a survey of opinions . after all , as you say , abortion is not math and there is no one answer that everyone might agree with . however , the question of people ' s opinions on the beginning of personhood and how it relates to the morality of abortion lies at the very core of the debate on abortion rights . really . <repeated> what other question is more relevant ?	0
fine . thank you . what im hearing is that you believe attila should act in accordance with the prevailing moral consensus . how do you define the moral consensus ? in attilas case , would that be among the huns ? among the hun ruling elite ? or should attila act in accordance with a wider consensus of which he ( for the sake of argument ) has no intimate knowledge ? now why should he act in accordance with the consensus ? this is not completely clear to me . so , do you take the position that moral sentiments are learned ?	0
well , this gets rather complicated . a very young child does not get to choose his or her adoptive parents . who decides on who adopts whom depends on the kind of adoption and the policies of the particular adoption system . in private domestic adoption , the birth mother usually gets to decide on who will adopt her baby . the foster care system is organized differently , and international adoption is different still and depends on the country from which the child is being adopted . so it ' s pretty much impossible to generalize about adoption policies and practices . they vary greatly . the point is that the purpose of adoption is to protect the rights of the child .	0

no it means that the genome operates in a more complex way than was previously believed . it does not mean that " life is irreducibly complex " since that term is not even sufficiently well defined to test the assertion . and given the scattering of information into many pieces i would say that more and more it looks like " pieces that happen to be fitted together " . more and more like a complex kludge . exactly what one might expect to find in an evolved system rather than a designed or deliberate or intentional one !	0
yes because it is " officially " a life . whether a person believes in life at conception or not they all agree it is life at birth and half way through life it is still life and right before death it is still life . if she does not want the child she can refrain from sex , use a contraceptive or abortion . if he does not want it he can refrain from sex ( not likely for men ) , use a condom ( not a guarantee to work ) , have surgery ( hard to reverse ) but that is it . so if he was to use a condom and get her pregnant she still has the last option .	0

simple answer ? dc has a lot less budget than the usa government . more complex answer ? just looking at the commuters , there are over 400,000 people that come to work in dc every day ( see link in my last post ) . making the preposterous assumption that they all come in at a constant flow , just looking at 400,000 of them and assuming that you would only check them coming in , that ' s ~ 4.6 people admitted per second for every second of the working week . good luck with that . good luck with convincing people that it ' s constitutional , as well - airports get away with it , but only because there is such a ( largely unfounded ) fear of death by terrorist that they can get away with something which is constitutionally shady . a quick search gave me two relevant results almost immediately .	0
it is silly to focus on the tools and not bad people who misuse these tools , especially when the tools in question can be easily smuggled as well as made in a modestly - equipped machine shop . also , why do many of those who supposedly have a political orientation that favors freedom and opposes tyranny want to severely and arbitrarily limit the rights of tens of millions of people who have not , and show no indication of wanting to , unjustly hurt anyone with these tools ? it is wrong to tell people that they cannot put certain substances in their bodies and have abortions , just as it is wrong to tell people that they cannot have certain precision - machined metal / polymer / wood objects in their own homes .	0
what about all of the school killings that have involved use of revolvers , shotguns , and ieds ? what ' s your p***ing <censored> away excuse for instances like these ? in reality school shootings are linked to them being target rich environments where nobody can mount any opposition to the deranged killer . it ' s like a wolf in the chicken coop .	1
yes peeling ; you say this with such assurance , yet what you can not explain with any assurance is why only one offshoot of the primate genus evolved into what human beings are today . why only us , when we all allegedly started in the same environment with the same ecosystems putting the same pressures on us . what i am saying is that in every place where our alleged primate ancestors fossils have been found , so have not the fossils of animals described as lower primates been found . so your explanation that one species evolved while another stagnated or died out rings hollow with me . especially since you can actually prove absolutely none of this . can not you see that peeling ? none of this is provable .	0
yep , so much for a pastor knowing his sheep ( le ) . it ' s no wonder that they are not noticed when they go missing . what ever happened for the shepherd going out and seeking his lost sheep to bring them back to the fold ? <repeated> as to this case . i mentioned earlier about rick warren ( author of a purpose driven life ) . <repeated> he does not have armed guards in his mega church . but , then again , he ' s not a fleecing woff in shepherds clothing who seeks to ravenously devour a flock .	1
well , those who keep using that story can not see the real sins of those cities . they are so sure that it was rampent homosexuality which lead to their destruction . even though we know that before the angels were ever sent god had spelled out why he was going to destroy them . he sent the angels because they promiced to find even one righteous man . they failed in that because the angels were attacked for being foreigners . noone who abuses this story is ever going to admit this fact . they can not see past the supposed homosexual issue .	0

would you mind telling us just how he determined <allcaps> all </allcaps> maladaptive or inconsequential mutations in his test organism and just how he validated such measurements ? to me as a biologist with quite a bit of microbiology under the belt it would seem to be impossible to do so ! after all its very likely that a fairly large portion of the populutaion will have at least one mutation at at least one base pair location in the total sequence ! your claim would seem to be impossible , but perhaps there is a way he managed to do so .	0

like i said in another thread , the argument i hear most often from so - called ' pro - choicers ' is that you cannot legislate morality . well then what can you legislate ? every law in existence is legislation of morality ! by that way of thinking , then we should have no laws . if someone kidnaps and murders your 3 - year - old child , then let us hope the murderer goes free because we cannot legislate morality !	1

actually , there is no such thing as " an evolutionary mutation of a gene . " a mutation is a mutation . for evolution to have occurred requires neither that a mutation be new nor useful and they do not require new structures nor structures . here ' s a little mental exercise for you . at most , a person can have only two alleles for any gene . this would have been the condition of the human race 6,000 years ago according to creationists . it would not have been possible for there to be more than 2 alleles for any given gene . now consider that for every gene in the human genome there is an average of 14 different alleles , sometimes more , sometimes less . where did all of those alleles come from ?	0

no it does not . that ' s why darwin objected to the use of that phrase in reference to his theory . those who do not bother to learn the theory tend to misunderstand . fittness is not a reference to big and strong . it makes it too easy to misrepresent evolutionary theory . i will state it again since you seem to have missed or ignored it the first time . natural selection is differential reproductive success . those organisms that are well adapted to their environment tend to survive to reproduce in greater numbers , and therefore they tend to leave more offspring , than those organisms that are less well adapted . you have got to be a pretty shallow thinker to equate an environmental advantage with big and strong .	0

here we go dan . your problem with the law is not whether its fair or not , its whether you can benefit personally from it . you have no problem with abortion because your not going to be the victim of such a law , but youd definitely have a problem if you were the one suffering from the law . apparently you dont care if the law disadvantages or is unfair to others , as long as it does not hurt you , you are ok with it .	0

your reason for believing this lies entirely within the bible . i hardly consider a 1500 year old book " making clear what he wants " . particularly given that even among those who believe the book , they still can not agree on what god wants . and of course , that does not even beging to address the issue of all the other holy books which contradict the christian bible . you may personally believe that you know what god wants , but if so it ' s not because god has been clear about it .	0

sure , no doubt . but , there are ways to be absolutely 100% sure that you do not get pregnant . the obvious way is not to have sex , but i know you will not settle for abstinance as an answer . that ' s way too religious for this site i suppose . obviously i cannot propose that no one have sex unless they want children . if someone does not want to ever have children and is willing to undergo an operation ( abortion ) to remove the possibility , why can they not simply have a different operation before practicing casual sex ? this is true within marriage as well .	0

is that a trick question ? no , the tabloid and other gutter press keep going on about how bad it is , because they sell papers by fanning fear and hatred , and fear of crime is one of their biggest markets . yes there has been an increase in gun crime over the years , but that ' s largely attributable to increased attractiveness of crime in a society where social mobility has come to a standstill . in any case the number of incidents where firearms are used in crime is still very small , which is why every time someone gets shot it is headline news . guns are incredibly rare in this country , the only time i have seen guns in real life ( other than air rifles ) is on a military base .	0
yes . it ' s not logical to simply cite , " the bible tells me so , the bible was written by god , " and consider that an argument . the bible has been wrong . it ' s also not logical to cite authority to god . it necessarily begs further questions about your god ' s unproven existence to those who do not believe in that god , or in any god . if we do not simply believe in your god , on the basis of your presupposition , he can have no authority over the rest of us . one must come up with another argument . should each religion have it ' s own definition or completely different idea of logic , which favours that religion and its god ?	0

jessica , all these problems you have listed , the human body takes care of automatically and remarkably well . the fact still remains that only less than 5% of all abortions occur because the risk is great enough to be deemed life - threatening to either tha mother or the child . and that percentage is diminishing as well . the overwhelming majority of abortions occur simply because the woman decides she does not wnat to be a mother .	0

actually , it can be proven whether leprechauns , unicorns , the flying spaghetti monster , magical space monkeys and livining care baers , and even god , exists or not . the question of proving a belief seems kinda self - contradictory to me . if something is a fact that can be proven , then your belief about it is irrelevant . likewise , if you believe something , whether there are facts to support it or not , its still your belief . there are people who believe things inn the absence of supporting facts , and sometimes even in the face of opposing facts . the term for that is faithfaith is the belief of something in the absence of evidence . if you have faith in something , proof is irrelevant , or at least it should be	0
well if you already know you are for guns , then you should know the basic reasons , right ? or was this an uninformed decisions ( i heard from my friend that guns are good ) ? but basically other people have said it . they are protected by the constitution , they generally result in lower crime rates , and they can be used for defense as well as hunting . oh , but the burden of proof is not on the people supporting guns , but those who wish to ban guns . most arguments for banning guns are easily refutable .	1

i think this is a fair conclusion . i went as far as i did because of what it seems to say about the governor calling for a joint session . i may be wrong , but the text seems to instruct the governor to keep them in joint session until final action is taken . in other words , it does not appear that the governor has an option . and it does not seem that the constitution allows for a legislative session that never ends . i am not sure how else to square the two except that the legislature should pursue final action . of course , as you have pointed out , it really is hard to speculate on this one without any historical context of the amended amendment process , and / or the relevant legal precedent surrounding it . any thoughts on this ?	0

your problem is that you take the bible as the literal word of the invisible man which everyone with a brain knows it is <allcaps> not </allcaps> . there are other " sins ' listed in the old testament that you ignore and try to explain away but you know as well as i that jesus did not change the laws . if you want others to live by your false book of fairy tales it would be a good idea for you to read it and follow it yourself first . choosing one or two scriptures and using them to attack people is only making you look foolish .	1
oh dear , you are back to your nasty ad hominem self . i could have made fun of the fact that you do not know about materialism , and how its a major force behind evolution . which is itself a suggestion that you are unaware of the socio - political forces driving western evolutionary theory . * * the issue is about people behind sciences , making many different ' sciences ' ; based on bias , cultural / political / historical . ' peer ' does not mean anything because ' peers ' are just people with the same background / bias etc . i notice you did not touch upon nationalist sciences . or for that matter , capitalist science . * you mean ' understanding ' written english . * * i say ' western ' because there are other evolutionary theories - marxist , nazi , feminist etc . thank you , come again .	0

there is one major difference between the democratic spending plans and the republican plan ( for this election cycle anyway ) : dems want to repeal the tax cuts , so they have a methodology for paying for all of this . oh , and they have not been too keen on sending men to mars either . and just a quick aside , was it legal to invade iraq ? probably , b / c of the legislation broker cites . but i think he makes a logical leap when he extrapolates ' justified ' from ' legal . ' the calculus used to say this was a ' just ' war is a very dangerous one , and if cross - applied could justify innumerable conflicts ( how many nations can legitmately say that another nation has ' dangerous activities ' that make it pose an ' imminent threat ' ? at the very least , the entire mid - east ( arab / israel ) would explode under that logic ) .	0

how did you private insurer determine the coverage in your plan ? do they ever make case - by - case determinations not to cover something ? i strongly urge you not only to read the house bill and the upcoming senate bill , but also to read your own health insurance plan , in detail , fine print and all , as well as to look into their record of denying claims . it ' s one of those things that most people do not realize is a problem until it affects them directly , at which point it ' s too late .	0

actually , the process of fossilisation is not slow and can be done relatively quickly . all what you need is for sediments to quickly cover a dead ( or an alive body - as what would have happened to noah ' s flood ) and hence , fossilsation can occur rapidly ; evolutionarly speaking , fossils take millions of years to fossilise a bone , but unless the bone is covered by sediments quickly , the bone will never fossilise .	0

i suspect that you are thinking of birds . but early birds had fingered claws on those wings . it is generally true that no organ ever springs into existance completely developed where nothing existed before . the wings of bats , birds , and pterodactyls are merely the modified fore - limb of a tetrapod . there is evidence that insect wings may have arisen from some sort of thermal panel . and of course , size has considerable relevance to flight . wingless spiders fly by spinning a loop of silk that is carried by the moving air . very small insects require almost no wings to fly . what they do is more similar to a whale in water than a bird in air . if by chance , a small animal is upsized because of a competetive advantage , and the wings are too , then it becomes a larger flying animal .	0
hmm <elongated> , the employment , housing , and accommodation thing is really state based and for employment i am pretty sure every state does not allow you to ask about sexual orientation . as for marriage . <repeated> anyone is allowed to marry ( so long as they are of age ) . you just have a problem with the definition of marriage . as for the military thing . <repeated> seems like a complicated issue . where does a gay man shower for example ? the womans bathroom ? there own special bathroom ? the mens bathroom ? other issues involving relationships could arise as well . as for the adoption thing . <repeated> only florida does not allow it outright .	0

oh yeahrubbish rubbish , scientifically speaking , human life ( using a most bsic term ) begins at conception . the twins exist as two seperate entities the moment each contains the individual human dna . seems to me you better be certain when it begins before you go around ending it . if you are driving at night an you " think " you might see a person ahead in the middle of the road you are hopefully not gonna drive over that person . instead that uncertainty should lead you to stop . if you dont like that example , consider a hunter who is unsure what is in the bushes .	0

ah , historical inevitability . i had no idea you were a marxist , steve <elongated> ! unfortunately for you the same argument applies to the collapse of capitalism . and once again you conflate capitalism and freedom . have you never heard of anarcho - syndicalism ? and why is someone more free when their life is controlled by corporations than when those corporations are restrained by a democratic government ?	1
you bring up a very interesting point . all those state level marriage amendments which were voted on also made civil unions illegal as well . when polled , residents in those areas were actually unaware that the amendments also outlawed civil unions . so , not only are the anti ' s disingenuous as far as what they promoted , but were so in <allcaps> how </allcaps> these amendments were promoted .	0

stevens said that bear arms has a military meaning . so was he saying that the right is individual but existed in connection with militia service ? is this some kind of hybrid model ? interestingly , scholars who made similar claims in the past got lumped in with those who supported a collective right by the pro gun crowd . but i suppose it sounds good to say that all nine supreme court justices supported an individual rights interpretation .	0
did he say it should only be lowered for gay relationships ? probably not . are there straight people who would advocate for changing the age of consent ? yes . there are different arguments for and against lowering the age of consent which have nothing to do with gay equality rights .	0
because , when each is in its natural habitat , they are reproductively isolated .	0
obviously not . if the right to life trumps all other rights , then it follows that the mother ' s right to life and the child ' s right to life cancel each other out . mind you , if it ' s her choice then the pro - life movement endorses such heroism , right ?	0
well that may be your contention , but medically that is not necessarily true . maybe being gay does not mean you are suicidal or depressed , but there is more of it going on in the gay life than in the hetero . that in itself is a wake up call . depression and suicide are harmful , even if it does not touch you personally . if it were as simple as you say the <allcaps> apa </allcaps> would not be re - evaluating " reorientation therapies " would they and with positive critiques too . you would not have prominent gay activists like camile paglia deriding the gay community for being malcontent when those unhappy with being gay seek and desire the way to be hetero .	0

really ? congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; sounds like a requirement to be neutral to me . it could be rephrased : ' do not meddle with religion ! do not regulate . neither promote nor inhibit . ' why would anyone have a problem with this ? and we both know that the limitation of government regulate of rights and liberties is read today , thanks to the 1 4 th amendment , as applying to all legislative authorities in the us , not just congress . no state legislature can establish a state religion either .	0
yes , but the statement directly contradicts proponents of " creation science " and of id . their claim is that they are doing science , even though they can not show how . scientists have claimed all along that creationists / iders are doing philosophy and religion , but not science . that is the problem . they never offer any evidence that supports their assertions , only mythology and superstition . but now we have ray admitting that creationism and id are not science and can not be included in science . they either philosophy or theology , but not science .	0
ever see someone try to kill you ? that can causes paranoia also . emoticonxrolleyes	1
just cause you dont buy it doesnt mean it is not true . that life is sacred does provide a ( if not the only ) compelling altruistic basis for and responsibility to social justice whether it is actually walked out or not . i think that the fact that it is not really walked out in america proves that the majority of americans are not pro life ( including a majority of those who actually claim to be pro life ) . this doesnt negate the truth though .	0
invalid argument to assert that mutations can map a road outside of their assigned task in illogical , where would the information to do so come from ? biology works because every individual cell doing what it was created to do along with what the one next to it was , though created to perform another set of instructions creates the molecular change that the combination of the cells together would produce . but there is no additional information there . <repeated> not int he way you assert .	0

true until proven otherwise eh ? xcaliber and you must get along great . you have things backward and you are probably being confused by the ' experiment to falsify a theory ' , that is a tenet of science based on the generalization that untrue theories are easily disproved . no logician ( and by extension no good scientist ) would ever hold a lack of disproof as proof . oh right theories are never proven , so in fact your definition of theory would go something like this - > ' an idea that is not disproved which we assume is true ' .	1

i must be blessed to be surrounded by so many posters with a direct line to god so that they know who is saved or in hell . with christians as well - informed as this , i am surprised god does not just retire and let them take over . after all , 6,000 years since creation must be enough for anyone .	1

the same could be said of clinton . tell me . how do people learn if you insist on covering up these situations ? if a person like sanford is not exposed to his own medicine , how will he ( or others ) not recognize how it tastes ? furthermore , i find your perspective a little baffling . what he said " many years ago " ? is that something he should be embarrassed of , because he was wrong ? or should he be embarrassed cause he got caught ? cause the standard of not cheating on your wife is not a bad standard . it ' s a good standard . we have too many politicians who look out for their own interests , and say things just for political gain not to take it seriously .	0
my hat is off to california ! was my post <hashtag> 43 </hashtag> right or wrong ? now we just need new york to follow suit . now my question . if the federally funded programs can not create new stem cell lines , can california create them and then share ? voila ! federal funding on useful research . then watch ' em all stand in line for the cure . another question . has anybody else thought to ask gwb why , if stem cell research is false hope , did he fund any of it - - badly ?	1
but religion is not a topic for science classes . teach the science in class and if that presents a problem for your religion at home , perhaps you should think about your religion a bit more critically and realistically . what is being attempted is to cast doubt on well established scientific theory and pretend that magic is a viable alternative .	1

i am quite the anti - hypocrisy advocate . as for my personal take , 17 - year olds should not be taking pictures like that . do you disagree ? prejean should not have lied about it . anything beyond that is pointing out hypocrisy . seeing some of hilton ' s work , i do not see why he should be in a position to judge anybody . i think the ' adds a little flavor to a dull contest that no one cares about ' is exactly why he was chosen .	0
that ' s certainly an interesting point . i know next to nothing about global economics , so i will not try to argue here . but i will make a guess that such a thing will never happen as long as we are still a superpower and cling to our beloved dollar . probably we will devolve into just four or five major currencies in the next 50 or so years and leave it at that for a long while . but to stay on topic , i am just wondering why such a thing was brought up as a sign of the end . why would it seem evil to someone living back then ? it ' s an oft - quoted religious statistic that always leaves me scratching my head .	0

so you are asking how a gravitational field overcomes the intertia of a less massive object placed within said field ? i do not know but your question kind of confused me : in this example the only reason the object is not moving is because you are exerting an opposing force to counter that which the warped space has induced on the object ( gravity ) . all that has changed when the object is released is it can accelerate freely and we can observe the resulting notion . i see what you are getting at - the question could be rephrased as how is an object in a region of warped space constantly under an acceleration towards the centre of the gravitional field , the strength of which depends upon the size of the bodies and the distance separating the two ?	0

the concept that science no longer looks at animals boggles my mind . my brother is a wildlife biology major in college meaning his primary focus is . <repeated> looking at animals and their relationships to one another . it is somewhat understandable that your misconception could arise because molecular biology and genetic engineering are the latest crazes in science . the simple fact is most of the big breakthroughs when studying whole animals have been made . a similar turn has occured in chemistry . i could argue that chemists have subtly turned away from chemical reactions . all the research now is about electron orbitals and nano - structures . the reason for this is these are new fields that are relatively young and many scientists are interested in them . i myself am doing research on buckminster fullerenes . it does not mean we have abandoned good old fashioned reactions , we just have more field to play in now .	0

i do not think much can be inferred about the relationship between guns and crime by comparing the crime rate of a densely populated city with the crime rate of a whole state . virginia has a higher homicide rate that most canadian provinces which is probably a better comparison - homicide offences , number and rate , by province and territory is it possible to make it much harder for criminals to obtain guns ? yes , i think so . if your boat is sinking then you have to plug all the leaks not just some of them . if you keep plugging the leaks then eventually you will reach a state in which significantly fewer criminals are obtaining guns . why do i say this ? because significantly fewer criminals are obtaining guns in developed countries with stricter and more consistent gun laws . in the us , there is too much inconsistency in gun laws .	0

creationism is not something new , it was the prevailing view of scientists up until darwin . none of them belived in a divine parrot that is just plain silly . in the crucible of natural science throughout the middle ages , the scientific revolution and well into the 1 9 th century theology was the queen of the sciences . now we subject students to higher math studies that they will most likely never use and speculations about conceptual mechanisms like natural selection that have no practical application . naturalistic presumption has become sacrosanct in the rhetoric of the professional scientists who have been crystal clear on how they define creationism . you can ignore the statement by d.j. futuyma and identical ones made by gould , mayr , dawkins , dobzhansky and others but not without departing from mainstream evolutionary biology .	0

well , what faults ? you say that innocent people are sentenced to death far too often . well , the death penalty does not sentence people , our judiciary system does . the death penalty is mearly a punishment . i will agree that some innocent people have been sent to death row , and when their innocence was discovered , they were released . a perfect judiciary system would not sentence innocent people , and would alleviate all problems with the death penalty . if we had a perfect system and no innocent person was ever sent to death row , we could take them directy from sentencing to a little room beside the courtroom containing a bed and a few drugs , put an iv in them , and carry out the sentence before the jurors got out of the courthouse . of course , we know that our judiciary system is an imperfect thing , so we understand the need for appeals .	0

no it does not . first , the changes may not be neutral . i will presume that you are intelligent enough to grasp that idea the mutations in and of themselves are neither advantagous nor disadvantageous , and the they have no purpose . evolution happens when the mutations ( and other mechanisms that increase genetic diversity ) are acted upon by other mechanisms of evolution . even in natural selection there is no purpose . natural selection is differential reproductive success . some organisms tend to produce more offspring because they have characteristics that give them an advantage in a particular environment .	0

and here is the crux of the matter where i think libertarians are missing it : as one founding father said , " there can be no liberty without virtue . " someone else once said , " intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their bindings " . if the god of the bible is right , a nation which legalizes sin and intemperance loses the favor of god . and when the sins of a nation reach their fullness ( in god ' s eyes ) , that disfavor can turn to judgment ( genesis 15:16 , deuteronomy chapter 28 - " the blessings of obedience and curses of disobedience ) . therefore , while many of the libertarians mean well on liberal social issues , they nevertheless either do not see the big picture , or they do not believe it will occur .	1

the gene and therefore the enzyme it produces . <allcaps> lpl </allcaps> is the designation for a gene that encodes lipoprotein lipase , an enzyme that hydrolyzes lipids in lipoproteins . the actual gene encodes a protein of 475 amino acids that becomes a mature protein of 448 amino acids after cleavage of a signal peptide . one study was able to identify 3 common snps ( single nucleotide polymorphism ) in the coding region of the gene , 2 of which result in small changes in enzyme function in european populations . the third <allcaps> snp </allcaps> converts that locus to a stop codon and results in an enzyme that is 447 amino acids long . thus , the enzyme has been truncated . the resulting enzyme , <allcaps> lpl </allcaps> s447x , is functional . in fact , it results in lower incidence of vascular disease and lower blood pressure . other truncations result in non - functional enzymes .	0

actually , i do not remember that they did . what they did take bets on was that <allcaps> aig </allcaps> would be able to find enough stupid people who would buy into their ignorant and scientifically illiterate tripe . as i recall , most who were actually aware of how stupid creationists can be bet that they would be able to do so . so now , besides their other so called ' peer reviewed ' magazine , they want to pretend that they are doing science here .	0

and as i have already pointed out , this notion that god needs to glorify himself smacks of narcissism on a cosmic scale . why would god in any way need - - or even want - - to demonstrate his glory ? he ' s god : he knows how glorious he is ! is not that enough ? and again , as already pointed out , i do not find arbitrary salvation of an undeserving few to be merciful , nor do i find arbitrary damnation of an undeserving many to be just . the calvinist vision of god strikes me as a celestial tyrant .	0

sure . god commanded faithfulness in marriage . yet he never even raised an eyebrow at abraham inpregnating his maid , and went on to bestow blessings on him like it never happened . god commanded you should not steal . yet moses ' brilliant idea of having the israelites borrow gold and jewelry from the egyptians they knew they never were going to repay seemed mildly humorous to god at the time . god commanded that noone should make graven images of him or anything in heaven . so what ' s the deal with the ark of the covenant ? and the number of instances god commanded his people to kill , shortly after commanding them not to kill , well this could become a pretty long post . i know you asked for one , but i just started rambling because so many came to mind . pick one if you want .	1
apparently this is a petition opposing the pending resolution before the illinois lawmakers that will deprive the rights given in the constitutions . it is to encourage the lawmakers to vote against it . the lawmakers have not yet agreed to vote it down . knowing the state of illinois , i am predicting they will pay no attention to the commoners . the only thing a glean out of this is that the common people have more sense than the lawmakers . but i have actually known that for a long time .	0

the difference , eddie is simply this . if the constitution needs to be changed , the founders instigated a means to do so . said means is doubly hard as to make sure what is done , has been given much thought and study . the plan afoot today by the gun grabbers is to incrementally usurp the rights of free men , until , the fait accompli has been established . if the right to keep and bear arms , or any of the other rights guaranteed by the constitution are to be abridged , they must ne done so by legal means , i . e . constitutional amendment .	0

actually , i am of the opinion that the fetus has no natural rights of its own . any rights we grant to a person as a citizen or national are granted at the moment of birth . by granting equal rights to a 3 week old fetus that you do to a 20 year old man , you are endangering the rights of the woman who carries that child . yes , i believe that in most circumstances , the child should be carried to term , but there are exceptions to every rule , and i am not quite ready to forsake the lives and health of women to protect unborn children . yes , i think the unborn child is worthy of protection , but not any more so than the mother , in fact probably less .	0

i see a subtle distinction here . creationism is concerned with the spiritual origins of people .

evolution wasn ' t introduced until 1859 . when did abortion become popular ? the industrial revolution occurred in the 1 8 0 0 s . maybe that was the cause of abortion ' s alleged popularity . grover cleveland was elected in the 1 8 0 0 s . clearly he had something to do with the alleged increase in abortion ' s popularity . the american civil war occurred in the 1 8 0 0 s . it must have been the impetus for the rise in popularity of abortion . a human embryo does have features that look like gill slits . they are not gills but pharyngeal clefts . no modern book presents any information that human embryros have gill slits as if it is fact .	0

i know . sad indeed . orion and his liberal ilk make it a habit to come up with these sophomoric ideas . as if jesus ( who is god according to scripture ) would come out and give moses the commandments against gay sex and then turn around and incarnate as a gay man . get real . when the antichrist comes he will probably be gay ( one ot scripture alludes to the antichrist as having no affinity for women , and satan loves to mimic god ' s kingdom with some kind of diabolical twist . ) . then orion will prostrate himself before him and receive him as his long lost savior .	1

well then maybe you can prove it somehow . california has all these laws you support , and even more than that . so if they have these laws on the books and have had them for a while now , and if they are effective at fighting crime , then you must surely have evidence of some sort to prove your case .	0

well said . it is a disgrace that the " flat earth " side of the argument never gets a look in geography lessons and that the " spontaneous creation " side of the argument never gets a look in when teaching kids about the life cycle of insects . do you realise that they refuse to present the " cheese " side of the argument when teaching about the moon these days ? it ' s outrageous , how can our kids get a balanced education if such bias is allowed to continue !	0

however , so much of the sex , in fact , most of the sex that happens , gay or straight , does not lead to reproduction . why is there not the same aversion to oral sex , masturbation , condoms , dating , etc ? . <repeated> no one is saying people who do those things should have fewer rights , be excluded , or should not be equal , provided those people are not gay .	0

well let me put it like this , i consider it your duty because if you do not protect yourself then you basically shift that responsibility to someone else . not only is this incredibly selfish , but 9 out of 10 times the ' protection business ' gets outsourced to the state . this in itself it dangerous because when people decide that a third party like the state ( which has no real accountability ) has control over their lives it can all to easily lead to a situation where the state becomes tyrannical . more people have been killed by their own government than by any foreign government .	0

no , that was not an argument . it was an illustration of a point . the point was this : that in order to stand in moral judgment of god , you would have to be of higher moral character than god . in other words , you would have to be god in order to judge god . now , the point i made is that this is highly unlikely , as any being claiming to be god would not misspell words , no matter how closely the letters are on the keyboard . to be clear , i was not attacking you ( at least i did not intend to ) by calling out your spelling mistake . i was trying to illustrate a point . and the point was this : you are not perfect , and therefore , you are not god . and if you are not god , then you really cannot stand in moral judgment of god .	0
not by any means . evolution works on genetic change that future generations will inherit . adaptation does no such thing . it changes an individual , but not its genes . for example , if my parents volunteered to be part of a scientific experiment where they two additional arms fused onto their body before i was ever conceived , i would not be born with two extra arms . on the other hand , if a genetic mutation made it advantageous to have two additional arms , and both my parents had that mutation , i would be born with both arms .	0
in older times man had more questions without answers than today . some men believed if a god of fire because they did not understand what fire was . because of their misunderstanding they invented an answer , the fire god . today we know exactly what fire is and we do not need to invoke some mythical explanation . today ' s atheists know that there are many other questions we do not have answers for and it ' s ok to simply say we do not know instead of buying into the whole " let us - invent - some - god - to - explain - it " mentality . <repeated>	0

well , signorile certainly did not back up his opinions in this instance . how do you know it ' s the truth ? if it were definitive , i ' d be more inclined to agree . it ' s not ' common knowledge ' that merv griffin was gay , at least not outside of hollywood . i ' d never heard it myself . i do not see how you could know for certain anyone was gay that was in the closet unless they admitted to it or were seen doing something that made it clear they were ( like having sex with someone of the same gender ) . and the idea he should be hold some responsibility for not talking to reagan about aids in the 8 0 s is absolutely opinion .	0
thats a very good question . to be honest - i would prefer no legislation period - but i would not get up in arms about a late term restriction like i described because 1 ) a fetus could very well survive outside of the mom at that point , 2 ) most reputable doctors will not conduct an abortion at that stage without a legitimate medical reason anyway .	0

so lets see , you referred to how the 1 st amendment applied to the states , posted the 1 4 th amendment privileges and immunities clause and then asked if i thought something was unclear . of course the privileges and immunities clause is often mistaken to have incorporated the 1 st amendment by people who do not know what they are talking about but this is merely coincidence because you randomly quoted part of the 1 4 th amendment but implied it all . now if i changed it to what it said above would you feel that is an accurate statement ? probably , considering you do not seem to understand a blatant difference between " original understanding " and " original constitution ) . your pride ruins you my friend .	1

if you want the benefits of marriage , get married . but you ought to be able to marry a person of your choice . your suggestion would be to marry someone i do not want to me married to , that is a different thing . it is not using ' that logic ' . i thought marriage was supposed to mean something to you . is not it supposed to mean a commitment with rights and responsibilities ? i am not proposing that anyone enters into that commitment lightly . i happen to think that ' s a bad idea . people get married for many reasons , some of which i would feel are not good reasons , but i would not make it illegal to do so . i am talking about the right to marry a person of your choosing .	0

then why is it that closeted homosexuals that are completely unknown to be gay commit suicide at such a high rate ? they are not persecuted or harassed at all since no one knows they are even having these feeling ? it is self loathing that feeds their desire to harm themselves . people who know that what they are is right and good , do not harm themselves at all , but defend and support who they are even when persecuted by others . that ' s how it was for me when i converted from islam to christianity . all of the persecution i received just made me stronger .	0

it appears the safety nazis feel gun free zones should be ran like prisons . maybe the safety nazis should take a field trip to their states prison system and ask the guards if guns or any other weapons ever make it into the prisons . prisons are considered gun and drug free zones . if this was true then how can an inmate get shot by a gun in prison ?	1

intelligent design comes in many flavors too . id that submits as a designer something that has any quality of the unknowable is irrational . id that submits we were created / designed by things inside the universe that are knowable are rational claims . however , they have no evidence , so they have a long way to go to be shown to be worthwhile to pursue . even a simple application of occam ' s razor tells us that to suspect a thousand theories on how life has changed on earth is unecessary when another theory can fulfill the description entirely , of life , and they have evidence to support it . it ' s why this theory is discarded onto the heap of any number of theories that simply is not going anywhere . you can make up a theory right now about how life began , but if it cannot be supported by evidence or is redundant to a theory already described . <repeated> why would we ?	0

( you do know what i am talking about , do not you calli ? you do know what a " point mutation " is , do not you ? ) bottom line is that there may be no intermediate between scales and feathers . a single point mutation produces feathers from scales . various kinds of feathers require only further mutation .	1

actually , if you look at the example i have given , that ' s false . the probability of a in one organism may be low , but the probability of a in some organism approaches 100% as the population and the number of generations gets larger . and if a is useful and comes to dominate the population , then the probability of an ab individual appearing then also tends towards 100% . in the example above , the chance of an ab mutant occurring , if a and b are substantially useful mutations , is almost a dead certainty . it would be amazing if they did not stack . so saying that ab occurring is less likely than a is misleading at best , downright wrong at worst . behe is clearly misapplying probability theory .	0

this particular one , formulated the way it is , might well fail . that ' s why i hope the stupid attorney stops where he is . where do you get this bizarre idea that the court shies away from ' controversial ' issues ? o <elongated> . <repeated> that ' s a persuasive legal argument . i am impressed ( not ) . gay people have been ' earning it ' for over 100 years . in the short - term , we may suffer setbacks , in the long - term , there ' s no stopping us . another unsubstantiated pov that also happens to be untrue . no matter how many times the ditto - heads on the right say it , it remains a fact that the state supreme courts that have recognized the right of same - sex to marry have been dominated by moderate and conservative , republican - appointed judges . of course , they are part of the fading breed of conservatives . <repeated> the ones who believe in individual rights and freedom .	1
. <repeated> well . <repeated> in the last decade or so we have been starving them to death . where have you been ? the arguments are very similar if you consider a fetus to be a human being . i will grant you that . in the case of your c - section question , i think the mother should have the section , but we can never compell her to do so . it would be too dangerous a precedent to contemplate .	0

but it took a lot longer to develop . my point was that only after about 5000 years of human civilization did empiricism as science develop . religion , supernaturalism , and mythology trace back into prehistory . what we know as science did not even begin to exist until the late 1 5 0 0 s and 1 6 0 0 s . before that it was ok to do science like aristotle did - no experiment , only thinking about a logical answer . thus , heavy objects fell faster than light ones and any fool could tell that the sun orbited the earth . but science is more than an inner way of thinking . it is a process and a method for learning about the universe . it is called methodological naturalism . that is not to say the science asserts that nothing exists except what is natural . it says that science can not study the supernatural .	0

a more precise term would be " broaden , " since nothing about the definition pertaining to the people currently covered by it would be affected , " diluted " or altered in any way anyone has yet demonstrated . nothing about the definition that pertains to people who already are , or can be married changes one iota . their rights , benefits , and protections remain exactly the same . the only " change " would be to other people , people who have no connection to , nor impact on , the marriages of anyone else : the gays who will marry if the legal definition is broadened to encompass them . and the only " change " in that regard will be the fact that they are encompassed by it , nothing more . no substantive aspect of the definition as it currently stands changes in the slightest . the change is not in the definition itself . it ' s in who it applies to .	0

i have spoken favorably of religious believers who stand up for gay rights against a tyrannical version of christianity . what more do you want ? blood ? look , i disagree with the entire concept of religion . my view is that when religious believers support something that ' s right , they do it despite their religion , because it makes sense to them on the basis of humanitarian instincts , not religious ones . maybe sometimes their religion coincides with humanitarianism . all i can say to that is i wish it would do it more often than it does in practice !	0

again , please explain what possible benefits you forsee with teaching intelligent design . please show me where it is anything than a belief . evolution was always considered science . it used the scientific method , and offered evidence for everyone to see and peer review . until the " theory " of intelligent design does that , i will always be forced to put quotes around the word theory , because it will simply be a religious belief .	0
okay , at least you gave an example for reagan . i personally think the russians were on the decline long before the end of the cold war , and reagan happened to be president when they finally fell , but we can agree to disagree . for bush i hope you are joking , because it has been quite clear that his policies have more than likely created more terrorists than he has helped defeat ( not to mention the numerous other bad things he ' s done as president ) . in fact the only really good thing that came out of bush ' s presidency was that his unpopularity paved the way for obama to become president .	0

the fact that some scientists totally dismiss god is proof of there ignorance of scientific method . there is growing evidence to support the existence of a supreme being , and a lot of scientists are ignorant of this fact , yet they accept theories from the quantum level wich are not proven beyond the proof of the existence of god . mayabe your mind isnt as closed as others i have spoke with on this subject . i do believe in scientific method , but i also have faith that god is out there .	0
actually that was obvious based on your type of irrational reasoning .	1
that was a similar argument used for every single scientific discovery since the beginning of time . were is the biblical proof that god does not want cloning ? those that said the earth was round instead of flat were labled heretics . many people believed flying should be left to the birds that god created . in fact , some faith ' s still believe that science is wrong , medicine is a sin . it is a good thing that we do not let religion dictate our science , or we ' d still be thumping eachother with clubs and eating raw meat . pride caused the fall of the son of morning , not scientific discovery .	0
oh hank , you really are funny . the way you are changing . i simply made a statement that it was one of many posts that you have agreed on . that was the post you disputed . are you still near all those paint - fumes ? it must be the rotational affect of the egg - shaped world you live on ! <happy> as i said . <repeated> how simple is that ? it is one that you have agreed on , and you now agree that it ' s one of several that you have agreed on . what is your point ? i made a statement that you now agree on . you raised an objection , you even say that everyone knows what you said , excepting me . how have i demonstrated i do not understand you ? i have not disputed your original statement . i made a complimentary statement .	1
though i know you directed this question at cthulhu , i will nonetheless jump in to say that i would quickly choose the newborn mentally retarded baby to live and the zygote to die . that is obvious to me since the mentally retarded baby is a currently existing person vs . the zygote being merely a potential person . that zygote may have more potential for the future but the decision is being made in the present . i would feel far more guilt in sentencing a real person to die than in sentencing a potential person ( now merely a cell ) to die .	0

morals are what you make them to be . for example , ' it ' s ok to kill youths if they have insulted your prophets ' is another possible one . the ones in my joshua example ? he does not tell them , nor did i say that he told them . look at what i said : ' the morality of the old testament peoples ( god included ) is definitely questionable .

of course not . that battle has already been lost . creationism is religion and it cannot be taught in a science class , even when it is called " creation science " and the data is distorted and mininterpreted . the most recent attempt by creationists in kansas on the state board ( and yes , they were yecs ) was to eliminate all requirements to teach evolution , and all references to an old earth from all curriculum standards .	0

so you argue that for some women , abortion is the ' easy way out ' , and that those women choose to abort , take the easy way out as you say , for arbitrary reasons ? could you please reiterate these reasons here ( preferably in an enumerated list ) and explain why they should be considered arbitrary ? indeed . but we have established that supposing a higher profile in the media in no way entails an actual increase in incidents . so i will repeat the question , hearsay aside , upon what evidence do you base the assertion that more women are abandoning infants ?	0

i do not that it ' s selfish so much as self - interested . there is a difference . most people want to live a long life . is this selfish ? the idea of an after life is merely an extension of this same idea . why do you think belief in an afterlife leads to contempt for society ?	0
having been raised in texas as a child and teen , with many relatives still residing there , i am surprised their educational system has not gone to the bible as its primary textbook . perhaps things have changed , but fundamentalist hypocrisy was at one time the law of the land in texas . maybe since texans are no longer served by oklahoma and louisiana bootleggers the fire and brimstone circuit has relaxed , but i ' d find that difficult to believe as religion is a very effective control technique .	0
i know you are talking to jessica , so i will only comment on this . it would be easier to make it rare if pro - life people were not intent on making it illegal . pro - choice people have to make it as available as possible to counter pro - life attempts to shut it down entirely . if pro - life people did not exist , then the reasonable people could work towards making abortion rare . take the current debates for example . my entire point is that it should not be illegal . that abortion should be available as a safe and legal choice ( it can only be really safe if it ' s legal ) . we spend all our time and effort debating the legality that we spend no time on creating programs to help women choose to continue their pregnancies instead of having an abortion , legal or not .	0

how is that conclusion derived at ? the passage is speaking to the consequences to a man who ' s actions cause the death of an unborn child . and the proscribed consequence is death according to ot law . so although the passage is not speaking to abortion at all , it is making a very clear statement regarding the value of the unborn , as it is requiring a life for a life just as for any other sentient being according to the ot law . so these arguments i get from the likes of you and iangb which argue that until a child shows mental awareness , it is not actually a person deserving of human rights is a bogus and shortsighted position according to the scriptural point of view . of that , there is no question .	0

that is an erroneous line of reasoning because it fails to take into account the myriad of other options open to a women after birth to remove the newborn from her care without any ill effects ( physically anyway ) . killing in the instance of a newborn is not justified because of those other options open to her . by contrast , a pregnant woman has exactly one option open to her to remove the fetus from her care and that is abortion . i would contend that the same line of reasoning that allows for adoption can be used here , that no one must donate their resources to a dependant . your reasoning that a woman , using the same line of reasoning that pro - choice people employ , can withhold her bodily resources " until the newborn dies " as if that is equal to withholding bodily resources in pregnancy is faulty .	0

( my evidence does not require this quote , it ' s for comparison only ) the theory of evolution is based on evidence , the existence of god , is not . <repeated> reason cannot be applied to it . furthermore , since evolution relies on reason , faith cannot be applied to it . to attempt to label science as a faith is a contradiction . i know it irks you that your faith cannot be proven , but that ' s the definition of faith ! <repeated> it would not be faith without it . as montalban says in a contradiction of motives : his particular faith does not rest on the foundations of [ reason ] . why then look for support from reason ?	0

it did not because it was not clear till the 1 9 7 0 s that horizontal gene transfer was something to be considered . nobody knew the mechanism till that era . and of course hgt is just another form of variability to be taken into account . genes transfered horizontally are as subject to selection as anyother form of gene . once intergrated into the recieving genome they are simply one more heritable element and if they alter the phenotypes ( many are either neutral or even inactivatee ) then of course they are subject to selection . why do you think otherwise ? remember that horizontal transfer is a rare event roughly on a par with ordinary mutations .	0

only those ignorant of science and evolution think that " evolution " has anything to do with the bible . i guess that ' s because creationism is an attempt to pretend that mythology is somehow scientific and makes silly statements about science . it seems that science is somehow anti - bible in that case when science debunks ignorance .	1
just helping something live does not affect evolution unless it affects the ability to reproduce viable offspring . if there was no nylon before the 1 9 4 0 s and there is an organism that can survive by eating <allcaps> nothing </allcaps> else , what does that tell you ? there could not have been a population of nylon - eating bacteria before 1940 . this is a new population that did not exist before .	1

simone is quite right . <repeated> women will no longer breed to order according to the dictats of outdated religion . british muslim women will follow at some point ( many already are ) . there are a few hothead extremists who sit on london street corners with placards stating that " uk will be islamic " , " sharia law for uk " etc . etc . but those nutters are ignored along with all the other ( non - religious ) nutters currently walking the streets of london . ( for the record , muslims make up 2.1 per cent of the total united kingdom population . they are hardly " taking over " ) . " muslims are taking over the world " is a poor excuse of a reason to be anti - abortion and shows desperation , <allcaps> imo </allcaps> !	0

so you are saying that this country is based on principles of judaism ? that is a date , dummy . it is not a founding principle . it was how dates were done . and ' our lord ' could have been mohamed for all you know , except that it was the standard for dates . no christian principles . so at least you admit that you can not give a single location and that you can not even tell me how many times god , jesus , and religion are mentioned .	1

archie , the only way you can possibly come to that conclusion is by literally ignoring everything the author says , every accepted definition of the words socialism , statism , capitalism , fascism and nazism . if we ignore everything the author says and make up our own definitions for those words , it <allcaps> still </allcaps> does not work because the argument is <allcaps> still </allcaps> illogical and you look like a dishonest fool making it . face it . you got pwned . are you really not bright enough to recognize that ?	1

hello there , my dear fellow , you are using a 1 9 th century definition for a 2 1 st century subject . it does not work . what you are writing is pure drivel . there is the caucasian group which you initially mention , then you misuse the terminology , actually meaning the sub - ethnicities of the caucasians . no doubt you are one of those sadly misinformed individuals who believes that ' muslim ' is a race . the state of education is surely at an all time low - and getting lower no doubt . cheers from the rockies emoticonxkill emoticonxhoho emoticonxcry emoticonxkill	0

now lets add one more wrench into the anti - gun works ! when the american people read , 90% of weapons come from the u . s . they are led to think , bought in an american gun store . something even sinjin apparently believes as well . however , doing some research , i found this april 19, 2005 report that tells how u . s . weapons can end up in mexico and be things that the citizen cannot buy in a gun store . why ? because they came from the u . s . government , dea and the cia . military grade weapons . now how many can be traced back to legally purchased u . s . weapons ? central america : the farc , the contras and the flow of weapons america ! get the picture now ?	0

very true . logic exists whether people are there to grasps its concepts or not . where we disagree is at your assumption that god created logic . how can this be ? logic is not contingent on any intelligent entity , whether it be man or god , to exist . the logic of increasing a quantity by adding to it would remain whether god existed or not . you have yet to tie the existence of logic to god as its cause	0

well , i own a new testament ( only the new ) book myself . so i am really surprised that you have not seen one before . <repeated> but whatever . what i am saying , and what random dude seem to not get , is that christianity is based on the new testament . we believe in both books . <repeated> but when people ask , what is a christian ? a christian is a person who believes in jesus - jesus only exist in the new testament - therefore if the new testament did not exist , then christianity would not exist either . so that is why christianity is based ( remember the word based ) on the gospels .	0
i guess this disease is ' contagious ' thus due to this contagious disease it can spread rapidly . if he dies then no one gets infected and vice versa . although , i believe that if that is the situation i do not the infected persons opinion matters . if you possibly may kill even 1 person you will probably be isolated from social world and be taken to a place where you have no contact with the public no questions asked .	0

dear chloe , do you really want women tried for murder because they decide to take a pill that will cause an abortion ? that is the only logical position a court can take once a zygote , embryo and fetus are legislated into the status of human beings . if one kills a human being , one is guilty of murder .	0

there is much evidence of long - term relationships for gay couples ( that do last more than five years ) . <repeated> <url> <url> <url> <url> being gay is not an illness , so it cannot be cured . that is not true , as joe pointed out , and has been pointed out over and over again in this forum . sounds like a closet case trying to convince himself to be straight , or a guy who expects every woman to want him . therefore what we are talking about , does not exist ? give me a break .	1
i agree . hence why we need to evict the gop from the congress today it is evident by the liberal history of the gop majority that they cannot be trusted with money , with the size of government , with foreign relations , with underage pages , with the military in general , with privacy , civil rights or even the most basic function of congress : oversight . liberalism needs to be evicted from congress , therefore the republicans need to go . it never stopped bothering me that more democrats voted aganist the schavio bill then republicans . democrats more conservative then republicans ? well . <repeated> given how far republicans have gone over i can not say i am surprised .	0

actually , it is a mutation . just like the color of the fur is a mutation . polar bear fur is not white , it is colorless . moreover , it is hollow . that is another mutation . and polar bears have longer legs than their closest relatives , the brown bears . they have smaller ears . none of the changes are caused by " friction " . by the way , the webs between the toes of a polar bear are very much like the webs between the toes of a duck . adaptation is , by the way , evolution . i presume that is the word you meant to use . adaptation is not adaption . you talk about the process as if it were adaption and then call it adaptation . in reality it is adaptation .	0
what i have been saying here , and after awhile - the guilt , depression , etc - will get buried , deeper & deeper - but no negative / damaging experiences leave people . they stay quietly in the background - computer base - until , as you said : hopefully , the person " finds some way of forgiving themselves " , right . but what about in the mean - time ? - and we know , from research & quite a number of healers , that rot ( inside a person ) is damaging . <repeated> and often in very unsuspecting ways . much better to life benevolently , in the first place . annie	0
i believe a man should be able to opt out of fatherhood . the problem with this article for me is the moral ambiguity - there is no consistent argument laid out for free choice , that is choice for women and men , or even one for consistent slavery ( forced births from women , forced money from men ) . it reeks of the vindictiveness that can be seen in any number of fringe movements , of the " i do not really care whether we live in a just society , as long as you are not treated better than me " . so yes , i " a real pro - choicer " agree with matt here , the pro - choicers who are portrayed as disagreeing appear to be some kind of stereotyped 1 9 7 0 s feminist - socialist - activist - bra - burning type .	0

ephesians does indeed talk of salvation through faith created in christ jesus unto good works ( 2:10 ) . i must admit that im not totally sure what this means , that faith leads to good works ? id dispute that . whilst most of romans does talk of salvation through faith , romans 2 : 6 says however god will render to every man according to his deeds . in the end , the point is moot . i dont really care if the bible does say that man is justified by faith alone ( and it doesnt conclusively ) , my point is that i am unwilling to worship a creature that justifies only by faith anyway .	0

i know what you meant . my comment was to demonstrate the counter side of the issue . interracial marriage laws were overturned at a time when this country disapproved of interracial marriage by a margin of three to one . by your approach , interracial marriage laws <allcaps> should not </allcaps> have been overturned in the 1960 ' s . in fact , by your approach we still would have had illegal interracial marriage into the late 80 ' s , early 90 ' s . the 1 4 th amendment makes no proviso about allowing unjust discrimination in cases of majority rule . by your approach , <allcaps> what would be the point </allcaps> ? if the majority disapproves of the discrimination , they simply " vote " it out of existence . no need for the courts at all .	0

pandion has already pointed out that this is not a theory , it ' s a mode of wishful thinking . more damagingly , however , if you examine it for more than a moment it does not even fulfill the role you give it . you say ' many things in nature make no sense without god ' , but how do god ' s origins and nature make sense ? where did he / she / it spring from ? all you do by invoking god as an ' explanation ' is push the problems one step further back . the god hypothesis may look like an explanation , but it is not .	0

shall we regress to babble ? the government is already heavily into the term ' marriage ' . not only the us government , but governments all over the world refer to ' marriage ' as the legal union of a man and a woman . changing the definition in one country would likely create confusion everywhere . what if some countries required you to clarify whether you were married to a man or a woman in order to get a visa ? do we need to define several types or classes of ' married couple ' . what if some countries objecting to the concealment of the gender of one ' s spouse instituted a death penalty for it ? i would argue that legally joined same - sex couples should have all the benefits and rights afforded married couples , but not for redefining ' marriage ' solely for the purpose of calling them such .	1

your claim is not supported in the least . if we look to the landmark abortion case roe v . wade , we find that it was not women seeking abortions that were punished , but the people who procured the abortion that were . it would be the same if abortion were again made illegal . to prove this , we need only to look at a recent abortion regulatory statute : the partial birth abortion ban act . needless to say , there are far less doctors who perform abortions than there are women who seek them , and because it was not a problem executing abortion law prior to 1973 , it likewise will not be a problem executing abortion law should abortion be made illegal again .	0

actually , the fossil record does support it . both eldredge and gould have discussed it . both men made observations of slow gradual speciation in the fossil record in a small geographical area . these changes were reflected at other locations as an abrupt change from one species to another . but given that such changes take place very quickly in populations that are usually under environmental stress and isolated from the main population , and given the rarity of fossilization in the first place , we do not expect to find many examples in the fossil record . it is a bit like trying to time a 100 yd . dash with a sundial . the fossil record just is not fine grained enough to see the rapid ( 50 - 60 thousand years ) changes .	0

the reason why premise 1 can logically stand is that god is first of all defined as the " greatest possible being " . no matter what reality we are considering , such a thing as the greatest possible being in that relity must exist .

well memory is <allcaps> not </allcaps> something that is immaterial is it . its always implemented in the form of material processes well known to biochemistry . metabolism , ion flows , neuron activity and interconnections , along with potentiation of those connections into networks . free - will of course is what we call the experience of our choices being not wholly determined by external states alone . by no means does that exclude the fact that our internal states ( of which we are largely ignorant ) also play a role . the autonomy arises from the operation of the brain and those internal states . again a purely materialist explanation . and there is no evidence of anything other than material processes in the experience of free - will . in other words neither memory nor free - will require a non - materialist viewpoint .	0

so the " origin of species " has more information for theistic evolutionists than the bible does ? <repeated> does theistic evolution believe in satan ?	1
winston dearie you really should not make such general accusations , that can get you into trouble . point them out if you can . the shooting in norway , columbine , virginia tech , the tulsa shootings and the tuscon assassination attempt were not carried out by people a normal person could consider decent and respectable in nature and they were all massacres . you might kill somebody too . you might kill a lot of somebodies for no reason . should you be legislated against and restrained ?	0

well , the slavery analogy for gay rights is past it ' s applicability at this point - - one was a property issue ( also rooted in deep prejudice ) , the other is a morality issue . many people oppose gay marriage out of morality and <allcaps> not </allcaps> prejudice . the same can not be said for slavery . there are many ways that the analogy does not work and that ' s just one of them . in fact , it could as easily be an analogy to reverse it and say that the ones who did the enslaving were analogous to gay rights lobbyists and the abolitionists were analogous to those who seek to protect marriage . after all , the plantation owners were the ones really fighting for ill - conceived rights - - rights that they should not have had .	0
so what ? i do not care ! gun ownership is an individual right and that ' s the end of it ! you do not have to exercise a right hundreds of thousands of times a year for it to be protected by the constitution .	0
' blah blah blah ' ? look , you weighed in here on what i said , making an issue of whether it was internal , empatically making a point that it was action . as i said , i am basically agreeing with you on the whole thing here about there needing to be equality in this situation , so i do not know why you are being so eager to find something to disagree over here .	1

so you think it is a good idea for public schools to assume the role of parents ? perhaps you would support a balance then . given what you say here , you would not think it a bad idea for the new hampshire school system to take a field trip to the local catholic church would you ? you know , so kids can know what resources , agencies , and organizations are available to them in the event that they may need to interact with them in the future . the school board apparently gets the message , however . according to the article , it has instructed school administrators to investigate the matter , and determine whether disciplinary action is necessary . i would think it is .	1
well as long as you ignore the evidence , why do you need proof . blind faith works just fine .	1
so have you found figures pertaining to the rate of mountain growth ? it is not enough to see with the naked eye the way erosion is . this explanation would also cause some mountains to fall as tectonic plates move away from eachother . again after billions of years all rivers in existence would be deeper than those in the grand canyon without the material coming down from mountains .	0

nearly all the food humans eat today , even in the western world is gm including maize , tomatoes , and soy , etc , etc . used as ingredients in products such some soymilk . essentially everything is with the exception of " organic " . however , as i noted above , i would not make this argument because i think gm soy esecially is not very healthy for people snd gm foods tend to be more prone to bacterial infection which can make people sick . i have not read from all sides , however .	0
who said pregnancy is the only bad thing ? we already talked about ceverical cancer . furthermore , condoms do not always work . <repeated> bad protection . maybe not , but wearing a bright red sign that says ' stalk me ' sure will get the ones that are out there . your limited world shield you from the realities of life . <repeated> which is really a bad thing i suppose but it gives a better reason to listen to your parents . are not you a warm - hearted person you are in cancun talking to people on a pointless forum . <repeated> does anyone else think this is rather odd ?	0
and she was having unprotected sex ? so she knew becoming pregnant was a possibility ? yeah , i could see that being condemned by pro - lifers .	0
it will not . i ' d think any responsible parent with a teen under the age of 18 who has a sound relationship with that teen would discuss the possibility of her becoming sexually active ( a normal function in spite of some puritan attitudes ) and offer simple avoidance of possible pregnancy and abortion . like vehicle insurance she may never need it , but going without either one is plain stupid .	0

actually , everything the bible say ' s belies your " atheist answer " . the reality is that the world itself and all of gods creation speaks to his existence as being self evident . it takes a degree of faith to accept jesus as our personal savior , but as far as accepting the reality of god himself , all one need do is look observe the world we live in to see that only an incredible and loving god could create such a beautiful and marvelous world with so many amazing symbiotic and perfectly interdependent forms of life .	0
of course everyone has some basis for their views . not even denying that . however there are ways that using that " basis " most certainly is an imposition and the gay rights battle is a prime example . there are many , many , many people who have done work to stop / block gay marriage and other gay rights when they , themselves , are not gay . that is not merely passing judgement - that is imposition . all i am asking here is that archie , you , jp , etc . own that .	0

which is pretty much normal for arch . do you think he realizes that many muslims in europe are cultural muslims ? that many who emigrate to europe are quite disgusted with what they see back in their homelands ? the rise of gay muslims in europe is quite interesting as to how they have fully adopted the views of their adopted european homeland and are afraid of returning to their original home countries . the notion that arch has that once a muslim always a crazy muslim is pretty nuts , but nothing but typical from a guy who thought that tv props are good evidence for 6,000 year old acts of creation .	0

that is a specious argument . the constitution is not an embodiment of what is good and evil for humans to do , but of what is of value in a free society . the constitution does not judge the goodness and badness of human character . ideas for laws come from morality ? the concept of morality came from a desire to survive as we evolved . so you see the law preventing someone from interfering with your life as the same as the law allowing someone to interfere with your life ?	0
ms . bennet , in your opinion , is the anglican church apostolic ? if so , what is the case that it presents for apostolic succession ? the roman church did not start as an imperial church . the empire wasn ' t around for 300 years or so . i think many martyrs of the faith would differ with that assertion . it started at peter ' s appointment as the foundation of the church and was solidified in the upper room after jesus ' resurrection . why do you desire to receive communion at a catholic church ?	0
so what are some examples of restrictive gun laws in south africa ? the people in south africa think their gun laws are not strict enough . in one of your previous posts you seem determined to use south africa as evidence that outlawing guns does not work .	0

i think you might want to check your logic here . <repeated> as far as i am aware , drug addicts cause a great deal of crime to support their habit . as you are , i am not terribly fond of policing someone ' s personal habits , but when drugs are the motivating force behind burglaries , assaults and muggings and addicts carry diseases such <allcaps> aids </allcaps> and tuberculosis then means of curtailing this should be explored . this may include policing or controlling the supply of drugs to an area to cut down and the amount of drugs sold , and thus less crime to support fewer habits . easy access to drugs is , logically , part of the problem .	0
at what cost ? how many civil rights are you willing to give up in the name of a few less murders each year ? are you perfectly willing to be stopped by the police on a block - by - block basis and forced to show identification and traveling papers , all the while the officers on location are pointing their guns right at your head , ready to <allcaps> x <elongated> </allcaps> you away at the first sign of a twitch or if you display even a hint of hesitation to comply ? how desperately do you crave a police state ? how much do you favor a nationwide curfew where violators can be arrested by the police and held without legal counsel for an indefinite period of time ? do you favor the use of physical and mental torture to force convictions even from the innocent ?	0
d . adams ? <happy> this is , of course , an entire debate unto itself . i fully concede that logic dictates that we accept the possibility of life elsewhere . but that it ' s probable ? we simply do not have the data to make that leap . we have got some good theories about how life started here , but we do not know exactly what happened . and even if we did , we do not know how common those conditions are ' out there ' . if the conditions for life to arise are so bizarre that they only occur once every 20 billion years , and for all we know they might be , than we may well be the only life in the universe . logically , we just can not say . we do not have enough info to apply logic to the problem .	0

falling , did i say that ' the church alone provides for the needy ?

i feel the opposite is true . i feel a lack of hierarchy adds complication to the layout . it ' s pretty functional do not get me wrong . freaking cool site , but i mean you have all this opportunity to explore hierarchy and color ( brand = two colors , blue / orange , arguments has 2 choices . <repeated> ) . they even dabbled in it a little with the ' add argument ' buttons above . the grid structure of the layout seems mildly confusing as well . for instance , the vertical alignments of usernames with their respective arguments could match up more uniquely to aid in clarity . or if the leading ( space between lines of text ) wasn ' t so consistent , each ' argument ' might be better framed visually , without the addition of graphics or color . obviously , this is not gospel or some fantastic soultion , i just think lack of color could be one of a few ideas on improving clarity and functionality of the site .	0

so sorry , anastasia . <repeated> that ' s a horrible thing to face . and now , using that excuse ? what ! if justice was swift for the guilty then he would not have escaped only to do it again . some criminals never change , and via your testimony , only live to do it again . there are some who need to be put to death . your situation made me shudder , anastasia . but , i am glad you did not let it ( revenge ) effect you to the point of taking his life yourself . if it would have been my father , those many years ago , i cannot say that i would have waited , nor would have accepted that lame excuse of retardation . i could very well be in prison myself .	0

why do so many lifers just skip right past the pregnancy as if it has no impact ? i am not talking about parenting . i do not advocate forcing anyone to parent . ever . that is why i support safe haven laws , signing away of parental rights , etc . i am talking about pregnancy . only a woman can be pregnant and should have the ultimate say in whether or not she is . it is her body , not your ' s , not the state ' s , not the church ' s , and not the fetus ' . when it comes to pregnancy - you wish only to legislate the bodies / reproductive organs of women . i bet you would not advocate chemical castration for any male who is not yet ready to be a parent .	0
so your claim that no pre - existing belief is necessary is untested by you . do you have an example of an actual non - believer having a religious experience that made a believer of them ? in my experience god never appears to atheists . funny that .	1

i have got a better compromise . we will keep our magazines in whatever size we please , and we will ban you , j miro , simone , and a random forum troll to be named later . that sounds fair and even in terms of trade to me .	1
but the belief that ' its gotten us far ' is itself a ' scientific ' type belief , in fact it has less proof on the empirical assumptions than the science itself . justifying the validity of experience by experience is the intellectual equivalent of saying ' god must exist , because god is good and would not allow a world without god ' .	0
it ' s truly amazing that even someone like kh can disprove evolution so quickly .	0

well regulated as in the second amendment does not mean regulated by the government , it means well equiped and prepared . the framers of the constitution often spoke of a tyrannical government and how to keep one from coming to power , so why in the hell would they have said lets just give the government total control of guns . your definition of well regulated makes about as much sense as adding another day to the week .	0

and i am a clump of human cell with shoes on . <repeated> what is your point ? no . you seem to refuse the idea that ' human ' as a noun is used to describe a human being meaning the entity as a whole and not the individual cells that make it up . i am sorry you do not understand this but the word means what it means . i find it odd that you even care what you call a fetus anyway . your sperm is a human now ? you should invest in a biology book .	1
let us establish a campaign to search for the hypocrisy of people who call themselves pro - life yet find nothing wrong with killing a grown human being .	1
well can you point to an instance , either in canada or the united kingdom , where the government mandated firearm registries have been instrumental in solving any number of vicious and felonious crimes ? i am not talking about catching people who let their registration lapse , or those who told their spouses about the location of their gun locker keys , i am talking about serious crimes like murder and robbery and others . can you provide us with any evidence that would point to how the registries have helped solve any such happenings ?	0

you know that what you call " immoralism " is my life . why do you hate me so much that you would be willing to deny my the happiness that you take forgranted and as your due ? you do not even know me yet you are willing to defame me just because i am different from you . i do not understand how i am running over you by living my life openly and wanting the same thing as you the right to consider whom i choose to be my family . if you have an opinion about gay rights thats fine . if you want to deny me the same rights , as you take for granted , because of your opinion and beliefs though laws then that is bigotry .	0

addition works in the intangible as well . 1 minute + 1 minute = 2 minutes . 1 idea + 1 idea = 2 ideas . the concept of quantity is not limited to matter . if there was just a vaccous void were absolutely nothing was happening , then there would be no application of logic . but even that in itself would be logical . nothing + nothing = nothing is logical . it would actually be logical if a void with nothing added to it result in something . so even in a void , logic still prevails	0

pro - choice is a sexist concept . it only applies to women . pro - choice does not give you much of a choice . it sounds like what you are saying is that anything that has to do with only one gender , is sexist . if not , please clarify . pro choice does give you a choice . you can either continue the pregnancy , or seek an abortion . the pro life argument eliminates abortion and mandates that you continue the pregnancy ( barring rape , etc ) . if you are joking , then ignore this .	0

this statement is wrong . people from hundreds of years before jesus was born prophesied that a baby would be born , in bethlehem , of a virgin . there were over 50 more prophesies that were made about his life , and the sacrafice he made to pay for the sins of man , and the bigest one of all . <repeated> he completely fufilled scripture when he rose from the dead . these men were inspired by jesus , god , how can you argue that he is not the christ ? the odds of one man filling all the prophesies is impossible . and these scriptures have been unchanged for the past 2000 - 2500 approx years ! thats proof for me that jesus existed and that he is god . pm me if you like .	0

no , there really are not . as for robertson , why do you think i said he was right ( as in global warming is happening and we are largely responsible ) by sheer luck ?	0
another question that shouild be answered is . . . if the bible says that noah and a few members of his family were the only ones to survive this ' global ' flood , how come there are so many other accounts of others surviving a flood ? did god miss the target ( that being the whole of humanity ) ? genesis 6:13 ( new international version ) 13 so god said to noah , ' i am going to put an end to all people , for the earth is filled with violence because of them . i am surely going to destroy both them and the earth . presumably he also knew from the beginning of time that he was going to make this great big # # # # - up . how embarrassing !	1
whether a fetus is a person is not something open to consideration . an apple is not an orange . the reason that we have two words to apply as labels is simply because they absolutely are not the same thing . it is that simple . suppose that a fetus is frozen and implanted in a female 22 years later . is it of legal drinking age at birth ? obviously not . we currently have the technology to actually do this .	0

i suppose piltdown man was the product of newspapers , cute indeed !	1
why do you assume the poster did not use birth control ? they said nothing about birth control ; only a statement on being pregnant and having an abortion . also , why do you make any assumptions about suffering ? according to the poster , suffering was avoided . condoms are not 100% effective . a childhood friend ' s younger sibling was the product of a failed condom , among other factors . nine months and nine weeks are completely different .	0

you know , i am astonished at the fact that during an osce conference on combating discrimination and promoting mutual respect and understanding that took place in bucharest early in june , the attendees discussed all sort of things except the flagrant current situation in poland this country gains the lead among european countries in violation of human rights in terms of anti - semitism , racism , hatred to moslems , xenophobia , homophobia , and discrimination against hiv - positive persons . this fact was evinced in poland ' s country report on human rights practices - 2006 released by us department bureau of democracy , human rights , and labor . here i present you part of the report that has relevance to the subject . to put it short , there are quite a lot of people in poland who suffer persecution jews , non - europeans ( arabs , moslems , africans , roma ) , persons of alternative sexuality and hiv - positive persons .	0

there are precious few areas on the planet that have not been explored . those that have not would not support the kinds of life we are talking about . there is no evidence of any interim species of apes and humans . not one shred . those items in the fossil record that are claimed as possibles are only possibles , are dubious at best , and are extremely rare . a recent study also showed that most characteristics of supposed alternate species of hominids were well within the variation seen in current homo sapiens . the point i was making is that if they existed we would see them .	0

quite frankly , you do not know squat about me . so stop trying to pretend you do . i have gone on record to say i think christianity does a lot of good in the world . i have even tried to correct matthew in his anti - christian tirades .

but that is how creationism works - half truth . evolution is a theory but do not make it quite clear that in science the word theory does not mean half - assed guess , as it does in creationism . check out that little piece of * * * * that was added to the bottom of the patterns of cumulative change paragraph on page 7 . that is pure <allcaps> yec </allcaps> . and you are not a <allcaps> yec </allcaps> ?	1
the <allcaps> vast </allcaps> majority of abortions are performed within the first trimester . when they are performed in the second trimester it ' s a serious procedure for the mother to go through , and is something she obviously would not go into lightly . her reasons for choosing an abortion as late as that would have to far outweigh anything else , and she would need consent from two doctors to go ahead with it . basically what i am trying to say is something like the foetus being developed enough to feel pain would not change the mind of a woman who had just found out she was pregnant and she ' d been raped , or was going through something you can not understand . for an abortion that late she ' d have to deliver the foetus anyway , which is traumatising enough .	0
and think of what other animals have built ( and for an actual purpose ) . take a look at a bee hive . it ' s so complex and so perfect for them . they built that . an ant hill is at least 20 times the size of an ant . that ' s 120 feet for us ( for a 6 foot person ) .	0
one should not assume ignorance on the part of creationists . that is a mistake that too many evolutionists make . in the real world , we have people willing to say things they already know is not true . why should creationists be any different ? after all , they are people , too . but rather than accept that fact , evolutionists argue that creationists are ignorant of a subject when , in reality , they ( creationists ) were simply telling lies .	0
so what is your point ? are you claiming that the tenets of christianity are in doubt because the several thousand denominations hold contradictory views ? science proceeds by challenges and contradictions . contradiction in science is not evidence of doubt but evidence of a field of advance . in religion , it is without question , a matter of the veracity of the ultimate truth . which of the thousands of christian faiths hold the truth ?	0
but on the other hand , genesis is not a scientific document . no wonder . why would a bronze age nomad from the levant be aware of at least 3 tailless species of primates , or even the tailed primates from africa , south america , and even madigascar . if they are not mentioned in the bible , do they exist ?	1

i am so sorry to hear about what has happened to you . i hope you get away from this terrible man and surround yourself with people who love you . i must ask , though , why are you a christian ? you completely disagree with typical christian sentiments on abortion , you feel none of the purported guilt the religious movement implies is inevitable , you feel like you did the right thing , so why would you continue to profess to belong to this religion if you disagree with one of the major issues of the day ?	0

yea i agree with you on how there was no exact se t of laws at the beginning of creation . the reason i say that they most likely did not marry their sisters is mostly cause god gets mad at cain and places a mark on his head so everyone he runs across will not kill him unless they want to die a death 10 times worse than his . kinda just says that there are other people out there .	0

i am not really surprised at the bush administrations lack of a forest management plan . he known for not being an enviromentally - friendly president . forest fires are usually a natural occurance . they are often good for the eco - systems . it ' s the man made disasters that are the problem . we can not stop forest fires , but we can keep the property damage to a minimum by thining forests , building access roads where posible to fight the fires , and have stricter control over timber harvests . often the timber companies over - cut certain areas , leaving the lanscape a barren , lifeless terrain , not suited for wildlife habitat . soil erosion can become a problem also , as the silt from the soil erosion pollutes the streams and damages the fish habitat . the government needs a good forest management plan for public lands , and more funding for personel to impliment the current programs of forest management .	0
is your thinking really this simplistic ? either i have to agree with you or i am an anarchist ? is that all the complexity you can handle ? this or that ? black or white ? the best soda in the world is sprite and everything else is wrong ? what a boring little pigeon - holed world you live in . no harm no foul - that is where i stand on sex and romance . kids , animals and those who do not or can not consent are off - limits . k ? now that i have established ( <allcaps> again </allcaps> ) how i feel on that matter , let me reinstate . any god that allows love and intimacy for only a select group is viscious .	1

well , as usual the creationist is trying to make an arguement against science using their moral viewpoint . forget about all that pseudo science trying to discredit evolution and geochronology , all it comes down to is this : " my religion has the exact answers to questions about my origins , i do not like what science has to say on this subject " . its so much more succinct that way , i just wish they could be up front about it .	0
the nice part . i am surprised that you have even read the bible . presumably you are commenting on 1 thessalonians 5 : 2 , wherein paul admonishes the greeks to be watchful for the coming of god ? the funny thing is that all of my bibles say that .	1
that distinction may be irrelevant since they do say that no god that any religious person believes in exists . and that is what i was getting at originaly . still i think that the idea that the existence of all religious gods can be ultimately refuted based on the logic you bring up is invalid .	0
ah , so i do not like democracy , and yet it is you who in the post are telling me that i have to support mccain ' s statement . are you serious ? that sure does not sound like democracy to me . i also find it funny that you claim that i do not like democracy when my very post stated that i would be voting for the democrat party . but then , i guess if we do not support bushyboy and his fellow republicanazis , we must be against democracy , right ? get real , phyllis .	1

it depends on what kind of faith you are talking about . do you mean ' having faith ' in actual things ? if so , then most definately . although the world can sometimes be a cruel and horrible place , it can also be a fantastic one , and seeing that ( as i am an athiest ) gives me some kind of ' faith ' in the human capacity , society , etc ( where as a religious person may well have the same reaction for their faith in god ) .	0
and i did not have to choose to be homosexual . it is a natural inclination . i chose not to hide or lie about who i am . however you are the one who seems to be under the delusion that being gay is a choice . once again i ask you if it is just a choice then you choose to be gay this moment .	1

i am surprised at the density of posters still attempting to tie zarqawi to saddam ' s government or ( prior to us occupation resistance ) al qaeda . his actions in iraq prior to the us invasion were limited to kurdish territory , where saddam was attempting to contain that rebellion , and zarqawi was never a disciple of bin laden . zarqawi ' s bio has been reviewed on the internet many , many times : <url> as to al qaeda training camps in saudi arabia , they do exist in spite of publicized saud government attempts to eliminate them . even the most naive poster with even a minute understanding of the saud steel grip on their nation should be able to comprehend that if the sauds did not want something , it would not be there . and need i mention pakistan ? <url> <url>	0

so was dominating and enslaving of women . does not mean we should do it just because it has historicity . actually i have heard this idea by numerous people , on both sides of the issue . i can see the merits myself - - give couples ' benefits in a way that does not utilize a cultural and religious institution that has nothing to do with legality to begin with . that way at least cultural marriage does not have to be redefined to any extent and legal benefits would no longer be any sort of reflection of any one group ' s cultural and ideological views . by the way , what do you mean by ' anti - gay ' in your phrase ' anti - gay people ' ? that ' s always important to nail down .	1

look around , the greatest majority of gun - related violence occurs were people are not allowed to be armed , or have to go through great leaps and bounds to qualify for being armed . this is because the criminals who get their guns illegally and plans to use them to harm others know that their chances of encountering an armed victim are next to nothing , putting them in an near - absolute position of authority where they can do whatever they want . and the point is what exactly in this statement ? last i checked thailand and israel were arming school teachers because too many students were either being held hostage or murdered . after the teachers became armed these rates dropped . why ? because schools were no longer soft targets and threats could be met with deadly force immediately within a second ' s notice .	1

for me , this is like the idea that the speed of light was once very fast and has now slowed down . both ideas indirectly call god a liar . this is bad . if all of our experiments show the earth is 4.5 billion years old , then that is how old it is . if the bible says something different , then either god meant genesis for peoples past and now uses scientists to explain things better ( though i am uncomfortable with this idea as many scientists are atheists ) , or our puny minds , compared with god ' s , have not yet worked out how genesis and an old earth tie together .	0
wow <elongated> . you learned how to say something other than ' you are going to hell ' . did your mother teach you that , or are you just copying what i am doing ? cuz i doubt you are smart enough to learn anything by yourself .	1

sorry your mightiness , thank you for your graciousness of addressing us common folk . are you really that obtuse ? i swear you and easy share a brain . i clearly pointed out that this commandment talks about respect for authority . personally , i think this applies to single parents , families with 2 daddies , or children raised in an orphanage . yet i bet somehow in the formative years of the children , they are taught some form of respect for authority . how so ? i did not write it , i am just commenting on it . and again , i prefer to replace ' mother and father ' with authority . regardless , who says respect = fear ? maybe you and easy really do share a brain . <repeated> you both seem to think you can define words as you see fit to lend creedence to your arguments .	1
well , it showed how it was physically possible to generate amino acids from inorganic material . that ' s rather impressive . again , irrelevant and unrelated to the scientific theory of evolution , regardless of you trying to create that association . your continued attempt at doing so despite having been shown and told multiple times that the two are unrelated , well that only shows one thing , namely that you are dishonest .	0

i believe that ' s true , and as a " believer " ( creationist ) , here is what is hard to understand about that ; in matthew , 12:30 , jesus says " he who is not with me is against me , and he who does not gather with me scatters " . it is safe to say that both creationists and theistic evolutionists would accept that statement from jesus , and would seek to be " with " him , while agnostic and atheists would consider themselves " not with " him . yet theistic evolutionists are comfortable to ( usually politically ) be " with " agnostics and atheists , and separate themselves from creationists . if they are genuine christians , knowing about the warnings in the bible about false teachings , how can they be comfortable with that ? miller laments in several places throughout the book that atheists use evolution as a weapon against religion , and that it should not be that way - that it causes more strife between the two than should exist .	0
wow , what a group of rude , self important , pompous , pseudo intellectuals who will insult and personally attack a person for one grammatical error . i meant to say the <allcaps> universe </allcaps> has aged from 4 to 14 billion years old since i was in school but rather than deduce that you call me dumb and ignorant ? with all of your so called intelligence can you prove the universe is now precisely 14 billion years old ? can you prove neanderthal man was a human descendant ? because <allcaps> dna </allcaps> tests dont prove that out and yet phds and masters degreed scientists insist they are . that ' s why the bible say ' s that the wisdom of this world is foolishness to god .	1

if you think marriage is sacred then why are you trying to change what it is ? i can not say this enough times . <repeated> marriage is a word that describes a union between man and women . no one created the word marriage and then decided what it would apply to . someone saw and event and gave this event a word . <repeated> this would be marriage . this ' event ' has been sacred since as long as we have records to show . and now , some wish to make it sacred for themselves while destroying the sacred institute that the majority of us wish to keep .	0

and why would i be anti christianity when i am christian ? oh and by the way to who ever it was who said i do not believe in jesus , or something to that extent , i never said anything to that extent , you just made up what you wanted and got mad about it . i believe in the teachings of jesus . yes i am betting your asking me how i know about his teachings if i have never read the bible , my mom is someone who has re - read the bible like 6 or 7 times . so she ' s told me all about it , and what its supposed to teach us .	0
no ! at conception we are a person and human . all living things belong to a species and the foetus is a living thing , for that reason a foetus must belong to a species , and that species is human . a fingernail is dead so cannot be considered a living human , nor will it develop into a human . the sperm only has half the chromosomes so is not human . the unique human is the key element here , if you cut your nail , the <allcaps> dna </allcaps> from the nail can be replicated by the living persons nail , a foetus when destroyed cannot have itself replicated , the unique <allcaps> dna </allcaps> that is destroyed will never be see on earth again , that individual has gone forever , howver , the man with the nail clipped is still alive .	0

wait so being bullied is infringing on your rights ? well no duh but if i ' bucko ' have to deal with it on a daily basis just for the fact that i am slightly different i am not surprised someone has to deal with it for their sexuality . and if they just dealt with the fact they were gay , accepted it and realized that other people are not the end all and be all , that they ' d eventually find people who accepted them for who they were and that high school wasn ' t the world maybe they ' d still be alive .	1

as i recall the order of feet was left front foot , right hind foot , left hind foot , and finally right front foot . does that make you happy . oh yes the genes involved are known as peds and numbered in order 1 - 4 . ped1 and ped4 are mirror images of each other ( obtained by a process known as reflective copy ) and ped2 and ped3 are much the same . this is of course entirely logical and could have been directed or random . the first critter to bear such feet was known as the ftse not to be confused with the index . its predecessors were of course the gimpy series since they had 1,2 , or 3 feet and had to hobble along with what they had . ftse - 1 is sometimes known as pogo because of its odd ' gait ' .	0
you know , if the god deniers even let the baby out of the mother ' s womb alive to begin with then he ' s already one step ahead of the game . as for what to do with him then , show me under the new covenant where jesus said to stone kids ? personally , i think we should stone obese , jaded statues of weird looking holy men .	1
fine lets just all be on our own , fuck government , fuck state , fuck town , fuck family , lets all do what we feel so long as it makes us happy . there has to be an order to things if not there will be chaos , history has proven this time and time again , but if you think that ' s the way to live be my guest , you will not live to long , the universe seeks balance and order not chaos . yes power will corrupt this is the reason for the system we have , like family , town , state , government and un to prevent the power hungry from taking over , it is up to us to prevent that from happening , we the people are the world not some lone wolf .	1
i am surprised no one has mentioned the subject of quantum mechanics in this thread . it seems to be a very good example of the concept , instead of perhaps parallel lines . the fact that things can exhibit mutually incompatible properties of either a particle or a wave depending on how we observe them is incomprehensible , yet certainly reality , no ? and i think this is just one example of the apparent incomprehensibility of qm . . .	0

have you ever considered the possibility that he cares about you ? that he knows you ? and that he cares about those in the womb ? this is always the charge hurled at me but it is never founded . you cannot find any misogyny in my writings but rather a great respect for women and their value and dignity . this is why i argue so strongly against abortion . yet , any oppression , or insecurity , or hardship , or difficulty they face , though real and challenging , is not justified in the face of destroying the life in the womb . though abortion reigns freely and forcefully and abundantly still the oppression and abuse of women endure . one reason they endure is that people are looking in the wrong place for a solution - - they are looking to abortion when it offers no solution .	0
but wouldnt it mean that if she ( if phunting is female ) burns in hell , that would mean that god really exists . do you believe in god ? also , do you think that if god really does exists that he ' s just bluffing about that hell stuff ? hmm <elongated> . <repeated>	1
i would agree with you , but first of all , the owner of the show has every right to not allow cameras . second , it would be a huge invasion of privacy if all women knew what their ex wives could keep spying on what they buy and what they do . they have no buisness doing that . very funny , but just because men do not want their rights violated by nosy ex wives and their lawyers and pis , does not mean that they love their guns any more than they do women . its simply a hobby . men do not insist on following women around , watching everything they buy and everything they do , do they ? men are entitled to guns just as women are entitled to manicures . our rights are going out the window fast .	1

i see the similarity with the original scripture , in which jesus was recognizing the authority of both god and caesar in the world . however , jesus was talking about the political power in the world . jesus called the academics of his day , vipers and hypocrits , because they pretended to be holy but were evil . he called the wisest of men fools , because they did not believe in god . also , as i stated before , truth should be the ultimate goal . i do not fear science . i do not see any truth that science may happen to reveal as a threat to faith . why ? because god is truth . jesus said , " and the truth shall set you free " ! <repeated>	0

actually jp so far 5 states have passed gay marriage so no not every time it is put to a vote do we lose . and how am i forcing anyone to accept gay marriage ? am i forcing these voters to attend my wedding or dare i say be in a marriage themselves ? and i cannot agree with you more about changing the image of the gay community as a whole . <repeated> we are not all a bunch of promiscuous sex crazed people running around . <repeated> what i find funny is once strait people find out how boring we really are , and how we pay taxes just like every other joe schmo they will think nothing more of special rights lol . <repeated> but actually like i stated earlier in another thread if those unions constituted the same legal rights as married couples i would be content .	0

child , your assumption is not only simplistic , childish and patently ridiculous , but it is coming from you so i am not surprised at all that you are making it . you can deduce and somehow read into my rejection of your statement being evidence of anything is claiming that christianity is the only religion , but i made clear above that my only intent was to show that your claim that your siggy proves anything at all is patently absurd . but make of it what you will . i will give you the last word to spew your lies and delusions about what you want to say i believe . so have at it little boy , er , i mean , child . emoticonxbye	1
