explain what you mean by the laws of physics . <happy> the laws of physics are short , descriptive statements that describe the operation of certain natural phenomena that always seem to occur in the same way . many times the " laws of physics " have been amended by further information , causing the law to be restated . actually , i think he meant the way that we have observed the universe and all of nature to operate .	0
the only reason that it will be a mac is because of the information that is still inside of the computer that should be removed if you want to take the whole brain . you have to remember that the human mind is not just a hard drive . it is also the processor ( brain ) as well as the motherboard ( connector of inputs and outputs ) and the ram ( short term memory ) . there is nothing else in the human body that can better fit the role of any of these four components . this is also the core of what determines if a computer is a mac or a pc . if you take all these pieces from your pc and put them in a mac then you have a pc . this is the case since you will be able to run pc - only applications and not mac - only applications . well , the actual personality of the computer is in the hard drive . ram really is not anything but a notebook , and the motherboard is more of a nervous system . so the processor and hardrive is the mind - the processor being the modivator , and the hard drive being the memory . if i were to take the intel p3 out and place an athlon <tong> 3000 + in it ' s place , would the computer be a different computer ? no . it would be the same computer .	0

i just say we make a law against abortion , and stop the genocide against the unborn . why end a human life on the basis size , development , and environment ? and i just say that it would be unjust and unfair of you to force metaphysical belief systems of your own which constitute religious belief upon your follows who may believe otherwise than you . get pregnant and treat your fetus as a full person if you wish , nobody will force you to abort it . let others follow their own beliefs differing or the same . otherwise you attempt to obtain justice by doing injustice . mo	0

each side tries to support their own worldview . there are two positions , and sides are chosen . it ' s human nature . yes . <happy> i can only speak for myself - winning converts is what the bible suggests , but i do not believe in doing it in a forceable way . i do not believe one person / one event wins a convert all at once , it takes a combination of many tiny little steps ( examples ) to win converts . my main reason for posting here is political . i do not believe it ' s possible to have neutrality in government . if church & state are separated , atheism and state are combined . atheism almost always equals secular " progression " , and judeo christianity almost always equals tradition , according to unchanging biblical morals . the two quickly clash in politics . also , i do not believe future generations ( school children ) are having the gaps in godless evolution explained to them clearly enough . i enjoy written debates very much , and i am trying to show how evolution can establish atheism in the u.s. government , in violation of the text of the first amendment and intent of the framers . i believe there has to be a god because i see no compelling evidence that life spontaneously generated from non living chemicals . i was brought up without anyone forcing me what to believe , and went to church occasionally . my church attendance did not get very regular until my late twenties - about twenty years ago . a few bible studies , comparing it to the flow of events , the nature of people , my shortcomings , the shortcomings of science etc , convinced me . though it does not really say why , the bible says that is what will happen . see matthew 7 : 13,14 . it ' s part of god ' s plan . free will . very well said , but remember , evolution doesnt mean atheism , but creationism means religion . i know christians that believe in evolution , but i dont know atheists that believe in creationism .	0

of course it will have an effect on the gay marriage issue . it will prevent the people of mass from voting on the issue and place the final decision in the hands of the pro gay democratic legislature who is owned and controlled by the gay lobby . it should also be noted that according to the mass constitution , the people have always voted on such issues . the democratic party controlled government wants to change the constitution against the will of the people who want to vote on this important issue . it ' s just another example of the liberals hijacking the historical political process and reforming it in their own image . but if this was a republican program , you ' d have no problem with it . you are a rightwing hypocrite , archie baby .	1

the record already acquired is amazingly good . it provides us with many detailed examples of a great variety of evolutionary phenomena on lower and intermediate levels and rather abundant data that can be used either by controlled extrapolation or on a statistical sampling basis for inferences as to phenomena on all levels up to the highest . among the examples are many in which , beyond the slightest doubt , a species or a genus has been gradually transformed into another . such gradual transformation is also fairly well exemplified for subfamilies and occasionally for families , as the groups are commonly ranked . <repeated> in spite of these examples , it remains true , as every paleontologist knows , that most new species , genera , and families appear in the record suddenly and are not led up to by known , gradual , completely continuous transitional sequences . george gaylord simpson , the major features of evolution ( new york : columbia university press , 1961 ) , pp 359 - 60 . notice that even in this version there are elipses just before the quote in question . my bet is if we were to actually refer to this 44 years old book , simpson would not be saying what toxey wants him to say .	0

just interjecting . <repeated> several of the letters attributed to paul were not writen by his hand according to most biblical scholars . ' most biblical scholars ' ? if you mean they think the letters are forgeries and were not at least dictated by paul , then it ' s just not true that most biblical scholars think that . i agree in terms of the idea that paul in some cases had someone else actually put the words on paper and he told them what to write , but that ' s pretty irrelevant here , <allcaps> imo </allcaps> .	0
therefore , we can conclude that teaching evolution is not teaching knowledge nor science , and as such , is teaching ignorance ( defined as lack of knowledge ) . so , all knowledge is ignorance , and all events not in the present are ignorance . i am not following you here . how about we leave the definitions as they are , so that we can differentate true from false ? calling everything ignorance does not move us forward in the debate . if we accepeted your claim , we are typing ignorance and concuding ignorance , so what would the point be ?	1

sinjin is quite content to register all firearms as has every dictator in history prior to confiscation . his compliments to the current system in kalifornia is nothing short of complete advocacy of registration and confiscation of privately owned firearms . what he does not want you to know is the depth of lawlesness and infringement is already in effect and is only working to punish innocent people and has nothing to do with crime control . <repeated> it is all about ultimate disarmament and loss of second amendment rights . there is a word for these people , now what was that ? i will not hold my breath awaiting a retraction of this piece of balderdash you have composed . guess we will chalk it up to puffery .	1
by the way , my personal opinion is that real scientists are trying to be objecticve and actually explore something before completely trashing it . and creationism was investigated and explored completely and shown to be false .	1
promoting renewables is a good thing , but increasing the supply of oil in counter productive in helping renewables to reach the critical mass needed to survive economically . if we could rub a brass lamp , make three wishes and fix our energy problems immediately , i ' d agree with you . but since we live in the <allcaps> real world </allcaps> , we must become <allcaps> oil independent </allcaps> while we are perfecting and building an infrastructure of renewable energy sources .	1
duh ! <repeated> i am surrounded by secular humanists and pseudo intellectual atheists who think evolution explains our origins . these are people who believe it and worship evolution like their religion as long as they do not have to believe in a personal god . emoticonxdonno so yeah , and it ' s spelled simpletons , there ' s no d in the word . emoticonxgood but that does not answer the question . why is dawkins a x <elongated> to believe as he does ? it seems that you have no answer except to throw out indiscriminate insults at people you know nothing about . in a previous post you stated , ' the guys a simpleton . ' that does not make sense as there is no verb in the sentence . ' guys ' is the plural of ' guy ' . you do not seem to be aware that the contraction for ' guy is ' is ' guy ' s . ' your error is caused by ignorance whereas trebor ' s is clearly a typo caused by the proximity of the ' e ' and ' d ' keys . do you have a better explanation for our origins that does not involve magic and dirt ?	0

scientifically , human may mean homo sapiens , but there are other methods of defining humans . one of them is their capacity to love and to worship . worship is not seen in another animal . some will argue whether or not animals actually love or if it is just a conditioned response to someone providing what is needed . i believe you have even debated that it is conditioned into humans to be religious and therefore it validates religions . so why is there a need to debate whether animals love if they are acting on a conditioned response ?	0
' what i find most interesting ' is to consider a humanity purged of the chronic scourge of rabid religion . how much more pleasant , and saner would the world be . and how many indigenous peoples around the planet would have continued to survive and thrive unmolested by what i consider the evilest of all manmade plagues , religion . but the question is can you prove your belief system is true ? and all you have done is spew hate for religion but have not even tried to actually answer the question . and ask yourself this . if the idea of god is such a man made plague , then god does not even exist right ? so if god does not exist then what has he done to you to make you so venomous and angry at him ? why would you be so angry at a non existent being ? i challenge you to come up with a rational answer .	1
<allcaps> an ak </allcaps> - 47 assault rifle , a high - calibre sniper rifle and machine guns are among a large cache of weapons uncovered by police in a sting operation culminating in a series of sydney raids . undercover officers bought a range of illegal guns , including the ak - 47 , over a series of months from a targeted supplier . in a similar raid yesterday , in powder works road , elanora heights , officers seized a large cache of weapons . it included a 22 magnum revolver , a 12 - gauge shotgun , a . 410 calibre shotgun and ammunition , two . 22 calibre rifles , two lee enfield . 303 bolt - action rifles , a m6 scout dual calibre shotgun / rifle , a . 270 calibre bolt - action rifle , a . 45 calibre muzzle loading rifle , a 22 - 250 calibre bolt - action rifle andxa martini action rifle . i know , maybe the american criminals will just import guns in with their mexican illegal drugs . i do not know for sure but i believe the mexican drug gangs would not mind another revenue stream . net results , zilch , nada , zero . but you know that ! emoticonxsmilie gun control is nothing but a scam !	1

anti - choicers do not give two whits about life , or really believe in the absolute value of a fetus . this story is a good example of that . i bet a lot of so - called " pro - lifers " would support this court ' s decision , even though the mother posed no real threat , and she could have miscarried the fetus : for anti - choicers , it ' s just about control and power over women . they do not care about life . ( except their own . ) this same mother could be a person who did not have access to pre - natal care . they would not defend that right either . because they <allcaps> don </allcaps> ' t care about the fetus . they do not care about life . they do not care about health . they care about power and money and pushing people around . that ' s all . that ' s quite a leap , even for you . how did you know that the officiers were pro - life ? or that any pro - life people would condone the officiers ' behavior in this instance . i certainly think it was excessive . i guess i must not be pro - life by your illogic .	1
what you mean is that we should pretend that creationism has some sort of legitimate basis in reality ? the definitions were accurate . it would be different if someone could actually offer a scientific theory of creation . how about some evidence to support the " theory . " by the way , i am still waiting for you to tell us about how the definition of evolution has changed . what you really meant was the creationists had invented bogus definitions so that they could lump all of science under " evolution , " wasn ' t it ? wow . <repeated> you are bent on harping on creationists arguments at whatever the cost . first of all , you are not even considering that the majority of people are misinformed of what evolution is not because they have creationist motives , but because they go to the dictionary for definitions	0
ah , well , then you in you ' broad and unprejudiced view ' emoticonxrolleyesemoticonxrolleyes can obviously tell us those supposed myriad other views . i wait with bated breath for your answer . the simple and most usual one would be bluntly that marriage is and always has been between members of the opposite sex . there may possibly have been some strange aberrations in the past but essentially that has always been the bottom line even for homosexuals . in addition to those there will be those who oppose it on religious grounds . and why should not they if they so wish ? marriage is an institution not a right . if you do not qualify then you do not enter . by all means campaign to have the rules changed but do not be surprised if they are not .	0
i support legalization of every drug . i am sure most of you are young and have been fed <allcaps> x <elongated> </allcaps> like " marijuana will kill you . " actually it does less damage to the brain then alcohol and it cannot kill you . it is impossible . it takes 20,000 joints in one sitting to overdose on marijuana . alcohol however kills thousands of americans each year from alcohol poisoning . you know that idiot pothead . he did not get dumb from pot , he got dumb from birth . marijuana does not have long term effects on iq . the only side effect is the lazy side effect . the day after a person tends to be more lazy however it is like a hang over . <repeated> it only lasts for a day . there is no reason why it should remain illegal . i also support all drugs being legalized because the drug war has failed . we spend billions each year on the drug war and i can call someone right now and pick up some crack . it is a failure . what we should do is make it government controlled and then spend the money to fight drugs on drug education . flood the schools with <allcaps> actual </allcaps> info about how herion kills and how it breaks a person down . tell the kids how you can die from one use of coke . tell them the short term and long term effects of each drug . if we can educate our kids and even adults through an ad campaign about what drugs do to you then we could save far more people . also allowing drugs to be regulated will lower the prices and effectively kill drug dealers and gangs off the streets . there are so many benefits to legalizing drugs . anyone want to fight it ? i have proof to back up what i say and also have the effects of each drug . recent studies apparently show that pot is more harmful than you say . one joint is said to contain more carcinogens than four tobacco cigarettes . i doubt your 20,000 joints theory . you have a simplistic argument going for pot . i can not agree that legalizing all drugs would be a good thing either . programs in holland have failed to produce significant if any benefits to society in general . the druggies seem to have benefitted by having arrest - free drug zones and access to whatever they want , but the cost of drugs still requires some income , something that most of them likely do not have other than from crime , begging or social programs . one " benefit " i see from legalizing drugs is that the users could be more easily identified .	0
the whole point is that you can not use this warped version of the razor for hypothesis testing . in the example , impetus was a hypothesis for a cause for movement . ockham eliminated the hypothesis as a description of the phenonmenon . and if there are two competing hypotheses that are actually hard to choose between ? as they get closer , it becomes less possible to choose by instinct or testing . a principle comes in handy .	0

the idea of abortion as population control is absurd , especially forced abortions as someone mentioned a few posts ago . anyone who has read a biology book knows the world has methods of population control on its own , we do not need to be doing stuff like that ourselves . this stat sounds more than a bit inflated . seeing as it comes from a website called " women ' s issues " it is probably not all that credible . you question others sources and credibility yet you parade around under the name of a giant cartoon shake ?	1

yup , dismissing spirituality <emphasis> selfishly , one can conveniently substitute religions like " legal - ism " . so , a human - mother is equal to the abilities / wisdom of god now ? - interesting thing : how many mothers do you <emphasis> know , who can successfully champion <emphasis> a person ( hiding in coma - states of mind ) ? annie hmm <elongated> , a mere human - mother cannot make decisions concerning her own body , but you , sk8joyful , can usurp the position of god and tell another human , especially a mere human - mother , what she is allowed to do with her body .	1
susan smith shocked the nation with the murder of her children . she believed her two young boys were an obstacle to remarriage , so she placed them in her car , fastened their seat belts , and drove them into the lake . smith ' s crime was especially obscene because she violated the most fundamental moral obligation of all : the responsibility a mother has for her own children . yet would not susan smith be exonerated by thompson ' s and mcdonagh ' s logic ? these children were kidnappers and interlopers , trespassing on smith ' s life , depriving her of liberty . why not kill them ? those boys were attacking her . it was self - defense . last year , a couple in new york was arrested when authorities learned they took a 10 - day vacation to florida and left their young children behind to fend for themselves . if mcdonagh ' s and thompson ' s arguments work , these parents should be released from jail because they bear no more obligation towards their own children than they do to strangers across town or burglars who break into their house . those children were invading their privacy , trespassing in their home , stealing their food . all born children , and every woman had the right to be rid of them . killing them is not required as abortion is when they are in the womb ( during the timeframe the majority of abortions occur , at least ) . they are not comparable .	0
democrats are not clean and pure as the wind driven snow , they do not have an absolute birthright to govern , and they certainly are not the only ones qualified to govern ! um , bassman , so you , the one person in the world who is as " pure as the wind - driven snow , " is the one who may judge others , including democrats . um , for the record i grew up on the prairie and saw a goodly bit of " wind - driven snow " and it was not particularly pure . a feeble and laughable metaphor .	1
we are up to our eyeballs in " intermediate fossils " , yet along comes a creationist to ask : " where is the intermediate fossible which should be there between 1027 and 1028 ? clearly evolution is a fraud !

. <repeated> if we see relatively few creationists on these boards , all that means is , theres relatively few creationists on these boards . that does not prove anything . right ? lets do some thinking here . <repeated> but the point is why are there relatively few creationists . the reason is that the creationist position cannot be defended in open debate . that is why creationist boards censor opposing views . on boards where creationists are not protected there are few .	0
600 ? oh really ? looks like the following scriptures are vague enough that they could apply to anything and nothing at the same time . making vague enough comments can easily look prophetic . the fact that there are not specifics is a key failure in your argument . if the bible was truly prophetic and scientifically accurate , terms that would easily be seen as represenativive of the natural force would be found everywhere , yet they are not . you are talking a little and making it to be far more then it is . once again , anything vague enough can be taken for anything in any light under any condition . well , i guess you can refuse to see something that ' s pretty obvious . it ' s up to you .	1

i think this is unlikely under the current makeup of the supreme court . but that of course is the fear that many have , i . e . , that gay marriage would be imposed via judicial fiat ( whether at the state or federal level ) rather than through legislative means . well , let us be honest here . people fear gay marriage , not that it might come about via judicial fiat . that ' s just the current whipping horse because that ' s how it happened first , for some broad values of judicial fiat of course . there was a recent post here about rights granted gays by their state legislature , oregon i think , and a group jumped in and forced the law on hold via a petition drive . so it really is not the means by which gays get equality that upsets some folks , it ' s the equality itself . " judicial fiat " is just a phrase people can use so they can avoid stating their true motives , preventing gays from being treated as equals .	0
ludacris and many others in the hip hop scene disrespect women with their lyrics and videos . much of what hip hop puts out contributes to unwanted pregnancies . i think hip hop and the arts are reflections of society . it is good to bring these issues to light , if only so that those who would not normally be aware of them are enlightened .	0

( which you did not answer , but rather basically said ' i do not know but rest assured they do ' ( to paraphrase ) . get it now ? anyway , on further review , i believe that the bills only apply to whatever falls under the catagory of ' civil rights ' , however the heck that is to be determined ! emoticonxdonno	0

i think this might be the wrong thread for this discussion . something like this belongs in the crime debate area , where i am currently handing jo his head over and over again . you lie . you keep saying the same things over and over again , that does not make them true . your addiction to violence is showing . tony martin shot an unarmed 16 year old kid in the back as he was running away . that ' s not self - defence , that ' s cold blooded murder . it is not the role of individuals to exact revenge for crimes committed against them . you do not get to take the law into your own hands . munir hussain ran after the intruders and beat them up with a cricket bat in the street . that ' s not self - defence , that ' s revenge .	0

and you never know when a word of god will touch you , because the word itself is spiritual . for the word of god is living and active . sharper than any double - edged sword , it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit , joints and marrow ; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart . - hebrews 4:12 the word touched me in a bad place . <repeated> i think it was at summer camp or something . <repeated> i am still scarred . <repeated> no but seriously even i do not believe that . <repeated> how exactly is word spiritual ? is it intentional ? based upon the interpretation an individual gets from it ? seeing as how the history of the bible itself and it ' s original writings , many interpretations , denominations , and debates over itself is construed it can hardly be seen as itself being spiritual . is it possible that through god the manuscripts and texts stir inside a person a level of spirituality ? yes . but when you go buy a bible at barnes and noble it certainly is not glowing with the essence of god . <repeated> it ' s debated if even the ark of the covenant itself if it still exists has the essence of god to this day . <repeated>	0
it seems that the creationists are beginning to change there views . evolution can be explained by science but creation relys on myth , superstition and hope , but few people are now suggesting that the two theories can be explained together , god started everything then evolution took over . its like the creationist is trying to put one over the evolutionist by suggesting that god created evolution . but in reality i think a person who believes in creation is coming to terms that the creation theory is a bit far fetched and the evolution theory makes more sense , but due to religious conditioning still continue to grasp on the creation theory . which really means the bible would be disregarded as a source of information . yes , some people are jumping ship , which is a crying shame . <allcaps> stick to your guns men </allcaps> ! we ' <allcaps> re winning </allcaps> !	1

the number of people that do this is irrelevant , alls that counts is the very fact that it happens , and so it invalidates the the sweeping statement that suggested otherwise . even then , your statement does nothing . they are not " getting themselves pregnant " . a doctor is doing a medical procedure , that may or may not result in a pregnancy ( ya know , those little sperm thingies ? ) emoticonxangel	1
so they ( pro - life peeps ) say abortion is murder . of course , you can only murder people . so their rule is that fetuses ( feti ? ) are people also . but then they can not explain why fetuses are not listed on the us census , or why there is not a funeral every time a woman has a miscarriage . pretty much , along with the rules of having children , you would have to acquire the birth certificate during conception , you would have to pay taxes for children , even if you are only pregnant , etc . or am i missing something ? care to clarify , anybody who disagrees ? yes , you are missing something . how come age does not start at conception ? how come when babies are born they are not 9 months old instead of , well , seconds old .	0

are you seriously claiming all christians believe this ? even when i was a christian , i did not believe all that . virgin mary ? you gotta be kidding me . even as a catholic , that did not make any sense . this creed strains credulity to the utmost , and i suspect you will find lots of christians who do not accept it literally . i can not vouch for what others believe . the creeds are a pretty accurate summary of my beliefs as regards who and what god is . the apostles ' creed is the statement of belief used at baptism in most of christianity , so it would be strange for someone to have been baptised ( or confirmed if they were baptised as an infant ) without believing this to be true . to be honest i am surprised by the idea that people ( outside the pseudo - christian sects like the mormons and jehovah ' s witnesses ) who claim to be christians would not believe what is stated in the creeds , it ' s not something that really occurred to me . i know that some people misunderstand the use of the word catholic in the last paragraph but that ' s about it .	0

and again , it was only written that way in that era to limit the federal government from making laws that give preference to one religion or another ; i . e . anothers persons faith could not receive preferential treatment over your own . the 1 4 th amendment further says that the states cannot pass any laws the abridge the rights you have as a federal citizen so a state cannot pass a law either that gives preference to a different faith than your own , the same limitation as the federal government . if you want to use this arguement then you are assuming a right to free speech seperate from the 1 st amendment . you are applying the first amendment but rather assuming ' free speech ' is a right granted outside of the constitution . i believe our argument is dealing with applying the first amendment to the states . the case did not deal with the first amendment at all . where did you get that idea from ? it dealt with religion but that is about as close as it gets . ok ? was there ever any doubt that the 1 st amendment was incorporated since cantwell ?	0

this outta be good . a creationist actively making himself look like a complete idiot . normally we have to pay for kind of entertainment . besides , even if he somehow manages to prove that ridiculous claim , that does not actually prove god . like i said , normally we have to pay for kind of entertainment . whoa ! duo . give the kid a chance . it seems that you are skeptical that he can offer empirical ' proof ' that his god exists . certainly , since he is a ' philosophy and theology ' major he must understand the implications of ' proof ' in the context of science , as well as the meaning of the term ' empirical ' . after all , would not those ideas be something that a philosopher would be expected to understand ? so let us await his ' empirical proof ' without laughter . wait until he presents his ' empirical proof ' before we laugh .	1

as far as i can see , evolutionists agree that natural selection is how we have evolved for microscopic life forms . to me this means that a single organism in a species mutates , giving it and its offspring an advantage over the rest of the population . if this mutation is random does not that mean that the gene pool for every species would be very small as , in the long run , only the offspring of the mutated species would survive ? in some cases yes , in others no . if the mutation gives a huge advantage , then there will be a decline in the size of the gene pool for a while ( eg when the australian rabbit population was reduced form 500 million to 100 million by myxomatosis , the gene pool strunk as a result and the genetic " mutation " that gave increased resistance spread throughout the whole population as a result ) . most of the time though single mutations do not have such a huge advantage and so genetic variation is maintained .	0
the classic anti - gunner misinterpretation . what i am advocating is that we stop this naive belief that we can save lives by banning guns on and around school property , because the victims of columbine and virginia tech will tell you that this belief is wrong . despite this inane fear that so many have , there are not going to be shootouts between students and teachers over a d - term paper . how do i know this ? because the people that have permits to legally carry guns are not murdering each other over dented fenders , parking spots and disagreements over which football team is best . furthermore the 1,000 foot gun free proximity zone around the school is totally useless . it does nothing to ensure or promote safety , it ' s just a big inconvenience to people who live near a school , and a potential trap to anybody who ' s traveling to or from the local range . should you really be guilty of breaking a federal law by simply having a gun while being 999 feet away from a school , while your friend who ' s 1,001 feet away from the same school , with a gun , is completely innocent and not facing felony charges ? the intelligent answer in this case would be ' no ' . you said there that you wanted guns in schools so that kids could defend themselves . how is that a misinterpretation ? you are asking for proof of a negative . how many massacres would have occured if guns were common in school ? we do not know . <repeated> erm . <repeated> you are saying that people do not try to harm one another over those things ? i suggest you surf youtube for a bit . rememeber however , that kids are more emotionally unstable than adults . hormones and guns are not a good combination . i agree that ' s silly . i am more worried about your statement that students should carry in class .	0

in 1927 , supreme court justice oliver wendell holmes jr . declared it " better for all the world " if the " manifestly unfit " could be stopped from reproducing . " three generations of imbeciles are enough , " he famously wrote in his ruling in buck v . bell , which affirmed the constitutionality of forced sterilization of people deemed genetically inferior . . . . in the mid - 1800 ' s . . . the british polymath sir francis galton . . . introduced the idea of intelligence as an inherited trait and . . . developed a science to promote it , which he named eugenics . in america , galton ' s ideas were picked up by the biologist charles davenport , who in 1904 established cold spring harbor laboratory on long island as a national center for eugenics research and policy planning . . . . davenport created a eugenics records office and recruited an ambitious young high school teacher named harry laughlin to join him in an enormous project that sent fieldworkers across the country to identify the " germ - plasm " of unfit family strains so that it could be eradicated . laughlin became an influential developer of american compulsory sterilization policy , which had officially begun in 1907 when indiana passed a law allowing scientists to use surgical methods to eradicate the unfit . . . . he helped congress formulate the 1924 immigration act , which kept out " inferior " people from southern and eastern europe . bruinius deftly plays up the contrast between the eugenicists ' obsession with cold measurements of human value and their own messy lives , which were marked by disease and behavior that could have qualified them as unfit : galton suffered from severe depression ; davenport had one child who was sickly and another who was apparently dyslexic ; and laughlin was afflicted with epilepsy . in america and elsewhere , enthusiasm for eugenics was broadly supported by elites . in britain , people as varied as winston churchill and george bernard shaw embraced its goals , and there was lively debate about how much the state itself should control reproduction of individuals . eugenic science especially appealed to fabian socialists , who saw it as further justification for abolishing class — after all , once the playing field was level the effect of heredity could finally express itself clearly and be studied . in this country , eugenic theory and practice engaged the likes of theodore roosevelt , the birth control crusader margaret sanger and leaders of the carnegie and rockefeller foundations . it galvanized temperance advocates , suffragists , and liberal american churches and synagogues . citizens enthusiastically entered " fitter family " and " better baby " contests . from a book review of <allcaps> better for all the world </allcaps> : the secret history of forced sterilization and america ' s quest for racial purity by harry bruinius : <url> teddy roosevelt , winston churchill , the rockefeller foundations , millions of americans , the state of indiana . . . all these embraced the concept of <allcaps> eugenics </allcaps> . interesting , yes ?	0

i can not recall the name of this particular fallacy , but if i were to name it it would be the " if it were possible , someone would have done it already " fallacy , the consistent application of which leads one to believe it is impossible for anything to happen for the first time . no peeling , it would be , " we proved it was possible to evolve as humans have , so why can only we do it ? " why has not one other creature on earth ever evolved to our level of sophistication in the same alleged 4 billion years that we have had to attain our level of evolution ? if evo is real , then it seems only right that it should touch all species equally and that all species that were not forced into extinction , but survived and overcame the pressures they faced should have ended up in a similar evolved place that man has attained in 4 billion years . unless of course that the science of evolution is a humanistic justification to explain our origins but has no basis in fact what so ever . and that is my claim and belief .	0

surely you understand that this is not the same as providing evidence for creationism . disproving one theory does not prove another . all it does is disprove a theory . yes i do understand this . but you must admit that the instantaneous formation of a living organism , even an extremely primitive one , complete with the complexity of the <allcaps> dna </allcaps> code as a result of random encounters of atoms and molecules is a little too much to buy . there is evidence right there for creationism . only intelligence could have formed such an elaborate complex system for the structure of life and its propagation .	0

sounds like a fact which has been blown out of all proportion - possibly by the pro - gun side attempting to ridicule it . it is a fact , however , that the presence of a gun can increase aggression levels in individuals . see other times i have brought this up , here ( to the end of the thread ) and here ( again , that post till the end of the thread ) . you should really think about what you say before you say it . i have heard this before and its garbish , i have been around and owned guns my whole life and i have never , not even once , had the thought of getting a gun just because someone # # # # # # me off . i would never use a gun on a person unless that person were a viable threat to my life , such as coming at me with a knife for example .	1
citizens would need to have machine guns , bazookas , shoulder launched missiles , tanks , blackhawk helicopters , i agree , for the most part . once you get to tanks and helicopters though ? too big , too easy a target for a tyrannical regime . do you see the iraqis and afghanis using tanks and helicopters ? i am sure they could get them if they really wanted , but they are useless against a government that invests in satellite technology and bombers . better to stick with the rocket launchers and mines .	0

if information came into being by chance , how can we know that anything is true ? how do you know what is false and what is " true " ? if we are just products of chance , your brain is also a product of chance . therefore , the thought patters that determine your logic are also products of chance . if your logic is the result of chance processes , you can not even be sure it evolved properly . you can not even be sure you can reason properly ( using your definition ) because you can not trust your own logic . sounds like the same skeptic argument above . i do not know about you nu leader , but when i am certain my mind exists . are you not certain ? you are actually required to be , to deny you exist would require existence , and that would be logically contradictory .	0

good god ! i well know the difference between an aryan person and the cult of arianism . there would be absolutely no reason at all to discuss a relatively unknown and ancient religious cult in a junior high level history book . but all sorts of hidden reasons to bring up the topic of aryans in a racist southern state . allright , well then i think it ' s odd too , arians would have made more sense . i am surprised they are considered obscure , the council of nicea is historically considered one of the defining moments of the early christian church , and the arian controvery was it ' s main event . for the record , they were discussed in my high school , that ' s why i was making sure .	0
it is an absract concept , but i draw attention to the fact that no man can speak on this issue with the perspective that a woman can by virtue of the fact they can never be pregnant . so i suggest that it is very easy to say something is wrong when you cannot appreciate the fullness of the issue - a man will never be placed in the situation where they will be pregnant but do not wish to have a baby at that point . by your logic , do i have to be a murdered to understand that murder is wrong ? this ' walk a mile in my sandals ' stuff is just bs . i do not have to be a woman to view abortion as not being moral .	1
and you just sound ignorant . you would not make this statement if you knew about how britain ' s current gun control laws came into existence . you / he could just have said ' slippery slope ' in the first place ; that argument is an old one , which i though was dealt with a long time ago . you can not disapprove of a on the grounds that it might lead to b - firstly because you have little to no evidence that it will , secondly because a is not necessary for b to happen and thirdly because that difference between a and b is all the argument you need to prevent b but be in favour of a . you can approve of punishing criminals but be against the death sentance .	0

this is what i do not understand . on the one hand we have iranians going on about death to america . on the other our own president is constantly making statements about spreading democracy and toppling current regimes in the me . is one any worse than the other ? i still contend that mad solves most of the problems with nuclear proliferation . sure , some of the iranians are crazy ( as are some american leaders ) , but they are not stupid . they are not going to use nukes as offensive weapons if it is going to ensure their own destruction in retaliation . reminds me of the cold war clamor of necessary ' defense ' nuclear weapon parity with russia . considering the threats we make directed towards iran and others along with our occupation of iraq , i am surprised our conceit has not made all of me and asia scramble for nukes . pakistan , 97% muslim , hides bin laden , governed by a general constantly avoiding assassination attempts , never a bad word about that us ' ally ' . but they have nukes and delivery systems . i ' d think iran believes , as we have shown , that the us does not spew the democracy at the point of a gun policy to those nations possessing nuclear weapons .	0
is this the same kent hovind found guilty of tax evasion ? i dunno where christians get their morals from , but it can not be the same place as professional creationists . the big bang theory may not be the last word from science on cosmology , by i can not see a no - good , talentless hack like hovind , or any other professional creationist crank , providing us with any insights into it . well he can defend his tax difficulties by claiming he is a creationist and thus cannot be trusted with quantitative processes involving a bit of mathematics . then again he can tell <allcaps> irs </allcaps> that <allcaps> god </allcaps> will provide and they should contact bush to get gods cell number . i am sure that <allcaps> irs </allcaps> , <allcaps> god </allcaps> , and hovind can work it all out .	1
my friend , it was not dishonest , if it was i would work out my salvation with fear and trembling . i suppose if you truly believe its not dishonest to repeat anothers ideas as if they were your own . i will keep this in mind the next time i have to write a paper . woe betide any professor who accuses me of plagiarism , for he is trampling my religious freedoms !	1
yeah , it is pretty stupid to think that drilling in one potential oil field would affect the market price significantly at all . there is a way to reduce your gas bill , though : drive less . or get a hybrid . or carpool . but it is quite impossible to reason financially with one who holds the most idiotic of fisical ideas . it still amuses me that vor thinks a cd during low inflation is a good idea . hey , why is it that vor has cowardly fled from virtually every argument i met him in ? btw vor , everytime you say something that is just financially idiotic , i am going to bring up the cd comment .	1
those who have firearms in their homes are more likely to die of murder would that be legaly owned guns , or criminals who have guns ( and also ues guns ) for there crimes ? most gang members have guns , if they are killed in a drive by shooting , is the gun responsable , or would it be the illegal activitys ?	0
what makes a rape and incest baby any less precious then a regular baby and why it is okay to abort them but not the later ? no baby is more precious than another as far as my personal beliefs go it is no more alright to terminate a baby concieved through rape / incest than it is to terminate a baby classed as a mistake / inconvenience .	0

it has moved on to the scientific theory of evolution . hmm , so given this exhibition of ignorance of what evolution is , you are saying that because you never heard of mutations , evolution does not work ? that ' s a problem with your ignorance , not with the scientific theory of evolution . it changes ratios of gene alleles in a population . , which certainly fits the definition of evolution ( namely , " the changes in alleles in a population over generational time ) . " rm & ns " ? <repeated> but then , there also is absolutely no evidence for such an intelligence . false . quite . but then neither does many living systems . unless you deliberately engage in revisionist linguistic hyperbole to change the definition of " purposefully " or " intelligently , " your argument is outright false . blatantly false . blatantly false . blatantly false . what is this ? some kind of " i will will make a false presentation of living entities and use this falsehood to disprove evolution " # # # # ? if your argument is based on outright falsehoods like you just did , then the output will be false as well . remember the old computer programmer term - " garbage in , garbage out . " hey dane , you are real good at calling people ignorant , sanctimoniously declaring everything they say as false , blatantly false , or falsehoods . but would it be too much to ask for you to back up your rejection of berts arguments with anything more than insults ? like some actual facts for example ?	1
illinois just allowed 167 death row inmates released from death row . just in case one of them might not be guilty . i say , what about the other 166 that are guilty ? just so you know peach , the 167 death row inmates are now serving life in prison . at least that one who ' s not guilty might now have a chance to be free .	0
how could they be ' accurate ' and be wrong ? there is nothing ' less accurate ' about that , it is wrong ! i think you have been reading too much george orwell , you have come up with new speak for science . really ? so suppose that you have two models for the way the solar system works . you measure where the planets are today in the night sky , and you use both models to predict where the planets will be ten years from now . in ten years you make actual measurements . the predictions of the first model for mars are off by , say , a tenth of a minute of arc . the second model is off by a hundredth of a minute of arc . ( for comparison , the full moon in the sky has a width of about 30 minutes - - i may be wrong about this ) . so , are you saying the first model is wrong ? the error seems to be pretty tiny ( by most standards ) . what about the second ?	0

erakat pointed to the israeli - palestinian interim agreement , covering the west bank and gaza , that was signed by the united states , israel , palestinian authority , european union , russia , jordan , egypt and norway . that agreement specified that no member of the palestine liberation organization will be arrested or brought to court for any action that happened prior to september 13, 1993 , the day the oslo accord was signed , erakat said . there was no immediate response from the united states to erakat ' s claims . soon after abbas ' capture , u.s. officials said u.s. indictments of abbas for piracy , hostage - taking and conspiracy have apparently expired , although they could be renewed . u.s. officials said abbas ' fate - - whether he will be sent to an italian prison or face a u.s. trial - - is " unresolved . " <url> so , i am wondering , did you neglect to note the reason because you " forgot " or because it would weaken your statement and its connotation that we really did not want him that badly ? emoticonxconfused	1
i am not in the least surprised . <repeated> i stated that it was required by law . <repeated> i never said anything about when it became a requirement . as of now , in the year 2010 applying for a ss number is required . <repeated> would you say that is an invasion of privacy ? . <repeated> and for your information clinton wasn ' t the first or last president to rape the social security program . <repeated> politicians have been using it as a personal bank for decades . why do not you answer bryan ' s post above troll ? he has some important information you would never figure out by yourself ?	1
i see you missed the point again ! youre not exactly a very bright person are you ? by the way you forgot to mention : think , behave morally , and have concern for the future . if homosexuals do not think , how can they choose to become good vaginal penetrators ? the fact is , the more homosexuality there is , the less abortions . if you were a gay you could rest assured that your man - wife would never abort once . are you willing to sacrifice the lives of billions of innocent children to your personal feelings like lust towards vaginas ?	1
there are many problems with society depending on which part of society one belongs to . i do not know that i ' d call them a series because some are unrelated . there ' s a serious problem of apathy in education . people do not seem to want to learn . i am in total agreement with that statement . unfortunately , parents are passing that mindset on to their children . the us experienced a decline in college enrollment in 2005 , which speaks volumes about us lower education and personal motivation , at the very time other nations have accelerated their production of graduates in science and engineering . we will end up paying a dear economic price for that circumstance . on the bright side , we have a large surplus of business majors to manage our service industry , the down side being their lack of basic reading and writing skills .	0

i think this is rather simple . there will be a decrease in volume or quantity of healthcare services . this will not include time of doctors who mostly tell their spport staff to do yet another test . so it will mostly include support staff , administrative staff , equipment manufacturers . they will not necessarily get paid less , there will just be fewer of them . per person that is . well to get healthcare from $6000 per person to $3,400 per person you ' d have to pay them less or fire them . so do i understand you correctly that we will either cut pay or fire doctors and nurses ? <allcaps> edit </allcaps> : that seems dramatic . <repeated> not " fire " them but they will basically go into another profession since they are no longer needed .	0

assuming this right exists . <repeated> you could say that you have no right to kill it though , you can only try to starve it . - you have consented sex and get pregnant . the pregnancy is a direct consequence that was known when having sex . - you have consented to a stranger coming into your house to eat dinner . the stranger coming in and sitting down and using your plates and eating your food is a direct consequences of you inventing him in for dinner . - if you say you do not want the unborn to " live off you " anymore then the only thing you can do is starve it because you can not kill it as it did nothing that it was not allowed to do until just now . - you have decided the stranger must go , however , you do not have a right to kill him right there as you did not give him any reasonable time to leave . you could put the stranger out even if they had nowhere to go and it was freezing cold out .	0
a person is a person no matter how small . <url> that ' s just darling , and all . but it still does not indicate that a fetus is a small person . no one denies it ' s alive . no one denies it is of the species homo sapiens . no one denies that an embryo can ultimately become as person , which is the simplistic point of that cloying article . it is personhood of the fetus that is the debate . i do not think it can ever be definitively determined . using dr . seuss was an excellent choice of reference to back your argument , however . i am not sure why you quoted shooter ' s post about a death sentence . however , if you really equate abortion with murder , are you willing to advocate charging the mother and doctor with premeditated murder ?	0
well , i just did my top three , a top 10 would have had a bit more variety . i place rw extremos higher than lw ones because they are more likely to call for war , be racist and be homophobic . also , many black panthers are already covered in the racist heading . again , many people are jerks . be homophobic . <repeated> like the naacp ? oh wait , they are left wing . call for war . <repeated> like the democrats for vietnam ? oh wait , they are left wing . be racist . <repeated> like claim that minorities can not help themselves ? oh wait , that ' s also left wing . sir . <repeated> you have engaged in stereotyping . <repeated> that makes you . <repeated> hmm .	1

i am not disguising one thing . i am always clear that my argument is equal marriage for same sex couples . no one i know on my side argues simply for " equality in marriage " , period full stop . right , expect when talking about the 1 4 th amendment . the way you guys like to define " equal protection " would make it so any restriction is unequal .	1
i would venture that the acquisition of property is still a component of the pursuit of happiness but since the supply of wannabe property owners has outpaced the supply of property , i would venture that a libertarian ' s pursuit of happiness now involves activities pertaining his penis - providing that he can remain straight and sober long enough to make such activities worthwhile this is begging so many darn quesions it ' s boggling my mind !	1
you are against it for reasons of your personal religious beliefs , because marriage is a " sacrament " . this is not the only group who has a different idea on the sacrament of marriage , or believes in a different type of god or no god , as i pointed out earlier . however , it is gays that should not be accomodated ? i am against polygamy , marriages with underaged minors and marriages to livestock as well , so do not feel that you are the only ones not " accomodated " .	1
indeed . it relies on an all powerful unrestrained government to run the businesses , ( otherwise privet persons get rich can not have that ) and distribute wealth amongst the population . but at the same time requires that same government to be genuinely benevolent which does not happen 9 times out of 10 when you give a person or group of people that kind of power they will abuse it . not to mention that stalin alone killed more of his own people that hitler killed jews . not to mention all the other communist leaders that also committed genocides . mao , pol pot , castro , chaves , etc . the nazis are guilty of attempted genocide compared to those guys . while i can not say i am a history buff , i am not shocked about all that either . perhaps it ' s because i am mostly a misanthropist .	0
the gun control act of 1968 , which initiated the background check requirement , was written by liberal politicians ; the main people who support gun control laws . it was these same gun control nuts that chose to intentionally not require private transfers to involve background checks . you missed the opportunity back in 1968 , you have no room to gripe about it now . shut up . i was eight at the time . i will read up and get back to you . mind your manners .	1

i too believe that abortion is murder , however a ) bombing a clinic involves the chance of killing other people - what about the postman delivering a package to the clinic . b ) there are , in these cases i believe , other means of ' protest ' c ) if you do protest you should also be willing to support women who choose not to have an abortion . <repeated> responsibility on this issue goes much deeper . but you said that you saw standing aside whilst someone murdered another was cowardly ? : : sigh : : let me simplify for you . do you kill someone to prevent a murder ?	1

i do not see that either of them were " protesting " . i would however say that they were both making a statement . cindy even makes it clear in her letter that she was making a statement . now i certainly think that cindy should have been simply removed rather than arrested , but whats done is done . i am glad to see that the senators wife was removed as well . i have nothing against the positions expressed on either of their shirts . i do however believe that the only one who should be making a statement at the <allcaps> sotu </allcaps> is the president , and therefore i would in the future support the removal of anyone who follows this path . perhaps a dress code would eliminate this <allcaps> x <elongated> </allcaps> in the future . apparently decorum means nothing anymore . true they should have passed raincoats and knee boots to protect peoples clothes from the <allcaps> x <elongated> </allcaps> that the president was spewing out .	1

i wonder , how do all the other democracies manage to survive without the protection of a heavily armed citizenry ? does this mean that the found fathers of america realised that they were not to be trusted ? <allcaps> yes </allcaps> ! the founding fathers realized government was to serve the people it governed . with out a set of rules that limited the government it would run wild ( as england did ) . they made the bill of rights and constitution so that it would limit the government ( to keep it from becoming too powerful , and overstepping it ' s bounds ) . and the only way the constitution could actually be enforced was for the population to uphold it . back in the time of it ' s writing they probably saw the best way for a population to force a government to not over step it ' s bounds was to force it . <repeated> er . <repeated> by force . today in the information age , a much better weapon is our right to vote . sweeping changes can be implemented with out the use of force using the system .	0

first of all , we are supposed to be introducing ourselves , not starting up a topic . but let me kill two birds with one stone here . hi everyone , i am new here . and i love to debate . i got kicked out of one debate , because i won the debate on linguistics , and the girl got mad , because she lost , and banned me from the froum . hopefully no one here is as immature as that . but anyway , thats my story , i am glad to be here . and i am ready to debate . and here is my first victim . i am against gay marriages . why ? ! <repeated> because in order to mantain a healthy environment for children . ( which they always seem to want to adopt ) there has to be a healthy relationship . now a child grows up , and sees two men / women dating eachother . that can confuse the child as to whether they should also be gay . it is not only harmful to the family environment , but also to society . and do not hand me that , " my uncle is gay . " stuff . i had ( he passed away ) a gay uncle , have three gay cousins , and a gay aunt . not my whole family is not gay , but it seems like i have quite a few in my family . now i do not support what they do . even though i love them because they are my family , i would not support them if they were to marry . and what evidence do you have that having two gay parents would confuse a child about weahter they should be gay ? did you know that the same percentage of children that were brought up by gay couples turn out to be gay as children who are brought up by straight couples ? i would say that destroys your conception that the kid would be confused . i know a number of people who were brought up by commited gay couples ( admittedly not many ) , and not one of the ones i know turned out to be gay .	0

government is violence . i am not aware that the police used violence in arresting any of the people discussed in this case . besides , i am not discussing personal morality here , i am discussing what should be legal , and what is practical in a society where not everyone shares the same moral views . government is there to apply limits to what is permitted , based on the will of the people .	0
legally there is a difference . but let us just toss that out for a second . the end result is exactly the same . eyes fogged over no longer care whether it was fun or self defense . well before there was a law someone came up with a difference , i did not ask if they end result was the same , i asked if there was a difference in the two . maybe a moral difference or something .	0
that ' s your problem . any other subjects on which you are delusional ? probably . <repeated> i think anyone who kills an unborn child with a knife to the head is a murderer . does that make me delsional ? and for the record , i think anyone that tries to take away a women ' s right to her own body is a sexist and has no respect for human life , or has any concious about the woman at stake here . you care merely about a couple of cells and not about the real humans , nor do you care about society . it seems to me you are only trying to earn yourself brownie points in heavan . i am not influenced by that , im going to have my own opinions , and speak about what i feel is right instead of some christian god telling me what to do .	0
i have to ask : have you actually read what you just quoted ? i know that must sound rude , but i can not for the life of me see the connection with the rest of the thread - or indeed any of the points you are trying to make . non - random ( or environmentally c and can you please tell me the difference between nonrandom variation and directed variation ? i ' d also like a link to verify what you say . thank you . god bless !	0
^^^ ^ . <repeated> not exactly , but close . also i said , ' god is sorta like time . <repeated> ' , but not exactly . god was here first . how can god be there before time ? you can not get before time , as the concept of before is irrelevant without time . even at the very beginnings of the universe time was not one of the curled up spatial dimensions .	0
following the logic of several people here , whatever god says is morally correct , therefore abortions are morally correct because god said so . let us see who ' s going to be consistent about their beliefs . this statement is not logical . it does not follow that if the person who creates the laws has to therefore follow them or can not change them . <repeated> or even that they apply to him . if a teacher says " no talking in the classroom " it does not apply to the teacher now does it .	0
my moral compass does not care if genesis is literally true or not . can anyone explain why it should ? well , if genesis was in fact true , then we would have to assume that god is real and the bible more or less explains what he wants , right ? and if there is someone " up there " who will damn you to eternal torment if you do not do what he wants ( which is one interpretation of the bible ) than that might effect the way you act . i realize that that is not exactly the same as changing your moral compass , but history has demonstrated that most people ' s moral will stretch to accomodate pressing needs , and i think an actual vengeful diety would qualify .	0
pointing out some of the achievements of science which could not have been accomplished in any other way , is not " raising science on a pedestal " - it ' s merely reciting the obvious . straw man . i am not attacking the achievements of science . i am attacking the notion that you have that scientists are exempt from the catalogue of influences that affect everyone else ; with only the slightest admission of a tiny possibility of cultural influence - which was quickly dismissed anyway with the false analogy of comparing evolution to aeronautical engineering .	0
this is so inane i dont know where to start . firstly - if there existed an armed forces capable of destroying the us military , then an armed civilian population would be absolutely no barrier to them . secondly - there is no single nation on earth that can move 200,000 , 000 men . thirdly - how exactly do you propose china get its men to the <allcaps> usa </allcaps> ? are they going to use their secrect commie teleporting machines ? there is no chance for them to cross the oceans , or deploy either north or south of the <allcaps> usa </allcaps> . yes that is a problem . but there is an instance when the 2 nd amendment did protect the <allcaps> usa </allcaps> from invaders : " someone at the table asked a japanese admiral why , with the pacific fleet devastated at pearl harbor and the mainland us forces in what japan had to know was a pathetic state of unreadiness , japan had not simply invaded the west coast " - <url> it wasn ' t for the 2 nd amendment you would be speaking japanese if you live on the west coast , german if you live on the east coast .	0
so far there is no mechanism for an organism to grow wings when it previously had none . i know this may seem obvious to most people , but it seems to have escaped the notice of creationists . birds are tetrapods , as are amphibians , reptiles , and mammals . birds did not just grow wings . wings are adaptions of the front limbs that were covered with feathers . perhaps you are unaware of the evidence that indicates that maniraptors had feathers , probably for thermoregulation . saying that there is no mechanism for birds to grow wings when they previously had none is like saying that there is no mechanism for mankind to grow arms when he previously had none . you see , mankind ' s closest relatives are the two species of chimpanzee - they are quadrupeds .	1
( 6 ) natural selection supposedly accounts for the development of new kinds , but actually tends to preserve the present kinds , since an incipient organ or new feature of any kind would have no " survival " value unless it were fully functional from its very beginning . actually , natural selection tends to preserve a species with only minor changes in a stable environment . but environments tend to change . i do not know what that " incipient organ " junk is supposed to mean . is that another way of saying " what good is half a wing . " well , check out a penguin to find out . look at a seal flipper . it has the same bones , arranged in the same way as a monkey . what good is it for a land animal ? and what does " fully functional " mean ? what function ? perhaps the new organ had a different purpose - take the clawed hands of fossil birds for example . they were good for catching prey and climbing , just like they were for their dinosaur ancestors . but those clawed wings also allowed early birds to fly .	0

so it ’ s the scientific community that sets up communication within a society , and then the dumb old common peasants come along and screw it all up ? hahaha – sorry but i ’ m not convinced . i ’ m not “ in ” science , other than unwillingly contributing my tax dollars – however small the percentage is – to a social agenda of those who control the scientific community . i ’ m permitted to have “ theories ” about it . emoticonxangel when the word “ theory ” is applied to a very wide range of subjects , it ’ s not fair to label someone who questions one theory a rejecter of all theories . that ’ s what the link in the opening post did – that ’ s not rational discourse , it ’ s not secular open inquiry , it ’ s not a search for truth or knowledge . it ’ s political / atheist rhetoric - look at the bottom of the page and whose name do we see ? richard dawkins , what a surprise . and a quick google of “ edgar pearlstein ” shows a sarah palin hating atheist liberal just like him . emoticonxrolleyes science has a role in the control of the people atheists do , but it doesn ’ t necessarily mean that they represent science . you haven ’ t gotten in over your head – most who post here don ’ t know much about science . tq doesn ’ t , and of course he ’ ll tell you that i don ’ t . there ’ s a big difference between science , and the creation / evolution controversy . many atheists who seem to be interested in science are actually only interested in it to the point that it helps them feel “ intellectually fulfilled ” , to discredit religion . some of the best reading on the creation / evolution controversy isn ’ t written by scientists , but by philosophers who have done just enough scientific homework on the subject to keep a clear focus on the controversy , without confusing it with too much detail . michael ruse and bradley monten are two excellent atheist authors on the subject . religious authors , practically too many to name . william dembski , david berlinski , phillip johnson , cornelius hunter , many others . you would do well to read anything by any of these people . far too many young people seem to make the mistake of getting most all of their information from rabid atheists who are also degreed biologists , like richard dawkins . he ’ s become a celebrity , and most degreed biologists who are not rabid atheists are a little to timid to take him on in a very direct way , without fear of discrimination , academic or otherwise . michael behe is one of the few who has been somewhat successful at it , not in avoiding discrimination , but in his ability to make a comfortable living in spite of it . read “ the edge of evolution ” , or “ darwin ’ s black box ” sometime . <happy> some irreducible complex structures , but not all of them . for atheists , that ’ s good enough . but it ’ s not good enough for everyone . in behe ’ s words ; “ … as biochemists have begun to examine apparently simple structures like cilia and flagella , they have discovered staggering complexity , with dozens or even hundreds of precisely tailored parts . … as the number of required parts increases , the difficulty of gradually putting the system together skyrockets , and the likelihood of indirect scenarios plummets . ” behe wrote this in 1996 , and since then it has only gotten worse for the atheists , no matter how much they dance . when it comes to all the examples that behe had provided in both his first book , and his second book , it has been shown to be able to evolve naturally . that means , in principle , ic systems can evolve . if you do not believe so , bring forth the i.c. system of your choice . to say ' but you do not know all the answers ' is just the logical fallacy known as ' argument from ignorance ' . behe brings a system up that he claims is ic . <repeated> the pathway for evolution is discovered , and behe trys another one . how dishonest can you get ? the concept is falsified .	0
if your personal identity causes you to believe that an attack on those ideas is an attack on you personally , than obviously what i have been saying about your personal commitent and emotional involvement with materialist / mechanist / darwinist / atheism is spot on the money . if i were to become upset merely because you told me the ideas were wrong , you might have a point . but i do not ; never have , so far as i recall . an idea can not be stupid , or simple - minded . an idea can be right or wrong , or perhaps partly both . when you describe an idea as stupid , you are saying it is wrong and one would have to be stupid to think that . when you describe an idea as simple minded you are saying it is wrong and one would have to be simple - minded to think that .	0
moose automatically assumes a bible website is always dishonest . shame on you for that bigotry . ez . that is not what i said . i would think a bible website would be good for biblical information , but for archaeological information ? not so much . if you want to provide archaeological evidence of the exodus , why do not you seek out information from an archaeology sources ? please answer this . if i wanted to seek archaeological evidence to confirm something that happened to a people that was written about in their ancient writings , i would not seek a specialist in the ancient writings as a resource , i would seek an archaeology expert . does not that make sense ?	1

and yet you continue to support the illogic of a potential person having the right to make a slave of a person in being . incredible . and , yes , if i am in a persistent vegetative state , i have authorized my family to direct my physicians to pull the plug . i am not there . what is not only illogical but patently false is the assertion that the unborn baby is making his mother a slave of any kind . did that baby force her to conceive it ? is that baby the equivalent of a tumor as the pro abortionists claim them to be ? no , it is an unborn human being who just needs the time to grow and develop in order to be a sentient being just as we are as we type on these keyboards . that explains everything about how irrational you are ! but based on your posts though , i think they already pulled the plug . emoticonxfrazzledemoticonxdonno	1

you do not leave a lot of room for disagreement moose . all one must do to get pounced on by you all as a group is to say we disagree with the lifestyle and we are immediately attacked as christianistas / christers / christianists bigots . homophobic haters who want to oppress and destroy you . but none of what you accuse me of being is true which is why it rolls of me like water off a duck . and i realize my truth is hard and painful to receive but it is spoken in love and out of an eternal concern for you . if what i believe is true , and it is ; and i really felt about gays as you say i do , then why would i tell you about the good news of salvation in the hope of spending eternity with you ? explain that if you can . your truth ? <repeated> your truth ? <repeated> does it come in singles or in a bundle ? do i get some sort of discount for being agnostic , that ' s halfway between theist and atheist , ja ? does it cost extra to buy the ' be judgmental and condescending , and you will enter heaven ' version , or can i just buy the ' i have so many flaws , but when they are exposed or i am out of hand , i will just fall back on jesus , and that makes me perfect and whole ' one ? nah , i will be satisfied with ' the truth that i know is truth , not faith . let us just skip the faith process .

well i was going from the guardian article which was rather more in depth on the specifics . the guardian in particular his ex - wife ' s ultimatum seems to reduce their 19 years of marriage to a sham ( for lack of a better phrase ) : making sweeping judgments against homosexuals and atheists , with no real knowledge of their situation ? archie has no problem . but when it comes to christianity , the obfuscational ploy of ' i do not know all the details ' comes out , followed promptly by a thorough lack of concern for finding out any additional details . she is blatantly violating her religion in doing so . the bible lays out exclusive reasons for ' divorce ' . this is not one of them . this is yet another example of religious intolerance , even to the extent of violating their own religion .	1

easyrider - - that site mentions an archaeologist named p . bagatti . i am not aware of an archaeologist by that name . i suspect the author may have meant to say ' b . bagatti , ' as in father ( or padre ) bellarmino bagatti ( professor , studium biblicum franciscanum at flagellation , jerusalem ) .

( if anything it says life starts at birth with the first breath ) like the above quote , why is the church trying to stop abortion when they would consider one to be alive after taking a breath . if you were to look at it from a scientific standpoint , the individual ovum and sperm are living cells , but they die all the time and no one cares . an embryo or fetus is something starting to develop into a human and that can not be stopped without killing it or injecting differnt <allcaps> dna </allcaps> , but it ' s still not too different from sperm and ovum . if you can not trust the church to make fair decisions and follow values and morals and rules they put in place , how can you expect an honest good decision about anything from it .	0

regardless , we have yet to see any evolution of new body parts or its so called " steps " if evolutionists want to suggest that a few decades is too little time why would that even be expected ? when you consider that it is important to maintain some sort of consistency in study populations , obvious mutants are excluded from the breeding stock . and yet , there are frequent observed mutations . in fact , my elder son once observed two mutations in a single fly in one of his populations . one fly had no wings and white eyes .	0
without question my largest beef with god would have to be the fact that according to the bible you need to believe in god in some fashion or another in order to make it into heaven . the reason this is my beef with him is because it is much more difficult to believe in him when you are born in india than if you are born in the us or europe . the indian culture is that of hinduism and a mix of other religions unlike that of the us and europe which is primarily christian . that means being born in the us or europe gives you a better chance of making it to heaven as you are more likely to end up being a christian and believing in god . would the be at all fair if this were the case ? my answer is plainly and simply no ! it is idiotic infact . if god existed and he was perfect then almost without a doubt he would have to base getting into heaven on the actions of a person instead of the beliefs of a person to be fair . his system would not be at all perfect if being born in one place means you get into heaven while being born in another place means you do not get into heaven . furthermore this means that he needs to take into consideration other influences on your life including whether or not your parents or community were proper places to grow up and whether or not you were ever given the proper situation in which to change your life to god ' s expectations . if not given any opportunities or given very few and still turning out to be a decent person should be better than if you turned out to be a decent person and were given many opportunities to end up this way . god in all his perfection would need a very complicated system to judge who gets into heaven in order for it to be fair but i just do not see spelled out in the bible . why would anyone want to get to heaven ? archangel and people like him would be there , praying and chanting 24 / 7 . thanks but no thanks !	1

how can family values shift in a nation withint 10 years ? <repeated> 10 years ago america would have never thought they wouldve needed to put marriage ammendments on the ballot let alone have less than 60% of the people actually vote for it . its sad to see a nation degrade exponentially fast and not to mention the people ' s consciences getting seared at the same time . its kinda like the germans after slow and steady progress of the nazi party changed the whole nation ' s perspective on the jews . people that were against the nazi party 5 years prior found themselves turning jews into concentration camps . i see a similar progression beginning in america to the point that this comment itself will be bashed by those on here whose conscience has been seared to the point that they think 2 men being married is ok . if everyone in the world was gay , the human race would become extinct . edit / delete message reply with quote so gay people , in your opinion , have no right to form the families of their choice ? so you are defending the continued oppression of gay people ? we are sick of conservative family types . we are tired of the closet . the phrase " we are mad as hell and we are not going to take it any more " applies . i see in your response the comming of the camps to lock and exterminate gay people . it is that type of thought , that jews were subhuman , that led to the final solution . as it is here with conservatives and religious right nuts , who believe gay people are sub human sickos in need of curing or killing .	0

apparently , these " underlying preferences " are of absolutely no effect , since the psychological conditioning of the individual overrides any other " built - in " trait factor . therefore these " built - in " trait factors are useless in practicality , because nothing about the individual ' s identity is influenced by them . so why should we even entertain the idea that they exist ? i guess i am just " psychologically conditioned " to be blue eyed ? . <repeated>	1
of course , we also need to note that the rise and fall of abortion rates are not necessarily linked to who is president at the time . clinton gave access to b / c which is known to prevent pregnancies . bush has reduced access to b / c ( including e / c ) . a primary reason for aborting is money - americans have been less well off under bush .	0

' white guilt is the biggest flaw in the american psyche ' , says dr . david yeagley , comanche indian source : comanche_patriot — — — — — — — — — — white pride and white guilt today in the united states and most of the white world , as soon as a white child begins his formal education , he is implicitly told that he should feel guilt for the crimes of his ancestors . guilt for finding , conquering , enslaving , and killing off non - whites around the globe . <repeated> and littering in the process . this guilt stems not from his own crimes , but from the supposed crimes of other ( dead ) people of the same race . but the child is never encouraged to take pride in the amazing achievements of his race . more : white pride and white guilt — — — — — — — — — — white guilt , obamamania , and the reality of race supporting obama for president , like supporting colin powell a decade ago , is seen by many whites as the ultimate in white guilt repellent . i do not recall ever meeting any white person who personally felt guilty for the troubles of african - americans . but i have known many whites who want to loudly blame other whites for black difficulties . more : vdare . com : 01/02/07 - white guilt , obamania , and the reality of race — — — — — — — — — — white guilt = black power white guilt is best understood as a vacuum of moral authority . whites live with this vacuum despite the fact that they may not feel a trace of personal guilt over past oppression of blacks . whites simply come to a place with blacks where they feel no authority to speak or judge and where they sense a great risk of being seen as racist . one terrible feature is that it means whites lack the authority to say what they see when looking at blacks and black problems . political correctness is what whites have the authority to say about blacks , no matter what they see . it is a language of severely limited authority , of euphemisms that steer whites around associations with racism . the muteness that white guilt imposes on whites undergirds black power . it lets blacks live inside the silence of whites , and have our weaknesses be unutterable by whites even as they are plainly visible . messrs . jackson and sharpton are enforcers of white silence . and when whites are silent , black mediocrity is no deterrent to black advancement . everywhere that minorities press institutions today as groups , there is an erosion of excellence . the reason for this is that white guilt allows institutions to respond only with deference – deferring to the greater moral authority of minorities by lowering standards , and remaining mute to minority mediocrity , to save the institution from the racist label . so whites have made it socially virtuous to defer and stand aside as institutions erode . the public schools are all but devastated , universities are stunted by ideology , corporations are more unctuous than churches , the media are more unctuous yet , and american politicians – of left and right – speak in barren clichés about all of this when they speak at all . more : white guilt = black power — — — — — — — — — — white guilt . <repeated> myth or reality ? shana attends a big 12 school and is always seeing white girls her age or younger propositioned by black men who get offended if rebuffed . she personally knows of one girl who had her entire social life ruined by a black man who called her a racist at a party because she would not be alone with him . ' he said something like , ' x <elongated> , you just will not be wit ' me ' cause i be black ' . ' a hush settled over the crowd and a bunch of people looked at her like she was a pariah . the girl ended up going back home when all of her dormmates started harassing her for being a ' bigot ' . white guilt is when a white person feels sorry for a person of color to such a point that they sacrifice their own rights , and often their own self - respect in a futile hope that somehow their action will atone for the real or imagined sins of their ancestors . arabs had slaves . as long as the slave was not muslim it was legal . arabs were even the organizers of the african slave trade to the west . yet there is no arab guilt over slavery . the romans had their entire economy powered by slaves . and often their own people were slaves . yet there is no italian or roman guilt . and the ultimate irony about the american slave trade was that many african tribes made raids on other tribes and then sold their human booty to western or arabic slavers , yet there is no african guilt . why white guilt then ? one of the reasons is the media . more : queen of succubi presents white guilt fact or myth ? — — — — — — — — — — white guilt : today , tomorrow , and forever just recently , after declining a funding request from one of chicago ’ s numerous beggars , i heard a most peculiar thing . the man yelled at me as i walked away : “ i ’ m sorry i ’ m not white . ” at first i assumed he was talking to someone else ; then i saw that he wasn ’ t . his tactic must have been an attempt to shame pedestrians into giving him more change . presumably , as the man did not look like a novice to this ancient profession , it must be a strategy that , with the exception of this occasion , works , which tells us quite a bit about the psyche of caucasian americans . more : american renaissance news : white guilt : today , tomorrow , and forever — — — — — — — — — — the myths behind white guilt - part 1 . the slave trade one of the many weapons which our opponents use against us , and also against others of european ancestry , is often termed historical white guilt . those who hate us point accusingly to our empire , and to our involvement in the transatlantic slave trade with the implication that we , particularly the british and european americans , are uniquely guilty of crimes against other races . they believe that , by making us feel guilty about our past , we will be less inclined to object to what is done to us on behalf of our alleged ' victims ' . more : the myths behind white guilt - part 1 . the slave trade | national policy institute here is an accurate depiction of white guilt at work every day in north america and europe . . oh blah ! blah ! blah ! what the devil do comanches know ? the sisterhood and brotherhood of sioux , navajo , iroquois and other sundry tribes .	1

my point wasn ' t to show that the unborn is a person but to show that the real question is not " who gets to determine the future of a woman ' s pregnancy , the woman herself or some nameless faceless bureaucrat ? " but whether or not the unborn is a person . i think there are two separate questions here . ( 1 ) when does personhood begin ? ( 2 ) who gets to make such arbitrary , moral decisions on behalf of a pregnant woman ? both are legitimate issues of contention . you can not just dismiss the one you do not want to argue as unimportant . there are lots of excellent arguments going every which way , and many of them are objectively unresolvable , such as the one pertaining to the onset of personhood . they are truly matters of opinion . so , since there is obviously little agreement between people about when an egg and sperm become a person with full human rights , the practical question really is whose opinion matters most ? the woman ' s , or the faceless bureaucrat ' s ? emoticonxgood	0

i personally think that abortion is wrong . i think that a fetus is still a baby . i do think that abortion can be okay but only if the mother ' s life is in danger , otherwise they should live with it . they should have stayed away from the causes of pregnancy . preganancy should not be used as a punitive measure against women who are sexual . what you think is not reflective of the reality of women and their cicumstances that exist in the world . the reasons to abort are numerous and complicated . some reasons are more valid than others . but you have no way of knowing that for millions of women , only they can really know . and although there are some youngsters in this forum who negate life experience , it is not to be negated . ther is a lot to be said for " walking in a mile in another ' s shoes " . be careful about your desire to take the life circumstances of a stranger in your hands . are you ready to be morally cuplable for the damage you could do ?	0

i have been in several 3 rd world countries , and i have never once seen a case where someone would be killed if they did not convert to christianity , or even if they did convert from christianity to islam . on the other hand , i have seen a number of cases where muslim family members who converted to christianity had to flee their family out of fear of death . i would be very interested in reading about or hearing about cases where the reverse is true , but i do not think there are many such cases out there . the issue of witchcraft among christian churches may be an exception at least to the degree of people and children being ostracized . the pastors are claiming themselves as a " spiritual shield " against witchcraft . of course you do not need such a shield until you find a witch , guess what happens next .	1
i just wonder why the polls showed such support for bush at first , but after the liberal press got their claws in him and began tearing away , suddenly the support waivered . are you gonna tell me that this change in support comes from logical thought ? c ' mon , i give you a little more credit than that . most americans interpret ? geez <elongated> , most americans do not know their a * * from a hole in the ground , they just listen to the sound bytes that are dished out by the liberal press so their support of bush ( so you say ) means exactly what ? that they were listening to the sound bytes dished out by bush ' s rhetoric ? and where is bush is the man and jim ' s trucking ? usually they are all over it when someone says something bad about the american people . oh , that ' s right . <repeated> it ' s ok when a person on the right says it , it ' s when it said by a liberal like moore that it becomes an issue .	0

why should they kill a human being in the womb , whether this human being is arab or not ? are not the arab and non - arab created by god ? why all this discrimination among the creation of god ? eanassir i think that you missed the point of the argument . vt is arguing that the low birth rate in the west is attributable to high abortion rates and the high birth rates amongst arabs creates a numbers game in favor of the arabs . since they respect life ( their own , that is ) more than the west , their numbers are growing much quicker , while our lack of respect for human life is causing the gap to widen .	0

i find it interesting that the stars create the clouds and inturn the clouds form into stars . one vicious cycle with no begining . in a forum devoted to origin you offer the explainiation of no origin at all but rather meaningless existence . this is the main problem i have with evolution and it ' s application to physical sciences . a cycle with no begining has indeed no forseeable end . therefore on a personal level i have no hope of changing anything . things were , are and will continue to be this cycle of events . as this applies to biology any other life sciences . my actions are only the result of my animal instict . i am not playing the inner - child but rather the inner - beast . no law is passed to keep a beast in submission to another beast . governing bodies fail if there is no accountablity . that is the cruix of the discussion . i am accoutable to god . if i am wrong about creation , i have only missed out on a lifetime of animal behavior . if you are wrong about evolution , then i fear you are far the worse off then i . ok , now i ' d like to know why lappster thinks evolution has anything to do with morality ? do you actually know what evolution is lappster ?	0

you liked to david icke - the guy who beleives that giant lizards are secretly running the world today . <repeated> you need to take this with a pinch of salt . anyway , i honestly do not really see a problem with salvaging things from the dead that are going to benefit the rest of mankind . it sounds icky , and is to a degree but seems better than feeding them to maggots or just burning them . fair enough if you want have it as an option like organ donors but seems the same thing really to me , especially as there are babies that die because they need immediate organ or tissue donors after being born . its the allegations of babies being killed to fund this i doubt , seems to be an attempt to sensationalise a piece of news . i stand by the original point that there is not really a medical use for fetus skin as was claimed , some of the organs might be of more use but thats about it . it may only be salvaging to you but to the parents involved it is body theft . let me just ask you to step in our shoes for just 10 minutes imagine trawling around 100 ' s of hospital labs and medical schools seeing all these poor little babies lined up in jars and i do not mean just a few there is up to 50 in each hospital and school imagine looking at those jars hoping that one of them is your child so you can at lastgive him the burial he / she deserves ( a basic human right ) yet at the same time praying that none of them are yours . having done that can you still say that it is only salvage bearing in mind our children were only sent for post mortem and many of us have not seen them since ?	0

guidance by humans in the blind watchmaker does not stop it being a reasonable analogy for his idea that no higher intelligence is in evolution but it can produce . in the analogy the guidance by humans represents natural selection . you could represent the rules of natural selection as set of equations with random elements that contained no human ingenuity instead but i do not see it as a crime to use a human forced to act under restrictions to represent that has nothing to do with humans . i will show youyou could describe electrons as things that hate other electrons but like positive charges . if some electrons see other electrons coming at them down a wire they will also move down the wire to avoid them . if it means going through a circuit an powering a light globe to do the electrons will still flow if the circuit is complete . now lets think about whats happening , each indivual electron hates large group of electrons coming towards it but to get out of the way it will have to get closer to other electrons ( those punks ) . so if you increased the cross sectional area of the wire then the resistance will decrease . what about a double adaptor ? all it does is let the current go through two different circuits . now if there are two light globes will they both glow half as bright ? no . why because the resistance is halved and there will be twice as much total electron flow . a lot of laws in electric circuit theory made sense to me when i imagined i was an electron going through a wire and how happy i would be going down a wire . electrons are not happy but i still had an analogy that gave me answers so i was happy . i would have been better off being told that voltage is joules per coloumb so the voltage drop between circuits must be the same . again , it ' s not the point . there are many who do not deny evolution , they believe it was guided . showing examples of guidence - through artificial selection supports this theory	0

so , you think there is a god ? bad design does not equate to no design . it really is a poor argument . much of the force of darwin ' s arguments deal with bad design . i invite anyone to post any of darwin ' s arguments that specifically outline his case against design because of " bad " design . that said , consider this , your car is said to operate at 25% fuel efficiency . one could claim then the car is 75% bad design , therefore it is not designed , and if it is , certainly not by anyone of any intelligence . your audio cd ' s have reed - solomon error correction because the read / write process is full of errors that need correcting . cleary this is " bad design " that engineers would create read / write heads that make so many errors in the first place . same with modems and host of other devices . clearly if in the remote chance these bad designs are evidence of design , the designers must be clueless ! poorly designed dramas have villains and heroes . clearly a drama ( even a divine drama ) is poorly designed if it has villains in the story . all the characters should be pollyanna and there should be no great tragedies on the road to a happy ending . life and the divine drama , like cd ' s and cars , are clearly not designed , or at least not designed by anyone with intelligence , because of all the bad design woven into the designs . the reason audio cd ' s have so many read / write errors which are corrected reed - solomon error correction ( somewhat like us reading someone ' s writing and mentally correcting spelling and grammar errors ) is that it is the most optimal way to get as much data on a cd as possible . the tightest packing of data implies the highest amount of errors based on the shannon capacity theorem . the mp3 ' s and <allcaps> jpegs </allcaps> are even more " error " prone in that they are inexact representations of the original sound or picture , but the goal was not fidelity but compactness . a similar consideration is for the 75% inefficiency for cars . the goal is for higher acceleration and agility and cost , etc . , not fuel efficiency . the point is " bad " design , in the grand scheme of things , might not be bad design after all . the high rate of sickness and death , the eventual death of the universe as predicted by the 2 nd law of thermodynamics are not evidences that the designer is unwise , any more than the many errors in the read / write process of audio cd suggests the engineers of those devices are incompetent . origin of species chapter 13 : there is another and equally curious branch of the present subject ; namely , the comparison not of the same part in different members of a class , but of the different parts or organs in the same individual . most physiologists believe that the bones of the skull are homologous with that is correspond in number and in relative connexion with the elemental parts of a certain number of vertebrae . the anterior and posterior limbs in each member of the vertebrate and articulate classes are plainly homologous . we see the same law in comparing the wonderfully complex jaws and legs in crustaceans . it is familiar to almost every one , that in a flower the relative position of the sepals , petals , stamens , and pistils , as well as their intimate structure , are intelligible in the view that they consist of metamorphosed leaves , arranged in a spire . in monstrous plants , we often get direct evidence of the possibility of one organ being transformed into another ; and we can actually see in embryonic crustaceans and in many other animals , and in flowers , that organs which when mature become extremely different , are at an early stage of growth exactly alike . how inexplicable are these facts on the ordinary view of creation ! why should the brain be enclosed in a box composed of such numerous and such extraordinarily shaped pieces of bone ? as owen has remarked , the benefit derived from the yielding of the separate pieces in the act of parturition of mammals , will by no means explain the same construction in the skulls of birds . why should similar bones have been created in the formation of the wing and leg of a bat , used as they are for such totally different purposes ? why should one crustacean , which has an extremely complex mouth formed of many parts , consequently always have fewer legs ; or conversely , those with many legs have simpler mouths ? why should the sepals , petals , stamens , and pistils in any individual flower , though fitted for such widely different purposes , be all constructed on the same pattern ? on the theory of natural selection , we can satisfactorily answer these questions . homology was a pre - darwinian idea with the term coined by owen who rather despised darwin and his ideas . darwin tries to argue why a designer would not use the same for the same function . he says homology is evidence of an unwise design . the premise is a creator would not be so inefficient . but , unless one has a handle on the teleological goal , one is free to fabricate all manner of " bad design " arguments ( for example read / write errors in audio cd ' s or fuel inefficient cars ) . the biotic message theory suggest the teleological goal for biotic reality is to communicate to humans that there is one designer and author of life , and that life could not have evolved . like a great novel , the " imperfections " of biology are part of a larger plot . it is turning out , darwin ' s argument from homology is a concept in crisis . you are assuming that the <allcaps> toe </allcaps> of evolution has remained static since darwins time . i have to say that is false . we have 150 years of experimental data beyond that . in addition , we not only have the arguement from homology , but we have genetic data to back it up . so sorry , but you struck out .	0
how can what did not erode for 100 million years to expose a full dino print , now be eroding only within the last 40 ? because the location of the tracks used to be a tidal plane . in other words , it used to be at the edge of the ocean . around that time the sea coast advanced and receded several times . the tracks were buried . the tracks actually had to be uncovered . the tracks were originally discovered immdiately after an unusually severe storm in the area in which an unusual amount of water came down the paluxy . that unusual flow of water washed away the soil that covered some of the tracks . other tracks have been intentionally uncovered . for example , in one case , where a trackway went under a bank , several feet of the bank was removed to expose more tracks .	0

you say that homosexual relationships should be all that there should be because hetero sex is wrong . using your logic there would be no more children because nobody would be straight . after everyone died humans would no longer exist because there would be no offspring . very intelligent i must say . great way to preserve the human race . emoticonxbanghead this is how i feel everytime i hear a dumb statement like that . ever hear of artificial ensemination ? why is that heteros only think there is one way to produce children ? i find hetero sex disturbing , and an unnatural lifestyle choice .	1
i was just following your logic to its ultimate logical conclusion . liberals do not give a damn about individual freedom ; they want governmental control over all aspects of your life . they want gov ' t control of healthcare because they think we are too dumb to fend for ourselves . they want to indoctrinate our kids in school because they do not trust parents to be parents . the list of liberal intrusisms into our lives is endless . that is just conservative bias . conservatives are just as guilty of the same things as liberals and then each has their own ideological idiocy that is unique to each group . conservatives like classes and do not like change . a pure conservative society would fail just as quickly as a pure liberal one . the last 10 - 20 years as we have become more us vs . them the overall prosperity and well being of the country has declined . with both sides taking the country to extremes . conservatives eased restrictions and corporations run wild . those laws are in place for a reason . liberals overreact and put a choke hold on growth . there was a reason for less restrictive laws , but now they can not do anything meaningful .	0

ah <elongated> , thats where youre mistaken . <allcaps> any </allcaps> aspect of science that can be discredited helps strengthen the creationist stance . not really . that ' s the fallacy of exclusion of the middle . because there are only two choices , if one is wrong somehow , the other is therefore correct . the problem is that there is not only two choice for sure . besides , science is wrong all the time , it does not prove that creation is right . in fact , for instance , science estaimtes of moon dust have been proven wildly wrong , and those corrections actually harm creation .	0

science will never be able to disprove any god because of some flaw science happens to point out . the best individuals can do is , when people try to reason that such perfect organs imply a designer , point out that the design is not all that perfect after all . exactly . trying to prove that god , if he exists , did not make us as good as an all powerful being should have made us does not prove anything in the god debate . i could always debate that since god is all powerful and all knowing he could have always thought of something better to do . if he made those changes , then of course there would still be something better he could have thought of . this would be an endless loop of creating something better and better until finally he would have to stop and say that is good enough . but even then this debate that he did not make us as good as he could have would be valid in my view .	0

but why does this generation get to bypass the same authority that every other generation before them submitted to with their parental oversight ? how is it right now for 13,14 and 15 year old kids to make such adult decisions without their parents knowing ? are you suggesting that 13 year old girls are mature enough emotionally to make such adult decisions about getting an abortion ? and if so , do you then also believe that a 13 - 15 year olds should be allowed to adopt a child ? or to enter into a contract to purchase a home or car ? because those are also adult decisions and it does not seem reasonable to me that we should allow them to slide on emotionally damaging decisions about sex or abortions and then insist they are not mature enough to participate in other adult decisions . kids need consistency in order to grow up to be responsible adults and by your way of thinking , you will just add more confusion and insecurity in an already difficult time in an adolescents life . yes , because its <allcaps> their </allcaps> decision , its <allcaps> their </allcaps> stomachs , and its <allcaps> their </allcaps> lives . i agree that some decisions do need to be made with parental consent , but not this one . irrelevant . how does purchasing a house have to do with abortion ? ok , so what if the kid wants to have the baby and the adults want to get rid of it ? what if the adults want her to have the baby and the kid wants to get rid of it ? you would force the kid to have a child ( that does not seem responsible at all ) , or you would force the kid to abort her child ( thereby taking away her son or daughter ) . both of those decisions do not sound very consitent or responsible . the decision is best left up to the person that is pregnant , regardless of their age .	0

that is an erroneous line of reasoning because it fails to take into account the myriad of other options open to a women after birth to remove the newborn from her care without any ill effects ( physically anyway ) . killing in the instance of a newborn is not justified because of those other options open to her . sigma i have taken into account the options a woman has after pregnancy . however , there are no doubt cases in the history of the world ( not just within america ) where there were no options available to a mother but to keep her child ( ie : the first human woman to give birth in the history of the world ) . for this pro - choice line of reasoning to be absoulutely true it must be true in every possible situation . are you saying that the killing would be justified if no other options were available to her ?	0

current us policy is moving towards a 27.5% tariff on all chinese products . with the exception of a few , inefficient but politically protected industries , the us produces few of the consumer goods we now import from china . what we do manufacture is so out of line with labor / compliance costs to be totally uncompetitive even if the chinese doubled their prices . does anyone think the us public , with stagnated wages , understands that move will be a substantial direct increase in their cost of living ? is the administration counting on blind patriotism for public approval of again having their wallets lifted ? or , does anyone else see this as a move to increase consumer spending in an effort to keep expanding the internal transaction driven gdp ? as in the net difference from wholesale to retail price , our usual crisis management style in lieu of long - range planning . <url> i am surprised that some people still are not aware of what the chinese have done to upgrade their country . sure , certain areas like the financial sector are still lagging ( which is why they will not float the yuan just yet ) , but when it comes to industry and infrastructure they are done a most admirable job . does anybody here also think it ' s kinda funny that a communist country is beating the us at their own game ( i . e . capitalism ) ?	0

so , archie , nothing matters if it is outside of america ? sure they matter . but that is not the issue here . you posted this in the abortion forums as if this medical malpractice which is taking place in an impoverished third world country is justification for it in america . that is a ludicrous and totally bogus argument to make . if you thought rationally , you would have it in the health forum and be complaining about how third world countries are so ill prepared for this common problem when we have the technology so readily available to avoid it . my lord simone , a simple c - section is all that is required to make this a non issue for mother and baby . but you ignorantly post this drivel as if abortion is the solution . it makes no sense at all , and yet you post it thinking that you are contributing something rational . go figure , huh ! <repeated> emoticonxfrazzled	0

right now , i might consider it , as i am now a few weeks away from my graduation . back then , i would not , as i had just begun college ( i was in my sophomore year for my bs - now i am about to get my ms ) . however , there is also that other major part of my decision - i never had the intention to become pregnant , and we even took steps to make sure i would not . that also is a major factor in any of my decisions on it . another decision that involves my work is that from about my fifth month on ( acording to the doctors i spoke with ) - i would be unable to work - that ' s four months , and while right now i am in good standing with my company and they might even allow me to do that , back then i was just starting out , and would be unable to do so . so , i ' d say that at the moment if that were to happen , and that i was paid a stipend ( i know of no place near me that does so ) and then gave the baby up for adoption , my fiance and i would seriously consider the prospect . i know that in the future - in five years or so - we expect to be able to have paid off all our loans , and we will then consider actually having a baby . so in summary - now i would consider it , but back when i had the actual abortion ( 6 years ago or so ) i would not consider it . that sounds like an honest answer . how did you feel about it at the time ? how do you feel about it now ? just trying to educate myself more . huck	0

if someone says the big bang people have to say the big bang and not the " evolution of the universe " because it will just waste time . now you are being ridiculous . the big bang is not the evolution of the universe . the words " evolution of the universe " do not necessarily entail the big bang . for example , brane theory offers an alternative theory to explain the evolution of the universe . but claiming that the " evolution of the universe " is part of the theory of evolution is somewhat like claiming that because kate hudson has achieved stardom , she is producing vast amounts of energy through hydrogen fusion . why is it that creationists believe that every word has only a single meaning ? by the way , i have always heard the creationist invention " <allcaps> gte </allcaps> " referred to as the general theory of evolution - you know , as if there is some relation to the general theory of relativity .	0
this is not interesting at all . what did these magical " light - sensitive cells " evolve from ? what were they before and what event or process caused them to evolve into light sensing cells ? why do bats continue to rely on sonar to " see ?

the bible falls completely silent on the issue of abortion . all direct condemnations on abortion found in the new testament were quickly discarded as irrelevant by theologians . christianity had it ' s chance at condemning abortion in the bible and choose not to ! for hundreds of years the vatican supported abortion rights . even it ' s most celebrated saints were not only outspoken supporters but blazed a path for theology to support it . and in early america , it wasn ' t rare for abortion services to be posted on church bulletinboards . again , these are facts that the pro - life / christian - con movement you never find out about . they would rather have you believe in lies instead for their political agendas . that was a nice rant that had absolutely nothing to do with anything . the essential question is not what various religous leaders have said about the issue , but what the bible says about the issue .	0

oh , and btw , cooperative mechanisms of evolution are perfectly compatible with darwinian mechanisms . it ' s still a matter of determining which genomes survive into the next generation , and if genes that have ' learned ' how to cooperate are better survivors than those that compete too aggressively , then darwinian theory predicts they should increase their frequency in the population . biologists have used game theory extensively to model how balances between cooperation and competition can be maintained in a genetic population . but what we get from this sort of perspective is not a refutation of darwinian thinking , but a more complete perspective . so why have darwinists ignored symbiosis for decades if it was so compatible ? same with developmental biology ? why have developmental biologists been locked away in closets , never to be heard from until recently when they have forced themselves upon the scientific community ? the reality is you have no choice : accept that organisms cooperate with each other and respond purposefully and intelligently to the environment or else . tell me though : do you now admit that individuals evolve , not populations ?	1

within the community of christian believers there are areas of dispute and disagreement , including the proper way to interpret holy scripture . while virtually all christians take the bible seriously and hold it to be authoritative in matters of faith and practice , the overwhelming majority do not read the bible literally , as they would a science textbook . many of the beloved stories found in the bible – the creation , adam and eve , noah and the ark – convey timeless truths about god , human beings , and the proper relationship between creator and creation expressed in the only form capable of transmitting these truths from generation to generation . religious truth is of a different order from scientific truth . its purpose is not to convey scientific information but to transform hearts . we the undersigned , christian clergy from many different traditions , believe that the timeless truths of the bible and the discoveries of modern science may comfortably coexist . we believe that the theory of evolution is a foundational scientific truth , one that has stood up to rigorous scrutiny and upon which much of human knowledge and achievement rests . to reject this truth or to treat it as “ one theory among others ” is to deliberately embrace scientific ignorance and transmit such ignorance to our children . we believe that among god ' s good gifts are human minds capable of critical thought and that the failure to fully employ this gift is a rejection of the will of our creator . to argue that god ' s loving plan of salvation for humanity precludes the full employment of the god - given faculty of reason is to attempt to limit god , an act of hubris . we urge school board members to preserve the integrity of the science curriculum by affirming the teaching of the theory of evolution as a core component of human knowledge . we ask that science remain science and that religion remain religion , two very different , but complementary , forms of truth . over 10,000 signatures of christian clergy have been collected , and have endorsed this letter .	0
families that embrace id / creationism are increasingly deciding that their children have no place in the " classroom " . something like 58% of homeschoolers are doing it specifically to spare their children science ( evolution ) education owing to their religious convictions . we are already well behind most other industrialized countries with respect to science and math graduates . this scares me a bit . emoticonxfrazzled hey , someone has to clean our toilets . this may sound brutal , but one of the biggest reasons why indians , asians , etc all are heavy on education is because their lives sucked . they did not get a education and they were living in poverty . thus , they seem education , mainly the sciences and the maths as a way to escape poverty . japanese and chinese parents are massively strict on their kids because they want their kids of excel as the parents either were poor or grew up poor and know what that ' s like . this may be necessary for these religious homeschooled folks to find out . spending a life time in poverty or working 3 jobs to make ends meet will change someone ' s view point on education .	1

' - thomas jefferson so if jefferson could be wrong about that then he could be wrong about this too . furthermore , as i already pointed out , other founding fathers opposed him on the matter . race is the elephant in the room of american politics . segregation is not official , but who can deny that de facto segregation does not exist in the usa ? blacks stick to blacks and whites to whites . do you see any blacks in the tea party meetings ? how many blacks voted for jon mccain in the last presidential elections ?	0

pro choice is pro child is pro family . having access to contraception and to abortion if contraception fails or for other reasons strengthens the family . pro - choice is only pro child if the choice is not abortion and they are only pro family when the choice for family . so really pro choice can be pro child or anti child and pro family or anti family .	0

well , it seems that even the simplest of messages failed to penetrate some thick ( sick ) skulls : without guns you can not shoot and kill anybody . civilized remove all guns from circulation and do their utmost to also make gus unavailable to criminals and it works . only insecure , paranoid people with and inferiority complex need guns as a security blanket . grow up ! yeah , like the guy running from classroom to classroom killing at will . you think banning guns will prevent criminals from getting them ? i was going to say that you live in your own little world , but then i realized the sad reality was that you are in this world stealing my oxygen . what ? either try that again , or find someone who can translate . i kinda thought that the insecure , paranoid people were the ones who were afraid to step up and take responsibility for their own safety and security . i do not need to carry a gun , i could just roll over and die like so many others when faced with an assailant intent on killing me . i choose however to take responsibility for my safety and security , and as such , want to carry a gun . there is a difference .	1
so what . congress can pass any law it wants . does not mean it will stand up in court . the first portion , " a well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state , " is a qualifier to what follows " the right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed . " it seems pretty clear to me . but i am not one of the justices . this decision has been made , although i do not like it or agree with it . i do not see where today ' s hobbyist meets the intent - most especially in the well - regulated part . but there comes a point where what the dead guys thought just does not matter that much . it is 200 + years later . they left us with the ability to adjust with time and we have done that . they recognized their own shortcomings which might have the the wisest thing they did . the current interpretation is clear . we look at the last portion of the statement only . i do not think that , as i said before , a little common sense , is going to alter the interpretation in any meaningful way . after all , i could easily argue ( if i was totally stupid ) that my front yard is the perfect place for a working cannon . we both know that is not going to fly . just where does the armament argument end . with a cannon ? or with a nuc . let us face it . they said arms and they meant arms . not guns . they ' d probably let me have the cannon . the founding fathers never envisioned the kind of weapons we ' d have available today or what they ' d be used for . that ' s why their thoughts are purposely criptic and open ended . since we will always draw the line someplace , why not draw it at a good compromise between you and me . you asked where the line should be drawn in regards to weapons ? how about where ownership and use of weapons does not violate the rights of others . before you respons think about it . do anything you want . if i do not violate anyone then what is the beef ? if i do not break any laws or endanger anyone what is the beef ? the safe storage and handling of cannon , cannon propellant , and cannon ammo is well known . they can be stored in places typical of homes without violating the rights of others . <allcaps> btw </allcaps> a cannon is not a weapon . it is considered a ' firework ' by the <allcaps> atf </allcaps> . ever see a civil war renactment ? lots of cannons ? so yes having a cannon in your front yard does fly .	0

um , in the debate description it talks about how marx predicted that laissez faire capitalism would lead to an the nation being ruled by an elite few , which would cause the working majority to revolt . i merely showed how socialism with private property is fascism and capitalism with regulations is fascism . am i saying it ' s bad ? no , that ' s for you decide . if you like fascism , good for you . alright , i think i see your point know . however , i think the only way in which conservatives would be socialist is that they are soo capitalist they end up effectively swinging back to the other end of the spectrum by making people want to kill them . which is a silly argument because the proletariat ain ' t never rose up and not settled for simple tax breaks or what have you . furthermore , i am intrigued by your fascism point , i am just wondering how it affects the debate . are you saying that essentially all political ideals can effectively be reduced to the same ideology at their basest level ?	0

woopiee . <repeated> i would have to say that you are putting yourself deeper and deeper into the ccoi every post you are making . you see , this is talking about ' biblical creation ' . <repeated> you know , taking genesis literally , and all that type of nonsense . there are many deeply religious christians that have no problem in accepting that genesis is a story , and not historically accurate . it takes someone profoundly stupid and ignorant to pull that stuff out of their rear . and like i said , ' undisputable ' is totally stupid . <repeated> because even if the evidence is 100 percent positive , you have x <elongated> that will dispute it . i mean , this link has undisputable evidence of horse evolution , yet you will dispute it anyway horse evolution over 55 million years we are not talking about genesis as a story are we ? we are talking about bilbical creation . you really are thick arent you ? i know there are religious people , deeply and otherwise who accept the story of genesis as a story but that has no relevance to the thread . undisputable is only stupid because you cant provide it . certainly not as comprehensively as the aristotlian view of the universe was disproved . the horse evolution thread was fine . <repeated> you have showed a little horse turning into a big horse and not one species actually evolving into another distinct species but i will give you the benefit of the doubt . now show exactly how life originated and you are home and dry .	0

now look here , boy , i am tired of you spreading this ignorant bull * * * * . i came from the uk , i lived there most of my life , i saw the truth that you choose to ignore because it ' s inconvenient for you . the police have been caught intentionally miscounting the number of crimes reported by the people , they have been doing it for years . the people of the uk also do not report every instance of when they have been victimized . these two facts mean that any evidence you use to support your flawed position is untrustworthy and doctored to reflect whatever you want it to . you might as well be citing yourself ! even one of the biggest advocates of the post - dunblane handgun ban admitted that the ban was a huge failure , because even school children were able to get access to guns and kill their classmates . do not you ever spread this lie again , we know that there ' s no ounce of truth to it ! and that ' s coming from a former subject of the uk , somebody who saw it first hand ! so you are actually claiming that it is a lie to say that the uk has a lower gun crime rate than the us ? even if the police were miscounting crimes it ' s still a huge and unjustified leap in logic to conclude from that that the uk does not have a lower gun crime rate .	0

a mother who killed herself and her disabled daughter had been terrorised by a gang of youths and had her repeated pleas for help ignored by police , an inquest was told yesterday . … the single mother , her daughter and teenage son , anthony , had endured ten years of being virtual prisoners in their own home as a gang of up to 16 “ street kids ” tormented them for simply “ existing ” despite mrs pilkington and her family repeatedly calling the police and reporting that they had received death threats , she was told to close her curtains and ignore the children , a jury was told . a leicestershire police log shows that she called them more than twenty times in seven years to say that her severely dyslexic son ' s life had been threatened , her daughter , who had acute special needs , was being bullied and her house was under attack from the gang of youths . i know a bit about this myself . however the difference is that i was allowed to carry a gun under the reasonable man statute . an armed person truly cannot be bullied ! the old saying is . god created man and samuel colt made them equal ! old , disabled , female and all , are on an equal footing with these vicious predators !	0

i wasn ' t oversimplifying anything , only stating the obvious in that a whack job intent on murdering people can do it very effectively without a gun . but by disarming honest people as you would do , you insure that criminals who have no respect for the law will remain the only people armed in our society once the law abiding people willingly give theirs up . that will be a time to truly worry about our personal safety since we all know the police only respond to crimes committed but can not prevent crime from occurring as it ' s happening since most violent crimes take place in private settings . you anti - second amendment mooks simplify the issue by thinking that disarming good people who own weapons will somehow change the nature of all men . if you look at the rates of violent crimes in nations with stricter gun laws you will see that on a per capita basis violent crimes are just as high as they are here . it ' s just that more people die from stabbings and beatings than do here . but when all is said and done , dead is dead is dead . emoticonxbanghead i am not arguing that gun control will change the nature of men - though guns may make them more willing and confident to engage in crime . with guns criminals can do even more damage . adding guns to crime is like adding gasoline to a fire - it makes an already existing problem worse . if you think that just as many people die from stabbing and beatings in other developed nations as people die from guns in the us then you need to do more research .	0

i am curious as to why you specifically exclude self defense as a valid reason for owning a gun . data from the <allcaps> fbi </allcaps> shows that victims who resist an aggressor by use of a gun are less likely to be injured than when they use other weapons for defense . i would think that this alone would validate the ownership of a gun for defensive use . on a related note , as was recently confirmed by the <allcaps> scotus </allcaps> , owning a firearm is an individual right . i am not aware of any other right that you are required to to demonstrate a reason prior to exercising . because self - defence , unlike most other ' reasons ' , automatically allows all citizens firearm access , and in most cases allows firearm acess without mandatory training / evaluation . when this occurs , you are much more likely to get misuse of firearms . if you read around you will see that i consider all rights as needing justification . this comes both from my stance as a relativist and as a uk citizen , where there is no formalised constitution . ask yourself this - if a right cannot be justified , why should it be treated as a ' right ' ?	0

actually the apocrypha is made up of pre - christian texts , and late 4 th century is a bit of a stretch for the new testament , certainly all its component texts were widely accepted by the 2 nd century . i do not whether it is " generally accepted " that the text was altered , it seems to me that you are projecting your own views based on the hypotheses of some scholars on to biblical scholarship in general . while the current cannon was ' accepted ' by the late second century , there were numerous other ' gospels ' that existed by then , and were eliminated at the 4 th century time frame . most of those copies were destroyed , but some have been unearthed .	0
then there is little chance of consensus because other groups or religions come up with other arbitrary set of rules and we are back to the situation of , in the worst case , chaos and , in the best case , a majority imposing arbitrary rules on an unwilling suffering minority . but pro - lifers often base the pro - life stance on preventing harm . not just religion . ( and in this case they are one - in - the - same anyway . ) this is not a case of harm - preventative - morality versus religious - morality ; it ' s a case of two harm - preventative moralities in conflict , due to each only focusing mostly on one aspect ( either the mother or the unborn baby ) .	0

waiting until they are born likely gives them no more chance of surviving than killing them in the womb . what chance does an unexpecting child have against a grown person intent on killing him ? i think they have more of a chance becasue , while many manage to delude themselves into believing that an unborn child is not a baby , it would be much more difficult to convince yourself that a crying baby is not a baby . even in the animal kingdom ( which we are all part of ) you see some animals hesitate to kill the young of their own species . evne coyotes will not generally kill a pup ( i have even seen a pack of coyoptes pass a domestic pup without killing it , though they could have . i am told this is because of the stubby nose , which shows the coyotes that it is , indeed , a puppy , even though it looks unfamiliar to them ) .	0

it is not the existence of the gay people that moralizing families question . their opposition to them being in the video is not based on that . their view is that it should not be considered a ' family ' in the acceptable sense of the term . not that they exist . surely you know this . now , you and i do not agree with that , but the question here is whether or not the school should teach about issues that moralistic ones in peoples ' minds , such as this one . imo , they should not . there is a broader issue here . so you think censoring over the issue being a moralistic one is ridicuous , eh ? so you ' d have no problem with schools teaching that people should go to church ? or that male kids can have more than one wife at a time when they grow up ? those too are moralistic - based issues to many people . so basically , what you are advocating here is that public schools should teach no moral values whatever . they should not teach tolerance , because that offends the intolerant ; they should not teach racial equality , because that offends racists ; they should not teach religious freedom , because that offends religious bigots . maybe they should not teach the immorality of theft and murder because that offends thieves and murderers . i am truly surprised to hear a right - winger such as your good self advocating that public schools should promote a moral vacuum . but then , i suppose anything is better than teaching acceptance of gay families as just another sort of family among the many that exist today .	1
then go away . if you have no interest , then why on earth are you even here to debate ? besides this , you are trying to put killing human beings on the same platform as animals or organic plant life . i ' d seriously suggest you reconsider your views on what exactly is more important . you cannot put those things together , they mix about as well as oil and water . if the court or parental unit is not allowed to interfere with abortion plans , does the mother have the right to kill the child ? who is she to interfere with her child ' s life if her own parents can not make her live with a baby she can just give up for adoption ? by the way , only 1% of abortions are made because of rape . if it were my decision , i would outlaw abortion altogether for the other 99% who have abortions irresponsibly and save over a million lives . do not get me wrong , i do feel for victims of such crimes , but a few thousand hardly outweighs over a million . and they do not even have to die ! they just have to live with a baby for a few months , and they can get on with their lives ! it ' s more of a chance than the baby will get otherwise . so , in your scenario , prototype , are you anti - choice folk going to force us who believe in choice , who believe that a woman owns her very own body , are you going to place us in re - education jails so that we , too , believe that a fertilized egg is a human being ?	1

i like how the chinese view christians . they simply cannot figure out why so many missionaries go over to china and try to convert people . the chinese are so lenient about religion that many practice several different religions and do not have such strict codes as christianity . one reason for conversion is that they do practice many religions . jesus said he is the only way to god . i believe that , so how can i just turn a blind eye when people follow so many different religions ? i would not be following the commands of my lord .	0
why has not natural selection weeded out species with their inferior " optical vision " and given them all echolocation , which would allow them superior senses in day and night , rather than just daytime ? because natural selection works on a cost / benefit basis . for bats and whales and cave - dwelling birds echolocation confers huge advantage , allowing them to exploit niches closed to competing species . for ground - or tree - dwelling terrestrial animals , it would be of marginal or zero benefit , given the ' noise ' in their immediate surroundings .	0

i am leaving the job to those more qualified . i am weighing the yes - votes against the no - votes , and the yes - votes are strongly winning . this is what the word consensus means . qualified global warming skeptics still seem to me to be a small minority . 650 are mentioned in this report . but when i think of all the climate scientists in the world , there must be tens or hundreds of thousands on the other side of the debate . which leaves us with ? if you said ' an appeal to majority ' you win teh prize ! you are not really leaving it to them when you are talking about enacting legislation based on a theory which is still under debate . most doctors will not prescribe marijuana in this country either . i guess we should just leave that to them though , since they are more qualified .	1
as explained the last time we crossed paths matthew , there is no evidence presented that would suggest homosexualism is in any way a legitimate aspect of life for differentiating one from another . simply because you possess different sexual ideals from someone else does not mean that you and those like you are worth special consideration by society . your continued comparison of homosexuals to blacks does nothing to make your point anymore valid . religion is nothing but a choice but is constitutionally protected . why ? blacks and homosexuals are two different classes , unless you are a black gay . it is the way each class is treated that is the same . coservative christians view gay people in the same way as the white supremacists view black people . the more religion attacks gay people and our civil rights the more i am begining to believe that the romans had the right idea to rid the world of such filth .	0

[ to supersport ] your clumsy bait and switch was beginning a discussion about evolution and then trying to represent the seasonal change in color of foxes as evolution . let us not confuse our readers . supersport is not saying it ' s evolution ; he ' s saying that " evolutionists " say that it ' s evolution . it should be clear now to the readers that scientists recognized perfectly well that this is an example of plasticity .	0
did you expect a creationist to understand the definition of honesty ? he ' s a creationist for crying out loud . their manta is " to lie , steal , cheat , and defraud anyone " to get their message across . just making sure that everybody is aware of his evasion , misrepresentation , and dishonesty . i figured a good time to do that would be while he was accusing scientists of these things . <repeated> ( i figure it ' s a damn good illustration when a paper ' s author tells him to stop misrepresenting the paper , and he keeps doing it anyway . ) in fairness , being a creationist is not necessarily an indicator of dishonesty ; there are plenty of creationists who are creationists simply because they are uneducated about the subject . unfortunately , supersport is not part of this group ; he has seen the evidence and is willfully ignorant of it .	0
you ' d have to show me their announcements of bias and conspiratorial intent , before i ' d agree that they are as bad as you imply , but i have no question that they admit the possibility of extrapolation of id for religious purposes far more than atheists admit the possibility of extrapolation of evolution for atheistic purposes . why ? because christians have guidelines about lying . i feel a no true scotsman coming on . should i even bother to mention hovind ?	1

i ' d love to hear how some of these anti - theists would explain how to square wiping out all evil ( decisions with negative consequences ) while leaving people freedom of choice . you do not want to be mindless robot , eh ? ' course not . but do not blame god for all the evil in the world when you know one ( evil ) can not exist without the other ( freedom ) . so god would rather have evil in the world than infringe freedom . how very libertarian of you , jyoshu . but actually , are evil and freedom inversely proportionate ? look at the examples i gave : slavery is both evil and an infringement on human freedom . on top of that , god puts evil into people and then does not take responsibility when these people do evil things . <repeated> not to mention the evil that he himself has done . murder , genocide , bigotry . <repeated> the lot . if he made people with complete freedom , he <allcaps> must </allcaps> have made people with evil as well . why did he do that ? the only reason i can come up with is that if god made everyone in his image , he himself must be evil , even partially . that that is apparent in the bible .	0

can anyone make a rational argument as to why executing a criminal who was 18 years old when committing the crime is not " cruel and unusual punishment , " but executing a criminal who was less than 18 at the time of the crime would be cruel and unusual ? put another way , can anyone explain why it is constitutional to execute a person who was 18 years old when they committed the crime , but it is unconstitutional to execute a person who was under 18 when they committed the crime ? participants in this discussion should assume that the death penalty , in general , is constitutional . this has been the case from the beginning of our republic , and has been reaffirmed multiple times . in other words , it is not an appropriate argument to try and argue that the death penalty , in general , is unconstitutional . that has neither been the case through our history , and is not the current state of the law . * note : i am speaking within the context of the united states , and its constitution . i think that we have got to draw a line at some point , to demarcate between adult and child . where ever we do draw it , it will seem , in some situations to be arbitrary . if we made it 20 , the question would be why 20 year olds and not 19 . through the years society has determined that by 18 people should have attained enough life experience to form intent and to comprehend that their actions have consequences ( at least as it applies to the death penalty , they can be tried as adults w / o death ) . we do not execute people who can not comprehend the nature of their crimes and society says that , under 18 you can not fully comprehend criminal actions .	0

they should be discredited , and their hypocrisy should be exposed . here we have people trying to deny other people the right to marry , supposedly in " defense " of " traditional marriage , " when some of them are out sneaking around , cheating on their wives , and lying about it when confronted . the only reason this guy admitted the truth is because evidence surfaced about his visits to prostitutes . meanwhile , has has tried to advance his political career at the expense of gay people . some defender of marriage ! this is a classic example of someone needing to get the log out of his own eye . so , in order to be against gay marriage , a person has to be faithful in his own marriage ? gimme a break . he supports what his constituents want him to support or he does not get elected . in case you have not noticed , the majority of americans are against gay marriage .	1

then your argument too is flawed by the same principals of debate . because ? the conventional big bang is just as unlikely as god . therefore your claim is wrong . however the current believe mainly among physicists and astronomers is that there is no end and there is no beginning to the universe . expansionary theories along with contractionary theories that are being observed have led many to believe that the current universe was born from the death of the last universe . there is no end and there is no beginning . you are out of your league .	0
fire and tool use means that having a big brain becomes less of a disadvantage and more of an advantage now that you can feed it yea but you have to have the brains to build a fire before it becomes an advantage . sigh . but a slightly larger brain than average is still feasible and offers enough of a benefit in a large social group that its worth the price - however something the size of a modern humans brain is far too demanding . that slightly larger brain can be supported by an organism or society that has not developed fire , but is also able to discover the uses of it , from then on nutrician is not the big limiting factor that restricts how big a brain can get from then on .	0

genisis includes many events and personel that have been proven to take place and lived . why would a book be right about the lives and events recorded in it and wrong about origin . because the men who wrote it mixed their mythology in with their heros . the first 11 chapters of genesis are obviously mythology . and if what you say is true , then i guess that means that the illiad is historical . why would homer be right about some lives and events , but wrong about others ? and of course , there are other parts of the bible that are pure fiction - jonah and job for example .	0
not really . that ' s the fallacy of exclusion of the middle . because there are only two choices , if one is wrong somehow , the other is therefore correct . the problem is that there is not only two choice for sure . besides , science is wrong all the time , it does not prove that creation is right . in fact , for instance , science estaimtes of moon dust have been proven wildly wrong , and those corrections actually harm creation . you know that , i know that , but the creationists do not know that .	0

3 a ) if you do the math , severe earthquakes ( caused by god ) could have very easily covered the earth in approximately 2 miles of water at some points . also , with these severe earthquakes , not all of the earth would have to be covered equally at one time . there could have been some parts shallow enough to actually see the ground below . 3 b ) who said the earth started out as a flat super continent ? i believe that god made the earth only a few thousand years ago , not that much geographically different from the way it is now . you contradict yourself . if the earth was then much as it is today , then there is not enough water on earth to cover it in any fashion . i have done the math . do you have any idea of how high the himalayas , the alps , the andes , and the rockies are ? besides , the bible talks about a flood that lasted a year , not a series of tsunamis .	0
we really are going around in circles on this . <repeated> my bible through the <allcaps> rcc </allcaps> and jesus christ says all life is sacred including that life in the womb . <repeated> then why does god order the killing of the unborn in the womb in hosea 13:16 . what did they ever do to god ? does god fear these people so much he has to have unborn members of their community killed . un born members who could not have possibly done anything to god !	1
the people ' s interest trumps your right to privacy when a warrant is issued . a nics check addresses the ' with no knowledge ' part of your scenario . this is what i support . ca law already . that ' s a real laugh , coming from someone with so little knowledge of the legal and justice systems as you . do you even know what goes into obtaining a search warrant ? do you know what the limitations are regarding the scope of a search warrant and how it has to be narrowly tailored to something specific and nothing else ? right . and it was ca law that lead to a father ' s children being murdered because he thought he was obligated to keep his guns locked up at all time , making them inaccessible even in a true life or death emergency . it was also california law that proved just how registration can , does and will , lead to confiscation . they proved our case for us and showed everyone that we were not paranoid , and instead knew exactly what we were talking about .	0
because if you can murder the unborn to prevent its suffering , you can murder the baby to prevent his suffering . no you can prevent the life of the unborn because they are not living but i do not think you should end the life of the born .	0
if i am to believe in something even if it ' s scientific , i should be able to challenge the belief ' s of the person who ' s pushing it . if they do not believe in what they are selling , why should i . so why should you care about their non - scientific beliefs in a debate on science ? most people who believe in evolution do so because of science , so their non - scientific beliefs are irrelevant .	0
let them make the descision . of course i do not know if they are better off , but neither do you . therefore only they know what ' s best for them and they should be the one making the descision . i see no problem here . but i see two people involved here . whether the women is better off or not is irrelevant to me . she has no right to kill the other just like you have no right to kill your neighbor . i am not for allowing decisions on everything and to be against " choices " is not a bad thing considering every law restricts choices .	0

poet , have you ever heard of pascal ' s wager ? just a random thought . not necessarily the best reason for belief in god . maybe you can look it up on the net . poet i found it interesting your illutration of the ' matirx ' series . i too have seen the two episodes and found it filled with religious overtones . i dont know the faith of the wachaski brothers but there story is intreging . all mankind decived by this lifstyle which as seen from reality is merely a save to produce power . much like mankind is decived by satan today . a select group of people who believe that a savior wil come to free man kind from this savery . even those who have seen the truth and reject it . this sounds alot like the account of the bible . i want so much to see the final episode to find if the theme continues . will neo ' s death be that which saves all mankind ? we will wait and see .	1

among homosexual men in particular , casual sex , rather than committed relationships , is the rule and not the exception . and even when they do enter into a more committed relationship , it is usually of relatively short duration . for example , a study of homosexual men in the netherlands ( the first country in the world to legalize " marriage " for same - sex couples ) , published in the journal <allcaps> aids </allcaps> in 2003 , found that the average length of " steady partnerships " was not more than 2 < years ( maria xiridou et al . , in <allcaps> aids </allcaps> 2003 , 17:10 2 9 - 1038 ) . and where did they find the participants for this study , bath houses and bars ? gay men are a hidden population in statistical relms . it is very hard to get a true random sample of data on gay men . studies will say whatever the funder of the study wants it to say . you just get data from the right place . if you want gay men to look like raging alcoholics get your study participants in a bar . if you want them to look like sexaholics then you get your study subjects in bathouses . the truth is that to have honest statistical data you need <allcaps> random samples </allcaps> .	1
lmao ! did you read my last sentence , the conclusion of my post ? and i quote : " so to answer your question : yes " damn im so evasive ! since you asked the question again , ill answer again <snip> stuff about us being in a democratic system </snip> as a christian , if a legal matter is being contested , and you want to oppose it , you are certainly welcome to do so . as a gay , if you want to propose a legal matter , a christian should be equally welcome to contest it . it is doing unto others as they would have others do unto them , so to answer your question : yes was that so hard ? anti gay christians do want gays to oppose their , marriages , discriminate against them , oppose christians from being able to adopt , and practice thier religion . since anti gay christians are doing all these things to gay people then that is how they want gay people to treat christians .	1
governmental funding is not available ( to my knowledge ) without some ( if not total ) government control of the program . if there ' s any sure way to install inefficiency in a program , it is to let the government run it . i favor privatization , allowing those who want the program to fund and control it , those who do not to decline . donations would be tax deductible . even with tax deductible status , i seriously doubt there ' s enough of a market available yet to make privatization a going concern . since all people will ostensibly benefit from whatever flows from the space program , it seems like government is still the only option now . sure , the russians are capitalizing on their experience by taking citizens for rides , but what are they really learning or advancing there ? they are getting more and more vocal about us funding their stupid space station . the europeans are primarily interested in the lucrative satellite - launching business ; again , where ' s the hard science ? so it seems to fall to the americans - - surprise . but if we do not do it , the chinese certainly will . in all probabilities , they will be fierce competitors , imo .	0
we were not competing with chimps ? oh really ? does not evo claim that the first humans and hominids appeared in africa ? and is not the dark continent also the natural and original ecosystem where the great apes are from ? so how do you claim we never competed if evo is true ? because africa is not one big homogeneous ecosystem . there are jungles , plains , deserts , swamps . himps living in the jungle were not in competition with himps that started migrating out onto the plains . their food sources are different , their territories are different . the more suited to plains - dwelling we became , the less attractive a prospect it was to return to the jungle . pretty straightforward , really .	0

the question is why did you change the sentence ? as has been said , the thermonuclear reaction taking place in the core of the sun is not mentioned in the theory of evolution . so , you managed to make the first sentence of your ' proof ' complete and utter rubbish . not a good start then . some other questions i would like answered about your ' proof ' would be : why is it assumed that the nuclear reaction taking place in the sun ' s core would be perfectly linear ? from above , if the sun ' s life is around 10 billion years , why would 4.6 billion years be its half - life ? do you know what a half - life is with regards to nuclear reactions ? that ' s just the first paragraph . if you can answer them satisfactorily then i might get onto the rest of your ' proof ' . smiley as i said , for clarification , and no other reason . it ' s all drivel to me anyway , so i did not see the problem in adding evolution onto theory . show where it said that if you would , and clarify your question . if you will notice , it said approximately , not exactly half its life . i am surprised you could not deduce that by just reading what it said . why are you asking me this question smiley as if i wrote the article ? can not you tell the difference between quoting a piece and writing it ?	1
this is a major defeat for the pastafarian movement and the church of the flying spaghetti monster . if intelligent design creationism can not be taught in public school science classes , then there ' s little hope for fsmism to be taught as an alternative . all we wanted was a little balance between science and faith and for that balance to be initially manifested from the bottom up , not from the top down , which has been the case ever since the materialists and athiests . . . . the athiest materialists for some time to come . . . . well , there ' s still kansas . aw shucks ! and i reckon in kansas they will not ever care whether or not you learn how to spell <allcaps> atheist </allcaps> .	1

socialism , communism and capitalism are not the only choices for how to organize an economy . also , the us at present is neither " pure capitalist " nor socialist . i do believe that some people should re - evaluate their definitions of socialism , as they seem confused about what it is . the us is still the closest thing to a pure capitalist country in the world . but you are correct , our system is not a pure capitalist one . we have reminants of all types of systems including socialism . in the modern world i do not think a society as large as the us is could be run under just one pure system .	0

i can appreciate this slant , however i think that a true feminist approach would be to support women who want their pregnancies by finding solutions to the reasons they feel an abortion would be their best choice . if we want to have a child , society should be backing us up on that . instead , i see such a stigma for single mothers , i see single mothers unable to finish school , i see single mothers unable to work a decent job b / c of either lack of education or lack of child care , i see systems where the men do not have to support , violence , et cetera . that ' s not something you can really blame on the pro - life movement . in fact , a lot of effort in the pro - life movement does go into helping single mothers . many pro - life counseling services help single mothers offering support in a variety of ways , including financially .	0

also , if the christian worldview is against rape , why does moses say that yahweh allows the israelites to take the virgin children of the midianites captive to do with what they would in numbers 31 ? well , first , those were hebrews , not christians . secondly , the scripture does not say they raped them , it says " keep them for yourselves . " that could mean rape , however , i am pretty sure that was not moses ' s intention . also , the hebrews considered it impure to lie with non - hebrew women or men , so if there was any sexual immorality going on it was very small . however , that <allcaps> doesn </allcaps> ' t mean it was justified or right .	0

a few blocks from my house there is a group of stores with some offices on the second floors . apparently there is a planned parenthood office in the complex because a group of anti - abortion protestors were there the other day . i did not know that before then . i wondered what they hoped to accomplish by their protest so i asked them . one woman said she hoped to discourage women from considering abortion . i did not think of it at the time , but planned parenthood does a lot more than abortion services . i wonder if the protests might also dissuade a young woman who was seeking contraceptive services from going into that office as well . if this were the case , the abortion protests would accomplish the opposite of their goal . they potentially could have increased the chances of an unwanted pregnancy by discouraging contraceptive use . in turn , this might increase the chances of an abortion . i wonder if anti - abortion folks ever consider that ? the goal of anti - abortionist is clear . the job of self restraint is that of each participant in their close encounters .	0

what ' s the point in inviting a bunch of famous people ? i say this as a huge fan of deniro ' s and scorsese ' s: a dinner party would be not be as intellectually stimulating than if you had , say , descartes and kierkegaard in their place . sure , they have probably a hell of a lot of stories and anecdotes which would prove entertaining , but they are . <repeated> they are filmmakers , of all things ! why not invite a bunch of famous people ? de niro is an incredibly interesting guy ; my brother used to work on many films with him as a lighting specialist . he was one of the few folks that actually got to know him . scorsese , on the other hand , i am sure , like you said , has tons of stories and anecdotes , all of which i ' d love to hear ! i have got my fair share of intellectual , spiritually magnificent people : ghandi , nietzsche and morello are all fantastic people .	0

guilty of the rapes i am not disputing ( do not know anything about those cases ) , but why does that automatically make him guilty of the rape and murder for which he was executed ? because he was found guilty of murdering a minor rather than an adult . any crime committed by an adult against a child is more heinous in nature .	0
it ' s not surprising that 21 million people would vote for moore ' s feces . more than that voted for john french kerry . in yellow dog politics , you vote for whatever the party puts up . it ' s been a political fiasco and the liberals are p i s s e d . to put any credence in the election , i ' d have to know how it was run . who was allowed to vote ? [ i did not get a ballot . ] could people vote more than once ? did only the " liberal " city - folk and hollywood incest droppings get to vote ? if you believe that moore ' s film is the best because it got the most votes , then you must believe that bush is the best , because he did , too . thank you . winning any political election has never been about electing the " best " man for the office , it simply means you appeal to the majority of people that showed up to vote . smartest and most popular are not necessarily the same person , if you went to school you probably remember that . <wink>	1
the reason we make maps of the universe on the scale of billions of light years is that the scientific method has led us to that tentative but evidentially robust conclusion . i mean , look at this . a section of the sky the width of a dime 75 feet away , crammed with galaxies . and there ' s nothing special about that dime ' s worth of sky , either . crammed with them , sure , why not ? it ' s easy , only a few million light years . the scientific method is used in weather forecasting too .	1

so you can tell me the athletes that were brought into the school to specificially play sports are going to abide by all the rules as well as the students that attend the school at their free will also , are going to spend 15 hours a week studying ? i do not think so . its more of a lesure activity than a serious requirement . do you go to study hall ? probably not . it is a requirement where the athletes sign in and sit in the library with their teams and are monitored to make sure that their studying is getting done .	1
a more logical explanation is that there may have been racist gun laws during a certain time period but gun control is not inherently racist . gun control maintains its racist roots even in this day and age . what other reason would there be for form 4473 to ask applicants what their race is ? what is the importance of knowing if somebody ' s white , black or mexican when they are buying a gun ?	0

i am incredibly surprised you have not got it now , especially as you put your stance as ' libertarian ' . i am not a libertarian because i want to legalize drugs and prostitution or remove the age limit on alcohol and cigarettes . if the definition of libertarian has became that , the world is seriously screwed up . i am a libertarian because in my country , the taxes are above abnormal . 50 - 65% for an average salary , and up to 80% for a ' ' millionaire ' ' basically no one can be rich in my country . every time i get my salary , i am looking really forward to it . i work hard for my money , but it is tearing me down mentally , that half my money is taken away to pay for some alcoholic who is to drunk to get his money himself . it is killing the working spirit in me , and several others . that ' s why i am a libertarian . libertarianism emphasises freedom of the individual , and limited government . a stereotypical libertarian view would be for the legalisation of prostitution . that ' s why i am surprised .	0
how many times is god referred to in the context of " spirit of god " though ? eighty - nine times . still quite a junior partner . i must admit that he does not like to be slighted though , as evidenced by luke 12:10 . one can say some nasty things about the son of man , and all ' s fine . but say one off - colored comment about the holy ghost and it ' s lakes - o - fire time . he needs to get thicker skin , <allcaps> imo </allcaps> . do ghosts have skin , <allcaps> btw </allcaps> ?	1
oh <allcaps> my god </allcaps> , you are not even smart enough to look around you and recognize the workings of the living god , and you have the nerve to question my intelligence ? well personally i tend to always question the intelligence of someone who believes that that a cosmic jewish zombie who was his own 2000 year old space god father can make you live forever if you symbolically eat his flesh and telepathically tell him you accept him as your master , so he can remove an evil force from your soul that is present in humanity because a rib - woman was convinced by a talking snake to eat from a magical tree . <repeated>	1
perhaps . but which would you rather have : promiscuity without protection or with ? the distinction can matter , so if there is going to be promiscuity going on , i for one would perfer to see it be safe - sex , as much as possible . but even better would be if a person not being promiscuous at all , imo anyway . if the distinction matters , then what is your point about promiscuity , exactly ? misinformation msleads people into thinking that if the significantly curtail the number of partners they have sex with , that they would eliminate the chance of contracting disease . that is not true . it just takes one time with an infected person . protection is what people should be arguing . it would be much better if people were upfront about sex and sexuality , upfront about their hiv status , and used protection at all times during sex .	0

ironic , since your " out of china " post was basically the same as this post . you even claim you had no debate point , you were just posting " information " . it wasn ' t until you claimed that evolution relied on those two mutual theories that we proceeded to debate . maybe this young 13 year old christian is just following in your golden footsteps . <repeated> you might give them a little leeway if you , yourself , do this as well . or are you above the rules of the average forum participant ? hmm <elongated> . - mach mach , your ability to make the wrong argument on the wrong post continues . i ask a question of this person , you reply not to them , but to me , and with ad hominem , and a ' just - so ' statement .	0

do you not understand what is currently going on ? the ruling on whether the california state constitutional amendment was enacted " legally " was ruled on by the courts . what is discussed above is entirely separate . to say something brief to get you up to speed , our state constitution <allcaps> cannot </allcaps> violate the federal constitution . so if prop 8 violates the 1 4 th amendment , then prop 8 loses . whether or not prop 8 violates the 1 4 th amendment is the question that is currently being examined . if <allcaps> doma </allcaps> is not declared unconstitutional , then those arguing against prop 8 are micturating into the wind .	0

clearly is not necessarily correctly ! even though his statement is convoluted , your calculation based on it , is correct . however , it is more easily understood as : ( pop a ) x . 06 =( pop b ) x . 44 ( pop b ) / ( pop a ) = . 06 / . 44 = . 1364 = 13.64% one should remember , too , that ( pop b ) is still part of ( pop a ) . however , i think the claim is more than slightly exaggerated . the prison population can not have increased that much since 2003 , when it was 482 per 100,000 , or about 0.4% . the nearly 14% number is obviously too high . the prison population was roughly 1.47 million in 2004 . with a population of roughly 295,000 , 000 , this means 1.47 / 295 =0 . 5% of the population is in prison . a far cry from 13.64% <url> <url> . <repeated> and this site says 645 out of 100,000 or 645 / 100,000 =0 . 0065 =0 . 65% . <repeated> still miles from 13.64% i am shocked ! how could hunter mislead me so ? emoticonxrolleyes given his previous output , i have to confess that i am not at all surprised that this was a garbage in , garbage out moment . i feel slightly embarrassed at not stopping to consider the preposterous nature of a 14% figure though emoticonxembarrassed	1

5 ) show me one instance of an evolutionist ( any book , any website ) admitting that “ evolution ” may not be evolution at all , but simply an individual organism ' s ability to utilize his genetic diversity and adapt himself to his local environment – that selection may not have anything to do with phenotypic change . <repeated> and instead of vertically , evolution first happens horizontally . ( a trait of a good scientist is to consider opposing viewpoints and alternatives , not to ignore them . ) apart from the ' horizontally instead of vertically ' part which i did not understand - we are a hundred or so years too late , unfortunately . you might as well ask for an example of a book or website on cosmology that ' admits ' the sun may just be a big ball of fire pushed by a scarab beetle , and not a nuclear furnace about which the earth orbits . there comes a point where continuing to seriously ' consider ' a viewpoint becomes a waste of time and resources , because sufficient testing has been done and evidence recovered to discount it . we may one day encounter evidence that completely overturns the whole applecart , but so far it has not happened .	0
how , though darwin is often credited with citing " overwhelming evidence " for his theory of natural selection , all he actually provided was " one or two imaginary illustrations " of how the process might work pretty good considering darwin wasn ' t aware of genetics . too bad wells is stuck in 1859 . the modern synthesis provides perfectly legitimate mechanisms .	0

this statement is wrong . people from hundreds of years before jesus was born prophesied that a baby would be born , in bethlehem , of a virgin . there were over 50 more prophesies that were made about his life , and the sacrafice he made to pay for the sins o the egyptians predicted his birth , death , <allcaps> wwi </allcaps> , <allcaps> wwii </allcaps> , and they have predict the supposed end of the world . are you saying that this religion was wrong ? they predicted a lot more that i have not put that have come true .	0

where are those who hate all christians that are members of congregations led by those radical preachers that abhor homosexualality ? why have they not spoken out against this hatred of white people espoused by obama ' s mentor and spiritual advisor ? why is obama still a member of a hate - driven church ? can you support a first lady that was not proud of the united states until her husband went to the top ? do you suppose she hates white people like her pastor seems to ? what connection does the obama campaign have with the black panther party ? it appears to me that the democrats will soon have a chance to elect a real monster . <repeated> no matter which one they decide to promote . isly , where are those who hate all christians that are members of congregations led by those radical preachers that abhor homosexualality ? where are all those puported ' christians ' who have been misled by radical preachers into hating homosexuals ? the country has far more to fear from them than it does from a black preacher who dares to speak truth to power .	0

my second disagreement with the paper is a computer would be useless to model living systems , because a computer cannot model volition , the defining characteristic of life . well firstly we do not know that " volition " must be embodied in living organisms only - computers <allcaps> might </allcaps> be capable of exhibiting it . i think you will find that there is no valid reason for believing otherwise . and volition itself is <allcaps> not </allcaps> a defining characteristic of life . no biologist would buy that assumption . sponges , bacteria , corn plants etc etc etc are mindless organisms and so far as can be determined do not act out of volition .	0

creationism , by the way , is used very broadly . it is simply the study of how we were created , just as evolution is the study of how we " evolved " . no , creationism is the specific idea that the creation story in genesis is literally true ( creation ex nihilo , direct creation of organisms , global flood , etc ) . it is false .	0
it is a good thing . but why must we destroy the earth and 2 / 3 rds of humanity to accomplish it ? that is the downside to the end of the age saga which is coming . you can liken it to when god poured out the plagues on egypt because pharaoh refused to free his people . that event will be repeated again , only on a world wide basis . and it will be in response to antichrists actions against his people . what is this " we " stuff ? got a mouse in your pocket ? i thought god was going to destroy it . <repeated> not " we " .	1

the 9 / 11 commission omits the presence of molten steel from their official report . it took weeks for rescue workers to water - cool the glowing steel beneath the wreckage at ground zero . it was clearly and prominently visible in a thermal image taken by a usgs satellite on september 16 - - five days later . in the video , one of the workers states that it has been almost 6 weeks after the attacks , and workers are still trying to cool down the steel . the 9 / 11 commission and supporters of the official story do not try to make the claim that office fires produce molten steel . they just ignore it . the 9 / 11 commission omits the presence of molten steel from their official report . the 9 / 11 commission omitted it because ? . <repeated> what is this deep dark secret they do not want the american public to know ? which , according to you is easily figured out anyway . ' we could blow up a u . s . ship in guantanamo bay . <repeated> omg . couple of cia guys brainstorming for solutions to a problem and people go nuts . if that ' s the worst of what they contemplated . <repeated> i am not impressed . i am sure conspiracies happen all the time but they are so rare as to be insignifigant . my wife and i can not even agree on a restaurant .	0
in defense of the fruit fly , why would one evolve when one is already suited well to their environment ? what good does a 7 th leg do ? and about the experiment itself - please , always post references . who did the experiment ? when ? under what conditions ? how ? assuming you were correct about the experiment , were variables put in place such as habitat changes to reflect the timeline you speak of , a large variety of fruit flies to begin with , random mating , etc etc or did some people just shoot some x rays at a couple fruit flies , did some arithmetic which was probably wrong and called it that ? and im sorry , but there is mountains of direct evidence for evolution , you just need to go and look at it . i am totally surprised i have posted so many posts in this thread : not like me at all .	0
and you notice how he just ignores my response to his attack and continues to post off topic drivel reminiscent of penfold and chester . these people do not come here to debate issues . all they are here for is to derail debates and insult those they disagree with . and subaru does not even have the class to adopt a name of a good car like lexus or infinity . kind of say ' s it all i think . emoticonxhoho dear smiling , friendly , forgiving archangel : i would be quite happy to respond to you if you could organize your incoherent mental states into logical , debatable points . please refer to chester ' s questions for bible - thumpers for guidelines . as for staying on topic : since there is no god , it is rather pointless to have religious ceremonies in any case , is not it ? as for my nom de web , you have missed the point altogether . either you are not quick on the uptake and / or you are completely ignorant of the japanese language . hint : surely you have seen the starry emblem on all subaru cars ? to end on a conciliatory note : i entirely agree with the last sentence of your posting [ except the punctuation ] . -	1
i am a christian , so i believe that the meaning of life is to be re - acquainted with god and to live your life in according to his word . which , in my opinion is a far better life than : " i am born of chance , i did not ask to be here , i serve no purpose , so i might as well live egocentrically for the next 78.4 years until my life ends . " 78.4 years ? well excuse me but i intend to live much longer than that . i was thinking about 112.7 years . yeah . that ' s about right .	1
yes , we do . and the truth is a person , jesus christ ( john 14 : 6 ) . has any major truth concerning jesus ' life , death , or resurrection in the new testament ever been shown to have been substantially changed or proven wrong ? no ! if you claim otherwise , prove it . one other thing : when were the books of the new testament written ? scholars give their expert opinions : dating the nt too bad you are so steeped in denial over christ that you can not see the forest for the trees . 1 john 2:22 - 23 : ' who is the liar ? it is the man who denies that jesus is the christ . such a man is the antichristhe denies the father and the son . no one who denies the son has the father ; whoever acknowledges the son has the father also . ' jesus is lord ! other than showing your ability to bold your false or irrelevant claims what was accomplished here ? as for the date that the nt books were written , more importance could be given to those guesses if any still existed or if early christians could have refrained from changing the word of god . sorry current christians do it also so unfair to blame just the early ones .	1
you have not provided any evidence the bible is a fairy tale . but i do think you like the sound of those last two words in the previous sentence . it ' s god or the government ( romans 13 ) in the nt who dispense capital punishment . if you were not so consumed with your illicit gay sex escapades to read the nt you would have known that . keep screwing around and god himself just might take you and / or your buddy jazy off the earth like he did with annanias sapphira in the book of acts . wow , everyone ' s just shakin ' in their boots that your imaginary god will magick them off the earth ! emoticonxkillemoticonxkillemoticonxkillemoticonxbanghead	1
in some people ' s minds god ' s existence has already been proven . also , some people are totally convinced that god does not exist . believing whether god exists or not is a huge factor in not only determining day to day decisions , but entire identities and lifestyles . that seems to beg the question . be convinced one way or the other as much as you like , but if you can not prove your position , or even provide evidence for it , then how can you possibly use it to justify anything ? yes , people ' s religious beliefs influence them . what shooter seems to be asking is if that ' s in any way reasonable ? if you are basing your entire life on some point , should you be able to show that your beliefs about that point are true ? put another way , it ' s kinda dumb to base major life decisions on a feeling , is not it ?	0
as long as ma ' am has consented as an equal partner to the wham - bam and is pleased with the outcome , perfectly proper . if i were religious , and believed my scriptures to be god - given , and they told me that sex outside marriage was sinful , i would not think so either . as none of the foregoing applies . <repeated> good one , johnhanks .

so you do not consider a woman ' s right to vote a civil right ? <repeated> interesting . emoticonxwow the civil rights act of 1964 and the amendments were the most relevant and influential elements in civil rights - - it seems the trend these days in your movement is to not use acts and amendments but instead to use the courts as a means to an end to avoid using an act or amendment . probably because you know you have a snowball ' s chance in hell of getting one . i so love it when you have to work so hard to avoid any points i made . i take it as assent to my original post .	1

i checked the vpc website - the number includes 15 suicides . only a very small percentage of homicides are classified as self defense killings according to the fbi so it ' s improbable that most of these killings can be explained away as being self defense killings . if you check again you will find they do have self defense shootings in the list as well as accidents . the point is , as even you have now pointed out , the number is flawed . the source , vpc , knowingly used false data to further their claim . therefore eliminating any validity to their claim . you and brady continue to trot out biased and inaccurate sources to back your arguement . you should stop , it does great harm to your credibility . wow , you really can leap tall mounds of logic in a single bound . what evidence do you have that any of these deaths would have been prevented by banning concealed carry ? then also consider the lives saved by concealed carry , such as mine .	0
and if gay marriage is legalized , what ' s to stop people from using the same argument to legalize marrying animals ? or themselves ? all they would need to say is " come on , everyone thought gay marriage would lead to the downfall of man , but it has not , and neither will legalized [ insert marriage concept here ] " your argument is evidence of the gradual process you purport not to exist . i still have not seen an adequate rebuttal to this . why can not people marry themselves if they are in love with themselves ? i must have missed your response .	1
i do not keep track of who is who , but whoever is pushing for hate crime laws that establish gays as a protected group with special legal rights . on the other hand there are some groups pushing only for equal rights , e . g . in marriage and in the abolition of discriminatory laws . utterly irrelevant . i have no interest in groups ' classifiying equal rights as special rights ' , i am talking about some demanding special rights , others equal . again , utterly pointless . i believe in equal rights for all people . not one set of rights for whites , one for blacks , one for women , one for men , one for gays , one for straights . that apparently means i hate gays . take a look at this garbage : <url> not true at all . hate crime legislation protects straights as well as gays . nothing ' special ' there . so you make a claim , but can provide no example to document the veracity of your claim . meh . <repeated> what i expected . the ruling is garbage . ' ex - gays ' are supposedly straight , right ? so they are already protected under existing legislation . if we had a bunch of democrats who changed to republicans , and then insisted they should be known as ' ex - democrats ' , would we need another legal status for them ? no .	1

when i say freedom i mean especially the bolded definitions . most precise is the philosophical definition <hashtag> 17 </hashtag> . 17 . philosophy . the power to exercise choice and make decisions without constraint from within or without ; autonomy ; self - determination . compare necessity ( def . 7 ) . cool i want to be free of the regulation that i wash my hands before preparing other peoples food . after all it should be my choice to wash my hands after going to the restroom and i should be able to make that choice without restraint . in your world there are no courts , police , or governments to hold me accountable for killing someone or giving them hepatitis .	1
' so they do not really kill babies , they just put them in to a long sleep ? is that what you mean ? ' no .

matthew , though i doubt phyllis is aware of either man , her posts sound more like rousseau than locke . if one reads rousseau , one can clearly see why that frenchman was hitler ' s favorite philosopher . check out what he says about the ' general will .

yet evolutionists tell us that evolution could never happen the same way twice . and the reason they say that - - one of them - - is that ns on the level of the population is random . <repeated> which makes absolutely no sense what - so - ever . it does not make sense because no one makes that claim . there are some random events that take place that may have an effect on evolution . that does not mean that evolution is random .	0

no it ' s not . a embryo does not have a developed brain or in the early stages a brain at all . therefore its mental existance is the same as a plant . a fetus is not a embryo . learn your terms . i was under the impression that he was referencing the video . <repeated> since he always interchanges the words embryo and fetus i just rolled with it . secondly , an embryo does have instructions for a brain . <repeated> while a plant does not . i guess the answer hear depends on the ever evolving definition of " mental existence " .	1
i just realized it ' s a waste of time sharing my opinion with you self important <allcaps> x <elongated> </allcaps> who think you have such a grasp on science that you dazzle yourselves into a frenzy . your " opinion " was a kindergarten question outlining a " problem " that never existed , a " problem " that was explained to you 3 or 4 times . how is it our fault that you ask such embarassing questions repeatedly , despite having the answers explained to you repeatedly ? how does this reflect poorly on anyone but you ?	1

well i have to say that i beleive if we banned all air guns that violence , murder , carjackings , rapes , and all violent crime would drop . i think that the bad guys will be happy if any gun control law goes into effect , because then there will be less chance of the victum having a weapon for their defense , and the crime rate will rise ! <repeated>	0
but i see two people involved here . whether the women is better off or not is irrelevant to me . she has no right to kill the other just like you have no right to kill your neighbor . i am not for allowing decisions on everything and to be against " choices " is not a bad thing considering every law restricts choices . but the embryo is a mere clump of flesh inside of a woman ' s body . science proves it . it has no sign of intelligence , it is merely cells at this stage . therefore , it cannot be referred to as another person , or neighbor , and is no where near comparable to a human . choices that harm another should be illegal , but choices regarding your own personal liberty and freedom should be made by the individual . not the government .	0

well , i am not an atheist , but i definitely do not believe in the bible . however , i do not think the " atheists " or the non - christian believers promote morality . our issue is only based in the fact that we are a normal part of society and would very much like to have that respect . on the other side , the fundies say they know what ' s right for everyone and look at us as reprobrates , condemned . <repeated> blah blah blah . do not think we are promoting morality . we are not pedophiles , thieves or evil people . <repeated> but we are constantly condemned by the moral christianists . i think our side of the moral issue is more of a knee - jerk reaction to the jerks on the fundie side . if someone kicked you constantly , would not you eventually kick back . the problem with the fundies is that when we kick back , it hurts . but they feel justified in what they do . it ' s probably defensive to some extent on both sides . a lot of atheists i have run into seem to be out to prostlytize as well - - they are basically evangelists for the atheist way of thinking . religiously atheist , you might say . they are looking for opportunities to assert the atheist message . and i have read some pretty darn hateful things said about christianity right here in these forums , and just chalking it up to be " defending " or " kicking back " does not really fly . who knows who threw the first punch ? it ' s to the point that it does not really matter anymore , because both sides should be showing respect .	0
so what rational reason would there be to deny them the right to marry the person they love ? they can " marry " whomever they love . benefits though , are a different matter . the state and society views marriage as an opposite - sex institution . it ' s not about anyone getting harmed ; no one said it was .	0

no i do not think that all life comes from a single - celled ancestor in the distant past . the first reason for this is my faith in the inherent word of god . secondly , throughout my college education ( majoring in molecular biology ) i have observed the complexities of the single - cell , and find it impossible to believe that it occurred by accident ( though that may not be the best choice of words ) . the more and more we learn about cellular structure , the more complex we find it is and how these complexities are required in order for life to be present at all . so , faith and argument from incredulity . if you find it impossible please state exactly what part is impossible . then maybe an actual scientist could take over . major in molecular biology ? not even a full degree ; not like your going to doing anything original .	1
. <repeated> to curtail abortions . any woman who has an abortion for convenience only ( not raped , no incest , no danger to the mother ' s life ) shall have both ovaries removed . what do you all think ? actually there is a better solution . mandatory male and female birth control pills , financial penalties if you stop taking . anyone who would get off the pill would want a kid , therefore , abortions would cease .	0

this seems to be a mixture of pascal ' s wager and shocking evidence of eternal cruelty and torture from the god of love . pray tell , arch , what is meant by ' the second death ' ? will you confirm or deny that symbolic fire means eternal destruction , not eternal torment ? can you provide scriptures that confirm that the ungodly will be tortured for eternity in indestructible bodies ? why would a god of love torture people for eternity ? why would you want to worship such an evil creature if that was the case ? you mean pascals sucker bet ? if arch is wrong , he ' s wasted a good portion of his life and income catering to a false priesthood , a tick suckling off the fat and meat and marrow of their ' flocks ' . he ' s prevented himself from exploring the wonderful opprotunities this limited life has to offer for the nebulous promises that come after death is assured . furthermore , he ' s extolling others to do so also . because misery needs company to justify itself and in insecurity over the rediculous beliefs they hold , they need numbers to validate their wastes and servitude .	1
you really need to read the posts before embarrassing yourself asking ridiculous questions . the ignorance that child contributes here is enough for any 5 forums , much less this <allcaps> one </allcaps> . amusing coming from someone who falsely claimed another user misused the term " light year .

in case you were wondering , no one here has missed the fact that you are trying to divert attention from the real issues by beating one minor issue into the ground . no i am not kronus . i have not made excuses for him or denied what he did . op said he is a conservative christian which is a lie and i am exposing that lie for what it is . unless she can prove he is anything more than a conservative secular republican , then he is no more a morally responsible person than an atheistic democrat . to attempt to mark all fundamental christians with the actions of this guy because he ' s a republican is a truly fallacious argument and a slanderous lie regarding me and all believers . none of this excuses what vitter himself is responsible for doing . but she is wrong for immorally attempting to paint us all as adulterers because of his sin .	0

i personally am astounded at the overreaction of the government in response to a handfull of shootings in no . sending in the army in full force , confiscating guns and talking about an ' insurgency ' just because of a couple of crackpots have been firing their guns . on an average day in new york there are 10 times as many reports of shootings , yet i do not see such a massive military response over there . <repeated> well , if they have re - established control in new orleans ( and it seems they have ) , then taking a gun away from someone carrying it on the street would be what the police normally do in any city . if they were taking it away from peoples ' homes , and not letting them keep them , that would be over and above what they normally do . ( i am very pro - 2 nd amendment , so do not get me wrong here . i am just pointing out that taking guns away from people happens in every city every day ) i also think that it ' s kind of disingenuous to complain about the military coming in - - just a week ago everyone was criticizing the govt . for <allcaps> not </allcaps> sending in the military . now people are criticizing them for doing it ? <repeated>	0

i would love to see the evidence for that . alas , there is none . i think there one italian archelogist who claims he found some drawings that he believes that the ' mount sinia ' mentioned is different than generally accepted , but i am skeptical of his claims . there are enough screwballs and religious nuts pretending to be archelogists in israel that it takes more than a concensus of 1 for me to consider something . this guy does seem to be more educated than the vendyl jones crowd in archeology , but still a bit on the fringe . maybe he will get more attention , and provide a good set of evidence , because it is the people on the fringe that are needed to shift the paradiam . <repeated> ( then they are visionary , rather than on the fringe ) . i am surprised no one has unearthed some stickman figures and announced that the drawings of jesus have been discovered , as recorded in john 8 : 7 , where he ' s doodling on the ground while some poor young woman is about to get pelted with rocks . what a pilgrimage that would make . <repeated>	1
yeah , he ' s absolutely correct . so what ' s your point ? you think you deserve special rights ? this whole riff where people talk about preventing employers from firing gays <allcaps> just </allcaps> cause they are gay as a " special right " is something that seems to fool those who are prejudiced against gays . <repeated> but for most people , they recognize it as a propagandic phrasing with little merit . i think our laws should include something that prevents people from firing employees based on the employee ' s sexual orientation . but to utilize your phrasing archie , do you think that religion is something that deserves " special rights " ?	0
you talk about the fourteenth amendment and again claim that gun control is racist . if gun control is truly racist then it ' s a wonder that the courts in areas with strict gun control laws have not been flooded with claims of violations of the fourteenth amendment ' s equal protection clause . funny how only a few people on an online message board have managed to figure this out . because the modern application of gun control is to target everyone . but that does not change the fact that gun control began as a purely racist concept .	0
ok ill ask it in a different way has anyone obseved us evolving frmo monkeys ? . <repeated> ( crickets in the background ) walking - fish : has anyone ever observed two atoms combining to form a molecule ? has anyone ever counted out 6.02 x 10 ^ 23 molecules to see if they really make up a mole ? has anyone ever watched the earth for a year from outer space to see if it really does go around the sun ? has anyone ever seen electrons in a copper wire when an eletric current is passed through it ? all scientific disciplines are held together by theories which are inferences about things we cannot directly observe . what is it about science that you do not understand ?	0

you do have a good point . however , it does not change my mind . we do our best to make cars as safe as we can , but so many people need to travel fast just to work and survive . more importantly , when one gets into a car , they know that they run the risk of crashing . i do my best to make my house as safe as i can . firearm possession is one of the means to attain that safety . when the criminal breaks into a home that criminal knows that he runs a risk of earning a chalk outline . remove the firearms and remove the risk to the criminal . consequently , ye increase the risk to the homeowner . but is the gun that you keep in your home a greater risk to yourself or to a potential intruder ? it ' s pretty easy to find information on the <allcaps> fbi </allcaps> and the <allcaps> cdc </allcaps> websites that shows that more people die in gun accidents than criminals die in legally justifiable self defense shootings . people defending guns often only look at the gross benefit of gun ownership , not the net benefit when it comes to safety . that would make about as much sense as only looking at your gross income while ignoring the fact that your net income is negative .	0

and i will bet the formal list of " great physicists " who preceded the development of the theory of evolution is meaningful . i wonder how many of these " great physicists " also believed that night air could make them ill ? how many beleived in alchemy , like newton ? i wonder if newton is in that list ? he did not believe in the divinity of christ . this was a comment on the physics book that has biographies of great physicists that were bible believing christians . right . many believed in alchemy ( they were wrong ) , harmful effects of night air ( they were wrong ) , spontaneous growth of maggots from rotting meat ( they were wrong ) , rats arising from grain ( they were wrong ) , and the bible ( they were wrong ) . if it is important that newton believed in the bible , why is not it as important that he believed in alchemy and did not believe in the divinity of christ . there is not any such thing as science from a christian perspective . either it is science , or it is not . you claimed to have studied evolution . you did not . why would you tell us that you did ?	0

mizmax , that ' s completely different . the infirtle couples who want to have children and are capable of doing so with sciencetific methods may be married . however , infirtle couples who do not have the capability and wont try to , should not . having children is not a requirement for marriage - it ' s what marriage is all about . so , if having children is not a requirement fro marriage , then gays should be ok , right ? if it is what it is all about , if you marry a woman who is incapable of having children , even with scientific methods , then you are not really married ? what about lesbians ? they can have childre , with a little help from the local sperm bank . in facst , they can <allcaps> both </allcaps> get pregnant . does tht mean that a marriage between 2 lesbians is twice as valid ? what if a couple of gay men adopt ? then is their marriage valid ? if i have a vasectomy , am i divorced ? you are confusing me . please explain .	1
the missoula lakes megafloods would pale by comparison . as you both also ignore the fact that it was tq who first posted in the largest red bolded font possible . but hey , since when do you children care about facts or truth . emoticonxrolleyes	1
ok . you dont have a clue where your morals come from . <repeated> is that comprehensible ? you are not clear what the sixth commandment means . <repeated> is that also comprehensible ? yes . so you are indeed committing the genetic fallacy . and apparently unaware of the semantic ambiguity of the sixth commandment . thanks for clarifying .	1
reading around , first post , might as well land here too . notice that one does not post much more than sheep jokes . with his cutie not far behind . is religion in general on the decline ? monotheism is . best wishes . methinks it ' s rather obvious that mintaka is jimirvine because no rational newbie would come here and agree with irvine ' s ridiculous and juvenile attacks / assertions out of the box . emoticonxrolleyes	1
you would probably get much more out of it if you posted a question here , let people reply , then carry on in a similar way asking questions ( even related to replies ) and getting reponses . everyone is welcome to give their opinion on public gun possession here - whether you are for or against gun control ( or does gun possession justifies itself ) and please state the reasons as well . i would really appreciate it if you guys could include some extra informations regarding this issue .	1
you should also note that the one scenario i think the death penalty is acceptable for is if they try to escape using violence or if they attack another prisoner . this has shown that they are willing to commit acts of violence and frankly have nothing to lose . so the initial murder wasn ' t enough to show " that they are willing to commit acts of violence " ? this makes absolutely no sense .	0
a rational explanation of what caused the big bang etc . well , there is now string theory , which has grown into m - theory , which may have a rational answer ( at least a mathematical one ) . but calling it a theory is really a misnomer . it ' s more like a hypothetical model . but , do you have a rational explanation for the big bang ? or do you think that the big bang did not happen ?	0
i agree , there is a difference between faith and inference . it seems though , that there is an element of faith in evolution . you must have faith that the evidence presented is accurate . you have to believe that the scientists are unbiased , etc . do you need faith to know the sun will rise tomorrow or that 2 + 2 = 4 or to know that if you drop a rock it will fall to the ground ?	1
for those who are in christ the tendancy is to be pulled towards good decisions . like the crusades and the inquisition ? how about the southern baptist convention , formed at the end of the civil war with the express purpose to discriminate against blacks ? and of course , the <allcaps> k <elongated> </allcaps> and the aryan brotherhood make the same claims as you . of course , you are going to tell me that you are a christian and they are not . but when people tell me they are christians you are not always around so i just never turn my back on them . that way , even if they are follow that strange pull to make a bad decision , i will at least have my eye on my money .	1
okay , let us look at evolution . oh ! goody ! at last someone who wants to actually discuss evolution instead of mythology !	1
fools ! you have all been decieved ! listen not to the lies of the foodstuff demons , instead bow down to the invisible flying space monkeys , for they are the only path into heaven ! ( wish i ' d thought of the beer volcano . that ' s a good one . ) just be like the jews and christians and steal the idea ! a lot of their mythology is not original : it was stolen from other people who thought it up first .	1
if you really respected my belief , or lack thereof , my kids would not be asking me what god is because they hear it in the pledge and read it on our money . they would not be constantly bombarded with your beliefs when it ' s against my own that they be taught such rubbish . everywhere that atheists try to strip the government ' s endorsement of a belief in god we are fought be theists in their attempt to maintain this endorsement . if you really respected my belief you ' d keep yours to yourself without trying to spread it to me and my family . until then , i will continue to promote the fact that the ' big invisible guy in the sky ' is just another fairy tale . that ' s not because of something i did . that ' s because of something that happened back in the 1 9 5 0 s , i believe . that ' s fine - - go ahead and be offensive ! it will only hamper your efforts because it only makes people angry at you when you belittle things they hold dear . but what about religious people that are not out to do that to you and your family ? if the govt . endorses a religion , remove the endorsement ! that ' s fine . you are still willing to be offensive to all religious people because of fundamentalists ( which are really the ones doing what you describe ! ) . you can be as offensive and show as much lack of respect as you want . it ' s only going to make it harder on you to convince people .	0
read the article , it tells you who found the quote ( site intelligence group ) . in any case , my point is would it matter ? these groups are as likely to be pulling reverse psychology ( at least in public statements ) as anything else , i was pointing out the absurdity of using such endorsements to score political points . btw if you wanted to attack the source , you ' d be far better pointing out that the poster , while posting on an extremist website , is not actually an al qaeda member or representative of any kind . rather than actually doing some research , you just put your fingers in your ears and claim the source does not exist . bs , if it ' s password protected , then how would they access it ? then i suppose america would look lovely as the crater in the death star ! you are telling me to believe that it exists even though there is no evidence that it does ? once again : there ' s a witness in this courtroom who says that i did not kill that guy , but i am the only one who can see him and hear him . in other words , unless the page is showed to me , i have no reason to believe that it exists .	1
oh , and yes that is where i got that information , and took it directly from their web page . and the point was , benjamin , that it is dishonest to cite the work of others , with no indication that it is the work of others . if you take what someone else wrote , they you need to indicate that , telling where you got it . if it is a book , then the author , title , publisher , date and page . if it is a web page , then the <allcaps> url </allcaps> should be given . even better , express your own point and tell how reference supports it . tell why it is important and why it shows your opponent wrong - then just give a link . generally <allcaps> aig </allcaps> is really bad science and is not very interesting . it is misleading , intentionally . however , on these boards are familiar with their stuff .	0
there does not have to be a defined " shot calling " leadership of it any more than there has to be one in judeo christianity . the two are actually comparable - christianity gets its leadership / organization through biblical reference and church leadership . evolution gets its leadership / organization through the philosophical writings of everyone from herbert spencer to richard dawkins . and as i said , herbert spencer ' s ideas predate darwin ' s . meanwhile , dawkins writings on religion are irrelevant to whether evolution is good biology .	0
there is no way to judge on a case - by - case basis . what do you mean by this ? could we not have the law treat under - 18 capital offenders on an individual basis , determining whether the individual offenders in the individual cases were sufficiently developed ? also , what would you say to the response that our current law provides that juveniles are sufficiently developed enough to have the responsibility , without parental involvement , to decide whether to obtain an abortion ? is it not a conflict to say juveniles should not be eligible for the death penalty because they are not morally developed enough , but at the same time say juveniles are morally developed enough to decide whether to obtain an abortion without involving their parents ?	0
in fact , the only feasible way that a tree - swinging monkey could change into a man would be through some freak accident ( aka - - random mutations . ) well , if you breed them , you could get taller monkeys with less hair ( and other humanlike characteristics ) . even so , it would take a long time .	0

your bible of today is as truthful as the religions of the past . it is not the same as the nest day . so ? the assertion was ' evolution is based on evidence - what do you have ' suggesting that one side has ' evidence ' and the other none . i am simply ' balancing ' it out by showing that the assertion is not black vs white as made out .	0
<url> the hell is he to say the love between my partner and i of 8 years is weak ? ! <repeated> it ' s stronger than many heterosexual couples . will the catholics ever elect somebody who is not a complete knob ? he speaks just like he knows something about gay relationships . emoticonxrolleyes	1
hey , does this mean you have found a definition for ' life ' that you like yet ? i am still waiting . <repeated> not quite sure what you are talking about , iangb . and i really do not have time to crack the code so if you have a specific question , just ask it already .	1
in a moment of extreme stress , a previously law abiding citizen might commit an act of violence with his or her firearm . yes , everyone is a " potential " felon . fortunately most people never commit a felony . and there are many different types of weapons , all which could be used by previously law abiding citizens to commit an act of violence .	0
in these experiments posted the scientist are stimulating the simulated environmet with chemicals . they are merely taking chemicals that they can detect in outer space and reproducing the enviroment they are found in , by exposing them to ultraviolet . you are exposed to ultraviolet when you walk outside in the sunshine . every chemical that they used is readily detected in interstellar molecular clouds .	0
still dumb to compare the two . both are no good . theft is better then murder . <repeated> however a theif bragging because he did not murder is a fool . <repeated> chris rock actually did a funny skit on this . so why did you say pot was worse than alcohol ? just because both are apparently bad , does not make one ' worse ' . i will point out that you compared the two first , so saying it ' s dumb to compare the two ' s shooting yourself in the foot .	1

school uniforms are a great leveller . they eliminate the need for competition between the pupils to come to school with the most expensive ' cool ' clothingthus reducing the strain on the parents ' pockets . as for saving money in the uk school uniforms are super cheap , courtesy of those nice chinese clothing manufacturers spoken like someone truly out of touch with reality . how long has it been since you were in high school ? because if it had not been so long you ' d know that short of coming to school in a banana suit ( maybe not even then ) , kids could give two sh*ts <censored> about what other kids are wearing .	1
keep it up zardoz , you only condemn yourself with your anti - christian zealotry and hypocrisy . you claim to properly interpret a bible you admit you do not even accept as truth . the hubris you exhibit would be laughable if it wasn ' t so pathetic . dr has more humble truth in his little finger nail than you have accumulated in your whole spiritually destitute life . if you would sincerely seek a truth greater than yourself , you might actually be set free to find it . and i sincerely do say this out of love . emoticonxangel so you disagree with zardoz then ? true christians are those who profess faith and bear false witness ? true christians are those who are ignorant , vain , boastful insulting liars ? interesting . <repeated>	1
mr . jack , abortion does not have to be done if the amniotic sack is cut . an abortion never has to be done . so you feel that mrs vo should have been allowed to run the risk of dying ? your statement " an abortion never has to be done " only holds true if you place the value of the unborn child over that of the mother in all cases . do you really believe that ?	0
a species of darwin ' s finch in the galapagos has evolved a smaller beak to avoid competing with a larger - billed recent immigrant you know what they mean , i know what they mean , but as someone involved in teaching evolution to high school kids i wish they ' d avoid the implication of purposeful change and just refer to beak size changing in response to new selective pressure . as i said , i may just be being nit - picky . language apart , this is another nice example of evolutionary change happening right before our eyes .	0

god had two choices . he could make creatures that obeyed him completely with no possibility whatsoever of choosing against his will . or he could make free creatures with the choice to love god or not . can you imagine an interesting world where there are no choices ? can there be love without choice ? can robots love ? because adam and eve chose to disobey god they were no longer perfect . all of history since then has been god ' s plan to bring us back to perfection . this is the view many christians have , hope it helps you . only two choices ? poor god , infinity reduced to black or white .	1

america invaded more countries , today has less freedoms ( patriot act and so on ) , of all countries in the world germany is the only one , that has not a ' shady ' history , cause everything has been come to light and regretted . the us still thinks ( your post as an example ) it was / is a force of good . no ' wiedergutmachung ' of american history ( slaves , tortures , drones , dictators ) ' slaves , tortures , drones , dictators ' hmm , what does that sound like ? oh yeah , the history of most european countries , including germany .	1
40 less people dying a year is pretty good news - but i do not think you can attribute it to the change in gun law . if you plot the table of homicides , you get a pretty steady negative correlation which has been declining ever since 1991 . 2009 has not been a particularly spectacular decline compared to previous years . the difference of 43 deaths a year is the 4 th largest flucuation since 1990 - not what you call insignificant . would this difference be made if more guns did equal more crime ?	0
whatever ' rubber ' was being exported probably ceased to be exported because of ravages of war during and after . did you see any spike in the price of tyres , sorry ' tires ' in the good old <allcaps> usa </allcaps> because of the vietnam war ? natural rubber by the way is used mostly in big huge tyres not the size used in automobiles . iraq was invaded to satisfy greed and ideology . american oil companies are still trying to get a preferential deal in their dealing with the iraqi government . now , what are the gringos and their lackeys ( uk , <allcaps> nato </allcaps> members et al ) doing in afghanistan , which has no oil , and no rubber ? are the gringos trying to protect and control the supply of heroin ? myabe saddam hid his wmds ( weapons of mass delusion ) in kabul or nearby ? quite amusing that you refer to westerners as gringos . the last time i heard that was in a film about pancho villa !	1
morgan spurlock , director and star of ' super size me : a film of epic proportions , ' is releasing an edited version of the film for classrooms . the school version of the academy - award nominated film is scheduled to be released after the feb . 27 oscars . personally i think that the film will be great to help solve americas obesity issues and if not convince children to not eat mcdonalds for a month parents want convenience and to pacify their children with a ' happy meal ' . most kids do not ask for lettuce , they ask for burgers . wonder why mcdonalds does not add a soy burger to their menu ? they have salads and adding soy products would be another way to show they ' care ' about health . the answer might be they have done consumer research and found the costs to create / market a new soy product outweight the profits .	1

well , if you are right then think about it : they considered millions of people inferior so they made the choice for them i imagine . so the nazis were pro - choiceemoticonxembarrassed i am still confused by this comment . did you actually mean that ? if you did , that is not pro - choice but pro - abortion . women did not have a choice in whether their pregnancies were terminated or not which , having it , is the definition of the pc point of view . so no , they were <allcaps> not </allcaps> pro - choice .	0

and the validity of your arguement here rests upon the yec reading of genesis , so it is not conclusive . is it possible to be an adult and be as clueless as you seem to be ? this was in response to the question did jesus not believe in evolution . only someone with similar mental capacity to yours would ask such a question . it seems unfair i have to answer this senseless comment you added to the nonsense .	1
it ' s funny how you intellectually - inept fools resort to talking about how i was supposedly outdebated or embarrased or whatever in other forums yet you are unable to do it here .

nice job moving the goalpost , and changing the subject also . show where in <allcaps> bcr </allcaps> ' s post which you quoted above , he said even spoke to the issue of genes ? he said no new functions have evolved in a population in which it has not existed before . and regarding your fallacious example regarding nylon eating bacteria , are you suggesting that the chemical ingredients that make nylon never existed before man combined them to create nylon ? the bacteria works on a microscopic level and could not care less what product we have made from those chemicals which it thrives on . so your example is both fallacious and moot . and the ability to digest nylon is not a new function ? <repeated> you seem to have a different conception of ' new function ' that what matches with reality .	1

would not it be nice if you did not overuse the word oppress . if you really believe that gays are oppressed then believe me you ain ' t seen nothing in the world as yet . try looking at some countries in the world and you will see what oppression really means . i am amused by how some people can look at an article of an anti - gay marriage advocate attacking a gay marriage advocate , and the person reading the article wants to focus on what qualifies as ' oppression ' and how gays could have it worse . <repeated> emoticonxdonno just out of curiousity , do you have any comment as to whether or not the attack was wrong ?	1

this is the part you are misquoting . ' it is not within judicial notice that a shotgun having a barrel of less than 18 inches in length is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense .

as do you . you seriously want to dictate to others that your opinions are the truth . i am sure you find a lot of things amusing , given your warped view on things . actually i think that what a lot of the 55 - 60% of the country who oppose gay marriage find , is that if they join an internet site , that they will be viciously attacked by gay marriage supporters . that ' s what most of you are <allcaps> really like </allcaps> . there really is not much of an anti - gay movement , except a handful of people and a few commercials . your vilification of them is typical of most far left gay marriage supporters . actually , what gay marriage proponents simply want is to be treated like every one else . denying the right to marriage because of his / her sexual orientation makes them second class citizens . the supporters of the anti - gay movement simply want to impose their moral values on to the rest of the public , the recent prop 8 ballot initiative proves it . ever read john locke or js mill ? you should , it ' s what our country ideals are based on . you have your bubble and i have mine so just leave me alone ; and the majority are never always right and should not have a say in what is moral or just based on their beliefs .	0
bingo . this is spot on . why suggest a repeal of the entirety of <allcaps> doma </allcaps> if you support the policy established by part of <allcaps> doma </allcaps> ? and i repeat my earlier observation : if <allcaps> doma </allcaps> is such a travesty , why not go ahead and try to repeal it as a senator . such a repeal would have to be initiated by congress anyway . it ' s highly unlikely that he could accomplish a repeal of <allcaps> doma </allcaps> as president . because there are still a lot of people in this country that support oppression and injustice toward gay people .	0
how about the ability to marry multiple partners ? or do you think that nothing is capable of undermining the institution of marriage ? those cultures that permit multiple wives at least do have issues as a result , but hard to say they fail miserably . we are complex animals and not all animals mate for life . there is significantly more involved in the lifelong union of humans than reproduction . multi - marry under the right circumstances works , but it is not for everybody and even for those that it is for does not mean it ' s for them always . in a nutshell marriage is the biggest commitment any person will make and should be given the consideration and thought it deserves . same sex marriage can cause a perfect union of two people the same as m / f and can make a mockery or marriage just as many m / f unions currently do . the emotional investment is the same , the responsibility and obligations are the same , the only difference is genitalia and a little more hair in some cases .	0
oh well . at least from my studying it seems that the christian worldview is not correct in any way , shape or form . but still , if anyone wants to convince me , please do . what part of the christian worldview ? a part of the christian worldview says stealing is wrong , so you must mean stealing is good ? a part of the christian worldview says rape is wrong , so you must mean rape is good ? a part of the christian worldview says sexual immorality is wrong , so you must mean sexual immorality is good ?	1

honest . what can i say ? if nothing else the bush presidency has shown us that having a president who lies every time he opens his mouth is a bad thing . she does not have enough background to say for sure . while she has instituted some conservative programs in alaska , she also championed the biggest social giveaway of any state ever . she did not even hide it . <repeated> jsut taxed the oil companies and gave the cash to the people . that is about as socialist as you get . cant say for sure on nancy pelosi . she looks like a half trained shimp next to hillary . hillary clinton may be evil , but she is smart . and bill clinton did not ? obama does not ? emoticonxdonno let me help you with that . emoticonxangel she ' s a conservative ! i will bet her upcoming debate with biden will get far more attention than mccain / obama did ! i will sure be watching ! word has it that the moderator is an obama lover . i am just surprised that so many consider it so important how one performs in these quick witted , personality contests . just because a person is slightly off the mark in wits does not mean he / she would not be a good leader - able to make sound political decisions . looks aside , pelosi ' s a dingbat compared to palin . she gets a free pass from the news media - ho hum .	1
if only she ' d been allowed to have a gun she could have what ? shot or threatened to shoot someone ? " boys and girls as young as 10 " , the story says . they threw " rocks and eggs " at her house . they do not kill you for that in england , texas maybe . actually in high school i had a friend who used to be in placement . he was sixteen years old an he said he got the s* * * beat out of him by an eight year old boy . " street kids " get their <allcaps> x <elongated> </allcaps> beat every day , pain is nothing new to them . it seems they are immune to it . it does not matter how hard you can hit , if you can not take a punch , then you can not call yourself street - worthy .	0
however , all of that is quite beside the point in the case under discussion . * * true , and the confusion was my bad , as explained already . however , the fact of revertant mutation in eusocial bacteria colonies , as demonstrated by ames and by cairns , still shoots great big holes in the darwinist assumptions arising out of your old war - horses , luria & delbruck ' 43 , and its " clone " , lederberg and lederberg ' 52 .	0
yes i believ in a young earth . however at the end of the creation week it was fully mature . i can easily see why men can say it looks old . but because your book of mythology tells you about a week of creation , you prefer that ( because it requires less thought ) to examining reality .	0

the greatest possible ( anything you can name ) can only exist in a finiteseries . as you point out , this is not the case in an infinite series such asintegers . so the definition that began this thread that god is identified as " the greatest being possible " must limit the possibilities to a finite number . as i write this i can see that it ' s self - evident - but what i can not see is howthis gets us any closer to showing that god exists ( or not ) ! this is why the title is " god exists ! <repeated> ( but he ' s not who you think he is ) . it ' s a funny proof which i do not think christians would agree this definition was god . but basically it ' s saying that take the set of all human beings . call the greatest god . god exists . not only that , but the final conclusion is one of the premises . the proof is one big circle <happy>	0

romans 2:11 you , therefore , have no excuse , you who pass judgment on someone else , for at whatever point you judge the other , you are condemning yourself , because you who pass judgment do the same things . i think that might mean that you should shut your trap about other people and not pass judgement on them ( i . e . carl sagan right here in this topic , etc . ) . what do you think ?	1

no i do not think that all life comes from a single - celled ancestor in the distant past . the first reason for this is my faith in the inherent word of god . secondly , throughout my college education ( majoring in molecular biology ) i have observed the complexities of the single - cell , and find it impossible to believe that it occurred by accident ( though that may not be the best choice of words ) . the more and more we learn about cellular structure , the more complex we find it is and how these complexities are required in order for life to be present at all . so , faith and argument from incredulity . if you find it impossible please state exactly what part is impossible . then maybe an actual scientist could take over . major in molecular biology ? not even a full degree ; not like your going to doing anything original .	1
somewhat so . if grammatically meant " with proper grammar " , then there would be no need to say " grammatically correct " . i have also heard the term " grammatically flawed " or " grammatically incorrect " both of which would not comply with the definition presented . grammatical ( adj ) means " of or relating to grammar " . grammatically ( adv ) has a similar meaning . neither is meant to definitely imply correctness . michael moore is still a piece of feces . emoticonxhoho emoticonxkill all terrorists and those who support them waxy , please read this . maybe it will help you . when you said the proper way to say it was , " . <repeated> tell me i am wrong , at least do it grammatically .

but they single out polygamists . this is a very disingenuous rebuttal of yours to steve <elongated> ' s point . it ' s like saying that we should just leave sodomy laws in place or state marriage amendments because the laws apply equally no matter what the race or creed of the gay people involved . obviously you are either completely missing steve <elongated> ' s point in using polygamists to analogize the issues here or intentionally avoiding it . i am surprised to hear you , a card - carrying christian , defending the civil rights of polygamists ! wonders will never cease ! obviously the point flew right past your noggin . gay people are discriminated against because they are gay ! but then , you folk think that ' s just fine . a few years ago , you ' d have been blowing hard about ' activist ' judges allowing interracial marriage . how dare they stand up for equal rights ! emoticonxrolleyes	1

that would most likely ( imo ) reduce the number of abortions performed . it would depend , i think , on how viable it is to transfer the embryo into the artificial womb . forced surgery would not be an option if i had anything to do about it . what if the surgery for transferring the embryo / fetus would be equal in difficulty , risk , etc . to having an abortion ? there would then be no extra physical cost incurred in keeping the embryo / fetus alive . what would be the reasons , in such a case , to keep abortion as an option ?	0

and what type of objectivist views do you have toward gay issues if i may ask ? i am assuming gay issues may seem irrelevant since they probably do not pertain to you well , cause your not gay . <repeated> there are no objective reasons to condemn gays . marriage is not a matter of state and so it is meaningless to argue whether a state should recognize it . my advocating of perfect liberty allows no contradictions or exceptions , believe me i have lost alot of support from conservatives for this , perhaps even gays if one really applied it to all extremes .	0
i can not tell if you are agreeing or disagreeing with david . david comes out against intervention in the market , and says crony capitalists want more intervention in the market . obama wants to hand out money to politically connected auto industry players . are you saying david is right , and we need less government intervention in the market , or that he is wrong , and we need the government to give more money to corporations ? a ' faux argument ' would be a pretend argument , like pretending you are an ardent pro - lifer , and making up terrible arguments , to make the pro - life position look ridiculous . kind of like a strawman except in character . proof ? and , i am just surprised that brooks is actually capable of seeing where the problem lies . his solution ? probably another dumb republican non - solution .	0
" the belief that there are approximately 20,000 gun - control laws in the united states has become received wisdom . <repeated> but as it turns out , there appears to be little basis for the number . <repeated> snipthis opinion piece was put forth by the violence policy center , the same people who opposed all forms of firearms safety training and gun locks , because they might encourage people to feel that they are more capable of safely operation a firearm . the violence policy center also pushed the idea of an " assault weapons ban " because it was easier than a handgun ban , claiming that the uneducated people are unable to tell what is a machine gun and what is not a machine gun , making passage of such a law all the easier .	0
supersport , do you believe in a creator that purposely doomed human beings to inevitable genetic destruction ? after all , if what you claim is true , human beings have no choice but to ' devolve . ' yea . <repeated> i ' d say we are on a downhill slide . do you agree with talkorigins that most mutations ( like 99% ) lose information , lose specificity ? mutations are destructive entities . they demolish and break down what was there . granted some of these may be beneficial but ulitmately the gene has lost information . and since selection works on the level of the whole organism , it cannot stop the loss of information on the molecular level . not only that , but natural selection has an i . q . of exactly zero - - as do random mutations - - so i believe the only way for the genome to go is downward . and if the only way for the genome to go is downward , then common sense says that neodarwinism is wrong . it ' s not just unlikely . <repeated> it ' s not just improbably - - it ' s dead wrong and the whole hypothesis must be rejected .	0
this is wrong . you yourself find " mental existence " to be " sacred ' in a way . there is no rational argument for mental existence being the point of obtaining rights . <repeated> no matter how hard any of us try <tong> we are legally dead when we no longer mentally exist ( hence the term " brain - dead " ) , so there is no logical reason to set the beginning point as anything other than the start of the mental existence . just as people who are dead and without mental existence do not have the ability to obtain rights , a collection of human cells without a mental existence cannot obtain rights . i also notice you have resorted to attacking other people ' s views rather than following the topic of the thread , which is to share <allcaps> your </allcaps> views . emoticonxbanghead	0
i could care less if i shower with a lesbian . i am sure i have at the gym . one of my olderst friends is a lesbian and we have seen each other naked many times . she has never gawked or hit on me . she knows i am straight . i have been hit on by women and men i am not interested in . i say ' thanks , but no thanks . ' i have only ever had one lesbian contnue after that , the number of men that would not let it rest are beyond count . but overall , i think women have a lot more tact in such matters . as to the whole naked thing . we are so puritanical about nudity in the us . when i spent a month in finland i saw people of all sizes , ages , colors and genders naked all the time due to the saunas and jumping into lakes . it was in no way sexual . as far as separating men and women ' s showers i mostly see that as a safety issue for women . sexual assualt is a very real danger for women ( 1 in 3 will experience it in her lifetime ) . although i believe most men are not rapists , especially those in uniform , having men and women shower together has the potential of putting women in a very vulnerable situation as most men are physically stronger than most women . i do not believe this . i am as worried about it as i am that stepping on a crack will break my mother ' s back . stop fretting . gay men probably find homophobes about as appealing a black woman would find a memeber of the k <elongated> . hell , i am a straight woman and find your ignorance and paranioa of the matter decidedly unattractive . neo - con , religious wing nuts . they are so entertaining . i am not interested in who is not hitting on you . do you want an ugly , flaming , gay cellulite blubber - wench hitting on you for three years or not ? <repeated> or maybe a pod of those whales all hitting on you ? <repeated> for the record , gays make normal men ' s skin crawl , and not in a good way . so keep the spiritually - challenged heathens out of the men ' s barracks , and out of their showers . just because you and the rest of the pro - gay crowd thinks that kind of depraved activity is ok does not mean the rest of society does .	1

and what did noah do about the termites ? two answers : they were either of the ant kind and did not eat wood until they underwent hyperevolution after the landing of the ark , or they were placed in a suspended state of hibernation by ' awlmighty gawd ' ( only two - one male and one female , in spite of the fact that termites do not actually propagate that way ) . it is , after all , the word of gawd , as revealed in the wholly babble .	1
regardless you still put forth a premse in your rebuttal which is not subject to either proof or disproof . or do you thnk otherwise ? your premise requires that abiogenesis is impossible and asserts the same . its highly illogical to make such a claim . oh yes i forgot there are some who believe that the property of free - will permeates the universe and is shared by all things animate or otherwise . there is a mathematical proof floating around someplace of it . but since i do not think that there is in fact such thing as free - will i have not bothered to collect it . humans do not have free - will simply because there is nothing for human will to be free of .	0
why even bother with courts ? between the nancy grace ' s of the world and several other people i have noticed , there is no longer any such thing as innocent . therefore , perhaps , we should just send anybody charged with a crime straight to jail and just save everybody a whole lot of time and money . i was for sure he was guilty . should i put my faith in a jury ? should i put my faith in our courts ? do i know better than them ? i watch tv ! of course i know better than them ! nancy grace even says he ' s guilty ! what more do we need to know ? from now on , they should just fire all the judges and lawyers and let me decide . </sarcasm> from now on , your future is in my hands ! <tong> there will be no appeals ! <tong> i am a bit surprised at the publicity this case has attracted : even here in the uk , the first item on the 10 o ' clock tv news last night was a report from outside the court house ( waiting for the verdict ) . i have never heard jackson sing and know next to nothing about his career - why has this case made such a stir in the media ? is it just a fascination with ' celebrity ' ?	0
i am only rabidly against something so obviously untrue as that of mainstream religion . my argument is that the only reason it is mainstream is that we continually perpetuate it by indoctrinating our kids with it . do you honestly believe you would have found whatever religion you prescribe to if you had not been persuaded to from an early age ? why did not you pick islam ? the only difference in christianity and islam in my mind is that islam happens to be the religion of poor states that have been oppressed by empire states . if christianity was the religion in the middle east and northern africa and the west was islamic , you would probably see suicide bombing christians . i expect i will likely get another roflmao out of you for saying this , but it is probably true . the only difference between islam and christianity is demographic . reckon you do not know much about christianity then . when you can bust the resurrection of jesus christ then you might have something to argue about . until then your claim that christianity is untrue is simply a lot of hot air .	0
i see no duplicity between the two . they are both written in the bible . neither of them have any evidence ( apart from the bible ) to support their existence . one of them has been proven to be utterly false . this naturally discredits the other , as they appear in the same publication by the same author . why decide one is true when the other is clearly not , and neither have any other supporting evidence ?	0
the crime was committed when he took possesion of the firearm . do you know of any other crimes that your are guilty of when your are innocent in the past then the law makes you guilty later for a past event ? if the speed limit is 40 mph on monday , the law makes it 30 mph on tuesday , are you guilty of speeding when it was monday ? well in the uk you are . 23,000 firearms were handed in when the uk had its gun ban . according to your logic those people that handed in their firearms can still be prosecuted because they took possession of a firearm prior to the ban . i do not think so .	0

" a week before that , the <allcaps> cia </allcaps> fired missiles remotely from a predator aircraft into the waziristan tribal area . they were hoping to eradicate a bunch of al qaeda operatives . instead , they killed 18 women and children . one week before that , i arrived in pakistan to visit darra adamkhel , the massive open - air market located deep in the tribal areas , where a frighteningly high percentage of islamic holy warriors goes to buy their guns . gaining access to the tribal areas was next to impossible . it took months of pre - planning with the consul general of pakistan in montreal and top officials in peshawar . they repeatedly denied us entry because , according to them , the pakistani army had too many " sensitive operations " going on in that region . without my personal advantage ( a family friendship with the governor of the northwest frontier province ) , we never would have gotten in . the government assigned me and my team a political agent named naeem afridi . he was born and raised in the tribal areas . he took care of us while we were there , and he was a godsend . you can not do anything in this part of the world without someone like naeem . our driver stopped at a security point just outside the town center , where we were introduced to the frontier agency militia , six angry - dad - looking guys with aks and sidearms . they became our personal bodyguards , and followed us through the tight warren of gun shops and factories , barren little brick rooms where upward of 1,000 guns are manufactured every day . most of the work is done by hand . the vendors are pashtuns , who are basically the toughest people in the world . they comprised the majority of the mujahideen who kicked the soviets out of afghanistan in the late ' 8 0 s . these days , the town is rumored to be completely overrun by the taliban . they purchase the guns , then cross the border to fight the u.s. army in afghanistan , or they drive through the mountains to the south to fight the pakistani army . this summer , i went back to pakistan , and found that the fuse on this powder keg has become even shorter . the pakistani army has surged more troops into the tribal areas , attempting to eradicate the taliban and al qaeda . the u.s. and british troops are attempting to do the same thing on the other side of the border in afghanistan . meanwhile , pakistan itself has seen violence spread to its major urban centers , where extremists have been detonating bombs and taking over police stations . but at the same time , there is a cultural explosion taking place , a vibrant art scene and metal and rock bands popping up everywhere . the whole situation has become ultra charged by the fact that there are tons of news channels operating uncensored by the insanely corrupt government . for pakistan , it ' s a volatile , turbulent , and fascinating moment in time . so . <repeated> what was all that bull * * * * about terrorists exploiting america ' s " weak gun control laws " in order to amass arsenals of deadly weapons ? it seems to me that they do not need undercover operatives to come to america , forge documents and undergo background checks just to get civilian weapons . they have got their own arms manufacturing plants over there , they can make whatever they need or want .	0
of course , if you get a muslim in here making similar claims to the claims that christianity makes , you will get an equal reaction from the same people who critize christianity ( for the exact same reasons ) but people start threads here all the time against christianity regardless of whether someone claims something here about it or not . it ' s prejudice , pure and simple , and you are no exception . now , one would think , being the supposedly non - christian enlightened person you are , you would simply say " oh , i did not realize that my posts came across as anti - christian sometimes , and that it indicates a prejudice on my part , and will try to not have prejudices in my thinking . " i mean , one would think those of you are do this sort of thing would be happy that someone had pointed out the obvious prejudice going on , as it would be a case to help you move away from prejudicial thinking .	0
the reason his sentiments confirm the worst fears of creationists is not because lewontin alone has those sentiments , it ' s because creationists can clearly see those sentiments in the ny times editorial board , <allcaps> cnn </allcaps> , <allcaps> abc </allcaps> , dan rather , handgun control , the sie so everyone thinks that " evolutionists " should seize power or something ? if that is true , it is because evolution is very widely accepted .	0
so , in one thread you are whining because he pays a lower tax rate than his secretary , but in this thread you are gloating because the legislation he suggested to fix that got shot down ? you are a strange , strange man . wrong again daewoo ; but at least you are painfully consistent . i am merely pointing out the hypocrisy and level of ignorance obama displays every time he opens his economically clueless and divisive mouth . but then , who would ever accuse you of getting anything right ? once again , the buffet rule is for the gullible and clueless to glom onto in a vacuum of reality and the fact that it would do nothing to solve this nations problems and is merely a diversion from the massive failure this president has been , more so than even carter . i cant say i am surprised you would glom onto such an idiot talking point . it is only strange for someone who is so completely clueless that they cannot even comprehend a simple thread premise . so were you born this clueless , or deliberately play the role of someone who is patently clueless ?	1
incidentally , is the title of this forum meant to imply that creationism and intelligent design are two names for the same thing ? while i agree that they are more similar to each other than to evolution , it troubles me that anyone would believe that they are synonymous . for those that think the title is justified , what about the two beliefs do you find similar enough to class them as the same idea ? because of the history of it . well , id is actually identical to ' scientific creationism ' , but spruced up with more scientific terminology to attempt to pass ' seperation of church and state ' . let us just say that i.d. is an attempt to teach creationism in school .	0
no benefits for laid - off religious workers - upi . com another example of religion getting special perks that they should not have . and unfortunately , somebody else gets bit in the end . i find it difficult to believe that the religious organizations did not realize they were not paying unemployment tax . emoticonxrolleyes when they were busy not paying taxes , did they think that was a tax that they were somehow paying ? it sounds like at least some religious organizations recognize the impact of their not paying taxes upon others , and take the responsible route to ensure that they as employers do right by their employees ( e . g . catholic diocese of richmond ) . these people should not have to needlessly suffer such an unexpected financial loss , but in the end it ' s the church that is to blame . they have been enjoying a benefit in not having to pay this tax , and now it ' s somebody else who suffers . <repeated> i am very surprised to learn that religious institutions are exempt from the normal taxation associated with having employees .	0
pectable congressman with derogatory and homophobic insults . easyrider , you truly are a man of god . let us see now . <repeated> you are christophobic , biblephobic , fundie - phobic , steeped in carnal hedonism , you use derogatory rhetoric against god ' s people , and what else ? hypocrite ! <repeated> and barney franks a respectable congressman ? <allcaps> rotflol </allcaps> ! <repeated> you are clueless , shooter . i shutter to think where you will wind up . but we will have to see what develops . it ' ll probably be negative , since you have lost your focus .	1
clearly variation within species is possible and has been observed , such as poodles and great danes , but they remain members of the same species . and what would make them separate species ? how about wolves and dogs , separate species ? how about great danes and chihuahuas ? they cannot interbreed under any circumstances ( even artificially - the fetus is not viable ) .	0
anyhow , i have no problems with the archaeopteryx . it was an interesting creature , but simply having features present from two different forms ( bird and dinosaur ) does not mean it is a link ? yes , you do have a problem with archaeopteryx . you can not explain it from a creationist point of view . i am not claiming that it is a " link , " whatever that may be . it is a transitional form . it is a small theropod dinosaur that has characteristics that are common to theropod dinosaurs and only theropod dinosaurs and their ancestors . it also has characteristics that exist in birds and only birds . some characteristics exist in both . the furcula , for example . a furcula has been identified in some theropods , but it is rather rare and then only imprefectly preserved . an indication that it may be mostly connective tissue . archaeopteryx has a furcula . but even at that it does not compare to the same structure in birds . it is intermediate . imagine that !	0
i remember one woman who was in her 7 th month of pregnancy , and she was taken to the emergency room of the hospital where i worked . all of a sudden she went into v - fib ( ventricular fibrillation ) , which causes an arrhythmia ( erratic head beat , more commonly known as cardic arrest . she was quickly transferred to the trauma centre , where i worked to take the baby thru caersarian section . i worked with 4 other m.d. ' s trying to save both lives , and our work was valiant , to say the least . sadly , we lost both the mother , and the child , no matter the heroics we used . i go to bed many a night , and i still see that lady ' s picture , and the stress she was in . of course anyone can cite exceptions . <repeated> did you see the baby ? probably not . <repeated> as long as the mother is ok the baby does not count . <repeated> emoticonxrolleyes	1
the dino would be to heavy to glide or fly with them if they were not fully developed , and even then only a few yards could be gained when jumping off a hill , ect , and when not fully ready . the would hinder the dino by hunting , by giving it a larger profile , and something else to get wounded for no benefits in return . the fact that they were too heavy , is simply untrue , see previous post . hunting depends on many ecological factors , such as their predational preference . also new fossils suggest a trees down development of bird flight so fully developed flight muscles and feathers were not necessary .	0
i do not believe in any gods , but thankyou for assuming anyone who disagrees with your ridiculous assertions about proving gods non - existance must be a theist . just like creationists assume anyone who disagrees with creationism must be an atheist . you are just as bad as them , and your arguments , if you could call them that , just as short on substance . so why are you here ? do you have anything to offer of any substance ?	0
you can stop with the word games , you know very well what i am talking about . but i will clarify . <repeated> congress has the power to declare war . <repeated> but congress cannot make war . <repeated> you are implying that congress can go into session and just vote for a declaration of war without the president being involved . it may give them this power under the constitution but the constitution is vague at best and in the absence of a clear directive they normally follow the precedent that was set by the first declaration of war . <repeated> and since every single time we have issued a declaration of war the president of the u . s . initiated it that is the precedent we follow . and let me add . <repeated> the president can veto a declaration of war as well . i am not playing word games . you said congress does not have the power to declare war ; how else am i supposed to read that ? you meant congress does not run the war . <repeated> you clarified , end of story .	0
you can have all sorts of discussion about pain etc . you can come up with useful ways of helping people cope . however when you fully understand and aspect of pain in terms of nerve impulses and how your fancy painkiller stops them that is a better result . so restricting yourself to what you can measure can have results and should not be dismissed as " bad because all restrictions are bad " . then should not your challenge be re - worded to say " what might be the best . <repeated> " because at present we are not at a stage where by we know everything about ' pain ' therefore in the current climate , rather than what might be known down the track , i think i have met the majority of your challenge . after - all , you are insisting now on what ' you can measure ' , and we can not measure all that there is about pain , at present .	0
and nobody has ever managed to do so ( though the concept of an invisible man in the sky is a little silly ) . but it , along with the uranian tapeworm hypothesis , is just as valid as intellegent design as a hypothesis . actually , the uranian tapeworm hypothesis , . as far fetched as it may be , is more testable than a supernatural designer . i think maybe the kids <allcaps> should </allcaps> be taught intellegent design as an example of pseudo - science . hopefully they will see why it is not science and why evolutionary theory is .	0
yes , you are 100% right ; but the moment i say otherwise , vor chastises me for not being catholic - enough . vor is about as catholic as the archbishop of cantebury . i am curious about what i am right about though , seeing as i asked you whether you think that medically un - necessary abortions should be legal or not .	1
they accept donations , however . if these donations exceed the cost of hosting a website ( pretty inexpensive ) , where does the money go ? ' legitimate rapture notification service ' seems like a contradiction in terms . as pt barnum ( apocryphally ) said . <repeated> only you would consider accepting donations equivalent to charging a fee moose . as if the two are at all similar . after all , one is a mandatory charge , while the other is an optional donation . and i am not going to defend the rapture at all , but do not you think it ' s a bit premature to assume it will never happen ?	1
no , a valid general definition of evolution would be ' descent with modification . ' keep that stupid ' complex ' or ' better ' x <elongated> out of it , because those terms do not mean anything . tell that to all the theistic evolutionists . how many times have i used that word in this post ? once , and only to clarify your mistaken definition . the asa has a faith statement , a bit like that of aig or icr , that pretty effectively shows how mistaken you are . my purpose behind posting the link was merely to counter the ridiculous claim that evolution is necessarily atheistic . the asa faith statement above supports my position . if something is modified , does it not become better , or more complex ? there ' s nothing wrong with those terms , unless you are a degreed scientist who is talking down to common peasants . all . 00001% of them ? you are not the only one i debate . emoticonxidea does talkorigins have one ? they are used as a reference here constantly - i do not think the asa has been referred to a single time , until now . talkorigins feedback section supports my position .	1
of course , no one expects that you would have made any effort to actually educate yourself before you accepted creationist dogma from someone else who is as ignorant as you . there have been several continuing experiments with anole lizards in the caribbean . i will leave it to you to search the peer reviewed literature for the several papers on the topic . i am sure that it will not be a problem for you , given your constant quest for knowledge . it ' s worse than that , pandion . for example , here ' s what i told him over at <allcaps> arn </allcaps> on the same subject back on april 5th . <url>	0
nope , you have still missed the point . bolding your repetition will not help , either . you said ' all visiting moslems ' . not ' all visiting individuals ' . specifically investigating ' all visiting moslems ' is discriminatory . investigating ' all visiting individuals ' is not - well , it is a bit , but less so - and you would not have got this response if you had suggested as such . since we are at war with radical islam and they have attacked our homeland once already and have promised a repeat performance . it is ludicrous , irresponsible and suicidal to consider that investigating people of islamic descent before allowing them entry to be a discriminatory policy . especially since terrorists do not fight like men but are committed only to hit and die / run sneak attacks . but i am not surprised that you are blinded by political correctness when you should be concerned about your families security . emoticonxrolleyes	1
<allcaps> wow </allcaps> , in one fell swoop you completely destroyed my faith in god . in 109 words you awakened me from 32 <allcaps> years </allcaps> of religious delusions . <allcaps> not </allcaps> ! <repeated> i can understand your disappointment . its very difficult to cure someone of chronic religious delusions . no easy way to relieve the suffering of the victim . but if you really work hard at it for another decade or so you may recover yet . best of luck and do not fall for the quacks peddling quick cures .	1
i am not clutching or crowing . i am simply pleased everytime i hear that another atheist has changed his / her mind about the existence of a supreme being . you were crowing a bit . what i do not understand is why . how could you possibly be pleased by some strangers religious views . would you have been pleased if he switched to liking broccoli ?

you are really going to hurt for that statement . <allcaps> where are your stats backing that up </allcaps> ? ! <repeated> <url> jfriday : in fairness , no one , pro or ant - gun can ever use uk stats to support thier argument again . back in jan '03 the uk government finally came clean and announced that they had been seriously fu**ing <censored> with crime statistics . you can make the argument that the uk state had something to hide with guncontrol and you would probably be right . reliable information from uk ministries should now be accepted as less than credible .	0

every person should attempt to preserve what they hold dear . if the atheist is a objectivst who loves the ideal of freedom and capatalism then they will probably support a battle against the terrorists . if the atheist is a communist , he may not really care if america is destroyed . ( i only mentioned objectivst and communist as examples i am aware that their are other forms of atheism and i do not need to be informed of this . i am also aware that not all communists are atheists . ) what do you mean ' the civil rights of terrorists ' . i have not heard any atheists or non atheists suggest such a thing . knowing more than just a little about my fte compadres , and those that i know personally , they would fight along beside me and i them to preserve our freedoms . to go as far to bow down ? when they have taken what smidgen of life is left in me . but in direct answer to your post , jim : they are doing so as we speak .	1
question no . 3 is very different than no . 1 . you suggested an affirmative to any of the three would result in the loss of one ' s <allcaps> ccw </allcaps> . i do not buy that . i suggested nothing . you are reading into this some thing that is absent .

' what is missing from public consciousness is that the rulings of the courts starting with parker in 2007 are devastating defeats for the gun rights core doctrine that the purpose of those gun in private hands , outside of the knowledge and reach of a governing authority , is to maintain an anarchic balance of power between a privately armed populace and any and all government . the political leadership to carry those rulings forward does not exist . ' second amendment , gun control , the potowmack institute i am a bit confused . it seems like the supreme court has taken a much more moderate position on the issue than people like you typically advocate . perhaps you could clarify . what gun laws do you support ? oh no you did not ! not g earnst website ? oh yes you did ! that would be like me quoting from nato ' s website . po tow mack institute emoticonxsmilie potomac river humm .	1

the technology is here . we built a prototype of a weapon a while back ( mil contract ) that was constructed entirely from carbon composites . it is more or less the same stuff that they make the carbon barrels for the 10 - 22 with . i do not think they will be hot sellers , though , as they need specialised molding systems ( single use ) and the composites required for the stressed parts is very expensive . the prototype cost 3.4 million to build , with an estimated per unit cost , whould they ever reach production , of $347,000 each . boy $346,000 ? i can think of a few $300,000 firearms in existance today . if anyone of them every shot and killed a person , boy it would be so <elongated> easy to trace it down . so then why bother banning them ? using a $300,000 gun to shoot someone is like hit and run in a bright red ferrari in a busy intersection , the cops are going to find you .	1

great , if artificial wombs become avaliable then women can get zygote transplants rather then abortions , but the question for me is ' do zygotes have a right to life ? ' why does mere biology automatically = right to life ? if this were the case than non - humans that are biological alive should also have the right to life . no your question is not about ' right to life ' , but more appropriate your questioned should be ' do they have a right to continue life ' ? and my answer is absolutely yes ! at the living single cell , when the unique properties of a complete human being is created , it is living , not dead . who has a right to kill another human being ' s living existance ? no one has that right in a civil society , but we have not reached that society yet , but one day maybe .	0

for me the reason i do not ' give it credit ' is that it ' s irrelevant - - i do not see how it matter either way way if sexual ' orientation ' is natural or not . it ' s a separate issue from the moral one . remember , it ' s natural for animals to do many things - - some species ' males impregnate the females and leave forever the female to raise the offsrping on it ' s own . but just because such behavior exists among animals does not make it moral in humans . in fact i ' d call it immoral . there are many such examples in the animal kingdom . natural does not mean it ' s automatically moral . then you would want me to be something god did not create me to be ? silly , i ' d say ! humans are part of the animal kingdom . mammals if i remember from biology . are you not an animal ? if not , maybe the mothership will come and pick you up soon .	1

common sense says that if we are all on a downhill slide that mutation / selection – being the conservative / degenerative devicees that they are - - could have never have explained the origin of anything . our genomes could not have arisen spontaneously . instead , our genomes were designed by a designer . you believe two things that are incorrect : that you have refuted evolutionary theory , and that we will now accept intellegent design because of your attempt .	0
that ' s really simplified . it ' s not like a woman ' s body is a suitcase and the fetus is biologically self - reliant . it lives off her life processes - her blood , her immune system , her calories - it puts stress on her joints , muscles , heart , and bladder . pregnacy can demand major sacrifices in behavior and diet - some of which can be detrimental . no a baby is not the woman ' s body - but a pregnancy is . ha wouldnt you say someone who is really overweight actually has more of a problem with stress on their joints , muscels , heart , and bladder than a woman carrying a small child in her womb ? obesity can demand major scarifices in behavior and diet . some of which can be detrimental . i really dont see your point because this isnt just a woman ' s problem when it comes to these issues you pointed out . and im not really sure what a " pregnancy " is according to you . <repeated> please explain . <repeated> when i hear the word pregnant , i think of 2 people , not just 1 . also , the baby has its own blood , its own immune system , and contains its own calories once consumed . theres nothing that the mother has that the baby doesnt other than it just needs nutrtion . just like you need food everyday .	0

a human life is only a person once there is someone existing there . before a fetus has a mental existence , it is just a growing human body - a thing , not a person . a thing cannot suffer , cannot feel pain , fear or even feel anything for that matter . how can you have empathy for a thing ? once a fetus develops a mental existence , then it is a person worthy of protection , as are all people . in that case a man in a coma is not a person then , is he ?	1

somewhat so . if grammatically meant " with proper grammar " , then there would be no need to say " grammatically correct " . i have also heard the term " grammatically flawed " or " grammatically incorrect " both of which would not comply with the definition presented . grammatical ( adj ) means " of or relating to grammar " . grammatically ( adv ) has a similar meaning . neither is meant to definitely imply correctness . michael moore is still a piece of feces . emoticonxhoho emoticonxkill all terrorists and those who support them waxy , please read this . maybe it will help you . when you said the proper way to say it was , " . <repeated> tell me i am wrong , at least do it grammatically .

then you misunderstood what i said . because i posted the whole link which referred to itself as the flavium testimonium . somehow i seriously doubt that " testimonium flavianum itself " meant " from the website by peter kirby entitled ' testimonium flavianum ' that happens to have the text of josephus ' an 20.9 . 1 .

even though florida ' s mckay voucher program was specifically created for students with disabilities , the law is structured in a way that penalizes middle - and low - income parents who cannot afford to pay tuition or fees that typically exceed the voucher ' s face value . additionally , participating private schools are not required to offer special education services and even those that do offer these services are not required — unlike public schools — to monitor students ' progress . 147 crouching libertarian , hidden cost . can not pay extra expenditures get ' s ya penalized ! no special education requirements ( they are ' t unders state or federal control ! ) no requirement to moniter student progress . <repeated> that seems safe .	1

in class i have to debate why if we were to start a new country why it should be socialistic . i do not want this to turn into a debate , i only wants links and reasons on why we should go socialistic over capitalistic . thanks for helping . * <allcaps> reminder </allcaps> * please do not turn this into a debate ! socialism is a very broad category of political ideals , which particular form were you thinking of ? and just so you know , fascism is not a form of socialism in any way . socialism does not have oppressive governments . the purpose of socialism is to remove the class differences in society , if there is a small group of bureaucrats enforcing their will on the workers then that ' s a class difference .	0
no , your idea about science is a philiosophy of science . sure , it ' s got a lot of believers , but historically it is not the only vision of science people have believed in . there is metaphysical evidence . the apostles saw jesus walk on water . there was no ' measure ' by your version of science , but what they saw remains true . people have entertained and will always continue to entertain beliefs in all manner of propositions . many people once believed that the earth is flat : perhaps some still do . but this has nothing to do with scientific truth . there is no " version " of science that one chooses from a menu of possibilities . by definition , scientific enquiry arrives at hypotheses after gathering evidence from observations and experiment . any law , knowledge , etc . thatis arrived at by scientific method is open to modification or falsification if new evidence comes to light that must be taken into account . all science in this sense is provisional . the apostles may have believed that jesus walked on water : that does notmake it true .	0
no , you are spreading false information . people interested in the truth try to avoid this . those given to emotional rhetoric do not mind one bit if it suits their agenda . just like the brady campaign . often when trying to paint concealed carry holders as dangerous individuals , most instances they cite either never had a concealed carry permit to begin with , or the matters of the case were instances that lacked mens - rea and were not crimes to begin with .	0

but if he intervenes , then the events will have changed and were therefore not foreknown after all . the whole issue of foreknowledge would be moot at that point , and freedom of choice would no longer be there . i think people sometimes make the idea of forknowledge more complicated than it needs to be by getting into paradox and blame issues . it basically means that god knows what ' s going to happen before it happens . but he does not intervene in order to maintain humankind ' s freedom of choice . foreknowledge is not the same concept as predeterminism . that is an utter contradiction . he knows what is going to happen , but wants to preserve our freedom of choice ? what freedom ? please , explain so i can understand , this ' freedom ' which gives rise to only one possible future ! the existence of a god who can see the future implies we have no choice in shaping our destiny . no ifs , buts or maybes . this is not about god deciding our future , it ' s about whether we can . well , that ' s one interpretation . another would be ' not sticking our heads in the sand ' .	1

apparently you have got one powerful set of rose colored glassed . i guess you spend a lot of money on those 1 - 900 psychics too . <sad> nowhere is it scientifically inaccurate ? are you serious ? waxy yup . give me an example of a true inaccuracy , instead of working to poke fun . do you honestly think anyone will take you seriously ( except the evolutionists ) if you do not provide reasons for your apparent problem with scriptures . are you scared because you see the " ancients " commenting on subjects you thought science had " discovered " since the " enlightenment " ? man , how arrogant can you get ? you remind me of the pharasees . arrogant presuppositions are no substitue for confronting your ignorance my friend . either explain how the bible speaks accurately on sophisticated subjects as given above , or do not bother posting .	1
no , it has not , despite what you and your girlfriend say . and , whether it supports my <allcaps> pov </allcaps> , as i believe it does , is not the point . the point is that my <allcaps> pov </allcaps> is valid , scientific , and becoming increasingly accepted , while your darwinist boat , riddled with leaks and worm holes from day one , is finally being allowed to sink to the bottom without further plugging up and bailing out well actually i have not seen your point of view expressed anywhere but on these forums . seems to me if its rising to ascendancy at least <allcaps> one </allcaps> scientist somewhere would have recently at least mentioned it . quick search reveals no mentions at all . of course if you say its displacing <allcaps> nds </allcaps> then i guess i will have to agree - you being a well known biologist and all , but i remain perhaps a bit irrationaly skeptical .	1

and once again you have only your twisted opinion and nothing to support it . <repeated> 1 ) why is the philosophy of jefferson twisted ? <repeated> if you can not say its because you are a typical anti american liberal . 2 ) nothing to suppoprt it ? if anti - american liberal positions were made illegal as per the constitution then everyone would have to vote among the conservatives . the political spectrum would simple shift so that both extremes were in the intelligent range . on the far left you ' d have romney and on the far right you ' d have ron paul . now that would be an intelligent election consistent with our very very conservative constitution .	1
i think your question should be ' why did god make commandments ? ' because that ' s what ' thou shalt not kill , thou shalt not covet ' are ? and no , commandments are not designed to help you live happily and without fear . its actually the exact opposite : commandments serve the purpose of keeping people under control through the use of fear . sin means diobeying the commandments . as for homosexuality and witchcraft , they are sins because there are commandments against them . i think you are missing the point . why would you want to keep people under control ? to prevent them from harming other people . the men who created the commandments and the bible i believe had good intentions . they wanted to give people a reason to live their lives well , and the bible was the best and most intelligent thinking of the time ( not modern , ancient ) . it was a good idea , however people started looking past the ' love thy neighbor ' stuff and started focusing on unimportant things like homosexuality and abortion . so , my question is why is homosexuality a sin ?	0
<allcaps> note </allcaps> : when i say beneficial mutations , i am not talking about a gain of new genetic information to the genome . the organism can survive in the environment by a loss of genetic information i . e . the loss of a function , for example the loss of wings of a beatle on a windy island helps it to survive . if they had wings , they may be blown into the ocean and drown . over time , you may get a population of wingless beatles - the adaption would be mutation by natural selection . not evolution . which also fits beautifully with the creation account . wow , make up your mind . either populations change over time ( evolve ) or they do not . would your wingless beetles be able to produce wings again if they were somehow beneficial again ? you are starting to sound like darwin and his finches .	1

i do believe that the predictions are accurate , but i say ' no ' for two reasons : one , stopping the event would create a paradox . since the event is stopped , it never happens . if it never happened , then nostradamus never predicted it . the second reason is , in the prediction that correlated to 9 - 11 , skeptics asked why they could not stop the incendent . along with point one , i say to them ' how do you know that somebody did not go to authorities on 9-10-01 , and say ' there ' s gonna be a terrorist attack tomorrow ' ' ? if someone cited a cryptic writing dating back centuries as evidence , they would either be laughed at and dismissed , or sent to a mental hospital . edit : sorry about forgetting the poll . i remembered that just as i hit the submit button . i am half asleep today . . <repeated> and half right . preventing something that has been predicted does not create a paradox . your logic is severely flawed here . i am somewhat surprised by that . if i predict that georgia tech will win the peach bowl and lsu comes up and prevents that , i still predicted it . i was just wrong . you are attaching something supernatural to nostradamus as if he really had some power to accurately predict the future . he made some lucky guesses . <repeated> that ' s all . sometimes , the local fortune cookies are right , too . sometimes the horoscopes seem to fit . that does not mean that the writer ' s actually knew anything about their future readers .	0

this makes no sense . bet does not exist to be exclusive entertainment for blacks . it is ethno - centric programming . and not very good at that ( tv1 is better ) . for there to be a ' white ' channel , at least along the lines of what bet is aiming to do , there would have to be a single ' white ' culture , which there is not . and bet does not exclude whites from its programming . your statement seems flat out racist to me . as i said previously , ' tookie ' s ' defenders seem to be overzealous in their defense of the man ( i can only take your word for it since i really have not been paying much attention ) , but i do not see how their accusations have anything to do with hate crimes , and your perceptions of how they are enforced . you have to be kidding me . you do not really believe this , do you ? <repeated> sure they may have white people on from time to time , but obviously they exclude white people since you can turn it on and almost always see only black people . so the criteria of whether something is racist or not is whether or not there is a ' single culture ' behind it ? i do not see why having a culture behind it is really relevant . things can be racist or not independent of whether there is a culture there .	0

i agree , but when you know your opponent will succeed in making you look weak if you give them the chance , trying to look like the bigger man will do jack for you . i know i am the bigger man , the only reason for publicly displaying my moral high roadedness on an internet forum is to prove myself , but if i know my opponent will use it as leverage against me then there ' s really no point . on an internet forum why is that so important ? the bigger man usually need not find it necessary to prove he is , but is secure in his knowledge he is or is big enough to realize when he is not and adjust accordingly . my guess is this is not the only place this happens . these things happen , you fall , you get up , people laugh , you move on , you see someone fall you can laugh or help them up . just depends on who you want to be . sorry i am a sucker for empty milk crates . can not seem to walk by one without jumping on and taking her for a spin .	0

there is nothing about the theory of evolution that precludes a god . that fabricated idea is absurd . there is nothing about the theory of relativity , nor the theory of gravity , nor the theory that the earth is round that precludes the existence of a creator god . in reality , god may or may not exist . some people believe god exists . others do not believe god exists . neither view can be proven based on physical evidence . both are beliefs only . though one of those beliefs must necessarily be true . i did not say that evolution precludes god , all i am saying is that many atheists seem to think it does , and thus it likely contributes to the number of people who beleive there is no god . if a person does not beleive in god , then they must beleive there is no ultimate morality .	0

o . k . , lets go through your scenario . the government has been toppled and the standing army has been crushed . somehow all americas nuclear arms were obliterated . the invading force has successfully instituted a dictatorship and is now systematically destroying our personal freedoms . now suppose the year is 1799 and the population rises up . the five rounds with 200 million guns , works . the population overthroughs the invading army through sheer numbers , though the price is high in terms of casualties . america is once again free and the democratic system is once again put in place . the year is 2004 , the population is no longer fit and tough from working in the fields to get their own food . but each of the 400 million people has a gun , with lets say 30 rounds each . the population now has 12 billion rounds , and lets assume each round is an armour piercing bullet with long range capabilities , and lets also assume for the hell of it , that each gun is a machine gun with long - range single shot abilities and a scope ( just for fun ) . same situation , same invading force . the population rises up , taking along with them the few remaining rockets and bombs from the few remaining weapons caches . lets say 2 million hand - held anti - plane missiles , 4 million anti - tank missiles and for even more fun , lets say they have a genius military leader who has somehow the ability to maintain instant contact with any unit anywhere , and is the greatest tactical mind the planet has ever know . to overthrough the standing american army the invading force must have had massive numbers of planes , tanks and naval units . first off , 4 million anti - tank weapons is not much when put against 400 million people , so you have a lot of venerable areas . where ever the militia units try to form , they are killed by tanks , even though many of the tanks with infantry backing are destroyed the army keeps going because to over through america who has the greatest tanks in the world , you would have to have like 10 - 1 ratio on the american armed divisions . but , wait . lets assume somehow the ground forces of well - organized troops and tanks is defeated by the population . lets assume the invading army again somehow lost all its ground units , lets pretend the enemy forces had exactly 4 million tanks , and the ratio of shot - to - kill was perfect . to defeat the american army of planes you would , again , have to have massive numbers ( or technology superior planes ) . so the population tries shooting down the planes , but the planes would usually get away because modern planes can take out a ground - based target with out ever going closer the a couple miles . but again , wait . somehow , without losing so many troops as not to be able to defeat the massive mechanized occupying force , all planes are spotted ( miles away ) and shoot down by the <allcaps> untrained </allcaps> militia . the genius military leaders ( who no body though to kill ) work no doubt . yet still , the population is defeated because if i remember correctly , the militia does not have naval units . so even if all the inland forces could be killed , the majority of costal forces would be protected by barrages from the enemy naval force ( which is very large because it had to defeat the american navy , the greatest in the world technologically ) . but lets assume , the population just swims to the invading ships , kills the crews , and uses the ships they stole to kill the other enemy ships . thank god for that tactical genius at the helm of the american resistance . i am actually guessing that invading force must be like 20 times bigger then america ' s armies for one simple reason . the only way you could defeat the american icbms is to have a blitzkrieg ( i know my spelling sucks ) like attack . most of the <allcaps> icbm </allcaps> silos are not connected to the internet , mainly because the government knows the silos would be venerable to internet attack , so any rebuttal involving the virus - like disabling of the nuclear stockpile is gone . now , you may be wondering what am i trying to say here . well its simple , if somehow , just somehow , the entire military force of the u.s. was obliterated , it would take just one <allcaps> icbm </allcaps> hit on the enemy ' s capital city to make attack impossible . again , the blitzkrieg like attack ? even if that worked the u.s. , like russia and a few other nuclear powers , keeps stockpiles of nuclear weapons hidden underground in the invent of being taken over , and the underground stockpiles usually have several rockets with enough range to blast the heck out of the closest invading army . so it would never happen that the u.s. would be left nuclear - naked . but lets assume that happened ( maybe during a really , <allcaps> really </allcaps> cool party some idiot colonel peed on them , and they just fried ) . the genius military commander did somehow take out the entire invading force of air , ground and sea . you still have to deal with the fact that whoever invaded the u.s. probably spend several trillion doing it ( i know , that ' s a pretty low number for the invasion of america ) , and in that case most likely have satellites and long - range missiles ( again lets assume somehow america ' s own just fell out of the sky and the invading force got even guys together to be able to take out all america ' s nuclear silos including the underground stockpiles which each have own guard forces of soldiers training night and day for such an event ) . the hugest , most glaring problem with the militia , unless every one the 400 million militia units somehow got a radio and a laptop , they would have to gather . and if they gathered in the numbers they would need to gather in , to order to defeat the large invading army , they would be taken out very easily by 1 . icbms launched from enemy subs 2 . prominent meetings between our military genius and his supporters stopped by snipers with a 1.5 mile range and superb training and intelligence ( remember those satellites ) 3 . all groups preparing for " battle " so to speak could be taken out as they are marching or driving or whatever by mortars , ambushes , rockets , infantry rushes , tank columns etc . before they knew what hit them . 4 . it would take a lot of planning to get 400 million people to fight , and assuming everybody has a laptop with wireless capability , they would still need satellites for the military genius in california to command units in n.y. , n.y. , and . <repeated> wait america ' s satellites are gone and if the invading force could do that , it would not be that hard to take out commercial internet satellites in geoscyhronize orbit ( effectively sitting ducks ) . and any land based networks would be destroyed in the first few hours of insurrection . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - but militia units only have guns , and they would get their butts whooped , even with massive numbers . what you are saying is only true about napoleonic tactics , in today ' s modern warfare almost completely infantry - based armies are obsolete and very venerable no the afghan war is not a valid counterpoint , the terrain was different , the people are more hardened , the weapons were supplied by a military power superior to the russians , the afghans had unlimited anti - tank reserves , had incredibly extensive cave networks in which to hide , plan and attack , only had to defeat , on the majority , other infantry battalions because of the terrain in which armoured vehicles could not cross , the russians were under funded and their moral low , the soviets had already been beaten down by large amounts of smaller fights across the cracking soviet empire , china needed to be supplied with more troops as it started to look toward independence , afghanistan is nowhere near water eliminated the possibility of naval back - up by the very crappy russian naval forces , the afghans received help from the rest of the arab world which would not happen with the u.s. because if an enemy can take out the u.s. , it could probably take out the combined forces of europe and north america , and , finally , the afgans did not have nukes so they had to defend themselves with their own two hands , but america has nukes and if ever anything tryed to do what is in the above senario they would get blasted because unlike the russians in afganhistan , the americans would be defended their homeland . neither is the french revolution a good - counter point , as i have said , your tactics only work with napoleonic - style battles and guess what kind of battle were happening when napoleon the 3 rd was in power ? ( in case you did not learn it in school , napoleon the 3 rd , napoleon ' s nephew , was in power during the french revolution ) trust me , cause the only thing i love more then physics is military tactics and warfare . - - - - as i have shown in more detail , treat2 is right , it would not work . - - - - - - the other amendments do not pertain to retaining the sovereignty of the u.s.a , they pertain to the basic rights each citizen enjoys and therefore will always be important and " in fashion " so long as the u.s. still has human citizens . please opinions only , not baseless assumptions using limited military knowledge , or rebuttals to previous opinions . so , in your opinion , are you saying that this invading force that you are talking about , would never bat an eye as to whether the people of the <allcaps> usa </allcaps> are armed to the teeth or not in their pre - war planning ? surely any country that tried to overtake the <allcaps> usa </allcaps> would suffer severe damage to its military in all aspects . and even if it succeeded , it would still have to deal with our armed citizens . are you trying to tell me that this is not a ditterent ? sure , if you dream up some <allcaps> darth vader </allcaps> size invasion , no one stands a chance . but if you put it real world perspective . say , 2 or 3 of the bigger countries got together and decided to over take the <allcaps> usa </allcaps> . i would assume " armed citizens " would be a major factor in deciding whether to invade or not .	0
if i was to ask a religious person of a provable way that he found out about his belief he would have to say that he was told . if the person that told him was asked the same thing he would have to say the same answer . now of course it can go back wards like that for ever , it has to go back to three “ possible ” beginnings : some one lied , some one was insane / delusional / ect , or there was divine intervention / ect . actually , the answer might depend more on the nature of the question , or the particular religious cult of the person being asked , etc . in questions of science , fundamentalists will tell you that the answer was revealed to them by their god in their holy scripture . on the other hand , you are characterizing religion as insanity . i think that you really mean that when religion is offered as science , then that is insane .	0

now we come to the problem with the " theory " of intelligent design . there simply has been no thinking involved . the equivalent of id is doing all the experiments with the apple , measuring the mass of the apple and the earth , and figuring out gravity , publishing it , and the public supporting that hypothesis with their experiments , with no refutations or flaws , and then some people coming along and saying , " well maybe magic fairies caused the apple to fall just the way it does , ever think of that ? we should teach them that this is a valid alternative to gravity . " i also offer you this for humor : <url> that ' s <allcaps> not </allcaps> the equivalent of id - you are mixing causes & effects . the theory of evolution , and the theory of intelligent design would equally observe , measure , and publish the effects of the apple falling . then the evolutionists would say that happenstance origins caused gravity to work that way , and id proponents would say that a supernatural design caused gravity to work that way . students should not have it implied to them that happenstance origins are the only possible cause of gravitational behavior . your " apple falling " scenario is a simple one - the original cause of gravity has practically no impact on how we observe and deal with it ' s effects . other scientific subjects are not that simple .	0

great , and typically dishonest of you to post about the opinion of an episcopal church which is pro gay and one of the most liberal in souther california : all saints episcopal church is an episcopal church in pasadena , california . it is widely claimed to be one of southern california ' s largest and most liberal churches , and is the largest episcopal parish west of the mississippi . it belongs to the episcopal diocese of los angeles . all saints is known to support gays and lesbians , opposes the death penalty , opposes the iraq war , and supports anti - war activist cindy sheehan . can you find a bible believing church that agrees with them ? all saints episcopal church ( pasadena , california ) - wikipedia , the free encyclopedia oh no an open minded church that does not hate ? <allcaps> gasp </allcaps> ! and sorry but the bible has many interpretations as is clearly seen in the <allcaps> wide </allcaps> and <allcaps> vast </allcaps> amount of differing denominations . just because their not closes binded right wing bigots does not mean you can grill them cause their interpretation is different . <repeated>	1

oh man . you keep ignoring the <allcaps> historical context </allcaps> of the issue . back in 1967 , " societal views of marriage " meant <allcaps> same race marriage only </allcaps> , by an overwhelming majority that supercedes that seen today against gay marriage . by a margin of 3 to 1 , people <allcaps> disapproved </allcaps> of interracial marriage . society " viewed " marriage as " between a man and a woman of the same race " . back in 1967 , societal view of marriage was opposite - sex . wait . <repeated> it ' s <allcaps> still </allcaps> that way .

the quality of life ethic is far different from sactity / dignity of life ethic . a quality of life ethic carried out to its logical conclusions does not promote a pro - life society . instead , there would be genocide against the handicapped , elderly , and people who people of power have deemed life unworthy of life . the problem with this ethic is that it is centered in arbritrary people deciding arbritarily which person passes the " quality of life " test . the interesting thing about the ' quality of life ethic ' is that , in a pro - choice framework , it means that we can not degrade anyone ' s quality of life without their permission . so far from entailing a cull of the elderly , the infirm , the handicapped , and the ugly , the quality of life ethic entails that we cannot kill them off . each person is entitled to the quality of life that they desire where what they desire does not infringe on other ' s quality of life .	0

well , as we all know he has been and he is gone . surprised he had the guts to come and support what appears to be a lost cause . even if martha ( or as teddy ' s son patrick calls her marcia ) wins a close race , there is a message for obama and the democrats , " stop shoving things down our throat " . maybe that is the way it is done in chicago or some third world country run by a dictator . yep , martha is in trouble and the democrats are panicking . i think the strong independent support for her opponent is due to martha ' s own lack of appeal . by they way , i have to ask . <repeated> since " the anointed one " was in your neck of the woods , did you get a peek at him ? prehaps even wave at him ( with all 4 fingers ) <wink>	1

i do not know if you read the last part of my post , but i will repeat it more clearly . a baby is always reliant and demanding of another person ' s care . a baby outside of the womb still depends on its mother ( or somebody at least ) to consistently keep him fed , to help him sleep and to change his diapers . a baby can stay alive for a bare minimum of time outside the womb , but it still needs care . viable may not be the right word for you . maybe i should say as ' genuine ' a baby as the newborn . and you are correct when you said : ' ' the probability is progressively less with each fewer number of weeks . ' but that only makes sense when the womb is empty . when the womb is occupied , it is occupied with a living functioning baby . functioning ? the fetus breathes freely ? it cries when it is hungry or uncomfortable ? it demands attention ? it smiles and coos and is cute to those who behold it ? wow ! did not know that fetuses were that active and functional .	1

i have read the opinions and conclusions reached in several internet entries and i can see how they would largely persuade someone to think that the side - by - side dinosaur and human prints in stone do not exist . however , before you reach a personal conclusion , i would really recommend you visiting the site . awe is not strong enough to describe the feeling that overcomes you when you personally witness this . i have been there and felt the chill when i saw what could only be prints of very old humans co - existing with dinosaurs . there is hardly a rebuttal that works when one is personally exposed to such an odd and even eerie site . the heel marks are clear as are the arches and in many instances , the toes . before the naysayers offer a rebuttal , i think a visit to the paluxy river around glenrose might be in order . when you do , i think you will agree that there really is nothing like it . you might even revise your opinions regarding order and origins of life . sounds pretty neat . i have never been there but i will keep it in mind for a road trip some time . so you are of the belief that dinosaurs and man lived at the same time ? i know that there are people who believe in this but i do not come across them very often . so what information do you have to share with us about this idea ?	0
an alternative ( shorter ! ) wording of the statement , taking into account the greater context of the constitution , would be " a ( human ) zygote is a person " . as hinted by the title , the general context of this thread is how the statement relates to the rights of a zygote ; we may end up branching out into that area , but the statement is the starting point . please note that i added the word " human " to your comment above <allcaps> iangb </allcaps> . after all it is not my claim that all zygotes are human beings / " persons . " agree ? also , i want to make it clear that i am arguing only for the most basic of human rights ( life ) and not for the full panopoly of rights that say an adult human individual would have .	0
i can see your point , though i am confused about gay sex drive , your saying a gay man ' s sex drive is not feminine ? is it reasonable for a heterosexual to want to avoid close contact with a homosexual under certain conditions ? like being naked for example ? there are gays that go to my gym , am i being homophobic if i purposely avoid showering with him ? i can surely pick my friends ; naturally my interests would hardly mirror a homosexuals interests . some are even quite feminine and would hardly be interested in the same subjects as me . is it reasonable for me to be selective about whom my friends can be ? well , since we are talking about a gay man , i would guess it would most likely be masculine . yeah , you are being kinda homophobic . why would you possibly care if a gay man sees you in the shower ? they are not going to do anything to you . if you treat someone differently for no reason other then the fact that they are gay , that ' s homophobia . gays are just like everyone else , excpect they are sexually attracted to the same gender . their interests cover the same spectrum as yours , sex aside . they are just as likely to be masculine or feminine as a straight man . gays are , in everyway outside of sexual preference , just like straights . so while you can certainly be selective about who your friends are , if you write someone off just for being gay that would be a shame , and a sign of prejudice .	0

you did not mind commenting about god ( ' the lord ' s prophets ' ) just before i wrote my question above to you , so why are you running scared or bugging out now ? looks to me like you could not answer the question . so where ' s the beef ? answer the question ? tell me how god creates mankind with free will but at the same time does not allow man to sin ? you know my answer : there is no god and no one " created " mankind . but the discussion over the existence of god belongs rightly under " religious " or " philosophy " section , not abortion . is this one of the tactics you fundies frequently practice ? change the subject when you are about to lose ?	1
yeah , i know . <repeated> like many religions , people just claim they are one and then think they can just pick and choose what to follow . to me , you are all or nothing so those that think the pope is an idiot should probably consider a new faith because they do not believe in the one they say they do . so , you are saying that you believe in absolutely everything your church believes and you support everything it does and the moment it did anything oustide of these you ' d leave right ?	0
nslation : the government will tell the citizens what kind of bank account they need to get to save up for their own health costs - - then pay it yourself . we constantly hear that a major reason for the increase in health care costs is the cost of the uninsured . how does it help it tell low - income / unemployed / minimum wage workers to save their money ? once again , businesses will love this . do not offer health insurance to employees - they are self insured . or they can get it themselves through their church ? ! <repeated> maybe you are having trouble with the concept of " low premium , high deductible " . that means the monthly payments ( premiums ) are low , and the deductible is higher ( cost you actually pay for services ) . this should not be a problem . how often do you actually use your health insurance ? i use mine very rarely ( not at all in the last year ) . it appears that what bush is trying to do is get insurance coverage to low income folks without a multi trillion dollar price tag ( like kerrys plan carries ) . this is not a bad thing , and i am not even a bush supporter .	0

for me , this is like the idea that the speed of light was once very fast and has now slowed down . both ideas indirectly call god a liar . this is bad . actually , this ( if what that article is true , which i am not quite sure ) is a healthy part of science . old theories are disgarded and new ones come in as more evidence is brought to bare . every theory made by fallible man is prone to being disproven and destroyed . man ' s theories change everyday , while god ' s word has remained the same .	0

he believes also that the genealogy between adam and noah allows for an accurate accounting of the years between the two events . his main point to me was that although we know that the bible does not give a complete genealogical record , where it does , it is reliable . and that is what i have been saying all along too . i am not questioning what the bible <allcaps> does say </allcaps> . i am questioning <allcaps> what it doesn </allcaps> ' <allcaps> t say </allcaps> . but for the time being , until i can support what bothers me about dating the creation of the world using genealogies , then i must concede that this record from adam to the flood is as accurate a record as is possibly available at this time according to the bible . please tell me , why did you believe your pastor , but not me ? what did he say that was so convincing ? and please , <allcaps> please </allcaps> , tell me what you think the bible might not be saying that could have any bearing on this in the slightest . how can the fact that we do not know ehosh ' s second cousin twice removed have any bearing on this at all , or whatever you think the bible wasn ' t saying ?	1
by far most speech about homosexuality from those who do not approve is not hate speech . you have been listening to too much propaganda from gay lobby groups who think demonizing and working toward persecuting christians for their beliefs is the best means to an end . if canada limited it ' s persecution only to those who are trying to change the law , there would not be a problem . you misunderstand me i believe they should all be locked up . anyone who preaches against gay people freely living their lives as equal citizens with all the rights and responsibilites should be locked up in the darkest dungeon . there can be no compromise on this issue peoples lives are at stake .	0

how so ? do you mean to treat others , better than you would have others treat you ? then you are merely a perpetual victim to sociopaths . people are not always following the golden rule , and that ' s where the social unrest and problems start . without some degree of this a society cannot function and there would be no social cohesion and there would be constant conflict without peace . why does it serve them to do so ? it ' s because we are social . it ' s mutual self - interest , sure , but the larger human need to interact with the other is always there . no one is an island . no one is completely selfless either . we preserve ourselves , so we may realize our full potential by some degree of social interaction and co - operation . so ? anyone can be a victim of sociopaths , no matter what their version of the golden rule . making one vulnerable or not , it ' s still a ' nicer ' form of the ethic . what makes ' social cohesion ' is peoples ' desire for self - preservation , not compassion for others . that ' s not the golden rule , it ' s just the understanding that people are better off if they get along with others . it ' s sort of like the ' mutually - assured - destruction ' doctrine of the cold war .	0

also , the old testament is a testament of history and prophesy while the new testament is a history of the life of jesus , the stories he told , and the letters written to churches about him . comparing the history of noah to a parable of jesus is faulty logic . and mythology . you forgot mythology . for example , the two stories of creation were probably two popular folk myths . and the story of the flood is actually two versions of the myth that are intermixed . and , of course , the stories of job and of jonah are pure mythology . do you know what logic is ? comparing the moral mythology of noah to a parable is an analogy , not logic . the myths of noah are not history . and since we are talking about noah , i see you bailed on the thread where the pyramids of egypt were being discussed . and yet you refer to this obvious myth as history .	1
there is an intrinsic , inherent item of biological evolution that <allcaps> isn </allcaps> ' t scientifically valid and that could well be responsible over time for the eugenic - mess we have seen over the years . evolutionary theory itself preaches and teaches no - teleology - no - conscious - forethought . the process of evolution has no scientifically known teleology and follows no known predestined plan . it does not teach that there cannot be any such things as teleology or forethought . this is where your mistake lies .	0
you have avoided this whole conversation . i do not even know where this point came from . is the question will education and contraception help reduce teen pregnancy ? yeah , it does . does it make teens more responsible to have sex ? no . pay attention . age of consent is still the topic and point . if teen pregnancy is reduced to statistically acceptable levels through education and contraception with medical risk being a negligible five - decimal point factor , that would position teen sex emotional distress as a good / bad societal interpretation designated by non - teens , would it not ? which would negate chronological age of consent for legal sex to a non - status unless those non - teens making the laws had another agenda .	0
some people attempt to explain unknown causes in nature by god ' s direct intervention . this has been called , " the god of the gaps . " while god could certainly intervene in the natural process ( called a miracle ) , to make god responsible for common natural phenomena means that as each scientific discovery finds a natural explanation of what was previously attributed to god , the direct intervention of god becomes unnecessary . that is , as the gaps in knowledge become smaller , the god of these gaps becomes correspondingly smaller . people with this mentality see science as a threat to their faith . obviously , were such a view held by the founders of modern science , there would have been no incentive to find answers to the natural phenomena . understanding these natural phenomena as secondary causes , places god above them where increased ability to explain how they occur not only does not " decrease " god , but adds wonder to his creation . " <url> and depending on what human is " finding the answers " it can unfortunately cheapen and deny many central biblical teachings .	0

that ' s an interesting subject , i had not heard of that b4 . did our bodies once produce vitamin c ? . <repeated> yep . but our ancestors lived in an area of abundant fruit , and we got all we needed from our diets , so it was no big thing when the gene broke . a few non - primate organisms also have it broken , but it ' s broken in a different way . barbarian observes : it ' s remarkable then , how much progress we have made . you may or may not approve of the theory , but it works very well at learning more about biology .	0
just because people have all sorts of views on the subject does not mean that there is not a right answer . well it all depends on who is going to determine " right " , is not it ? abortion is not math . there are no finite answers . just a myriad of opinions which inevitable lead to either abortion is right or abortion is wrong . no different now then when roe v wade became law or any other times in history . i do like aristotle ' s take ; he taught that a fetus originally had a vegetable soul but he did not say what kind of vegetable .	0
what ' s the scoop here ? it seems to me with all the shootings that occur in the united states because of all the gun happy nuts running around , everyone would know how to do first aid at the site of a shooting . i understand bullet wounds are kind of nasty because they are deep . there ' s also the massive loss of blood ; to be sure , the massive bleeding would wash out nasty debris but a body can not stand to lose a bunch of blood . where were you when we discussed this twice previously ? nice slur , good way to show your false ' compassion ' emoticonxcry depends where it hits . two to the center and one to the head is the accepted protocol . i posted dr . fackler ' s , the leading authority on ' wounds ' , previously . did you miss it and the miami dade shooting events ? scroll back dearie .	1

so where did we come from ? how did all of the matter in the universe propel outward ? is this one of millions of universes that never cease to start , expand , contract , end and then start again ? you cannot answer every question with science . a role for philosophy exists in this world . so you have gone from evolution and id to cosmology . you have a real problem with maintaining established realms . id addresses evolutionary theory , not abiogenesis , and not cosmology .	0
then surely you can not explain away why enzyme a and co - enzyme b are separate compounds but work together to produce another by - product . well , in the case above , it was step - by - step . first , an existing enzyme was modified to a new use , and over time , became refined to work better and better . this is the way evolution works . nothing is de novo ; it ' s always a modfication of something else . second , a mutation produced a regulator that only allowed the enzyme to be produced if the substrate was available . again , this was refined by natural selection over time . in the end , the newly - evolved system was irreducibly complex , because all three parts have to be present for the system to work . and do show us your numbers proving that such processes can not produce new information . if you do not know how , i ' d be pleased to show you how a mutation changes the information in a population .	0
this is the root of the problem with the entire insurance based medical system . it is affordable and obtainable for those who do not actually need it , but impossible to get or unaffordable if you can . this is the heart of the debate . a lot of people find it morally unacceptable to let somebody with a treatable condition die in the richest country in the world for lack of care . at the same time in order for insurers to stay profitable , they need to not pay for treatment for people with expensive conditions . and how does this differ from life insurance or car insurance ? or for credit cards , for that matter ? the cost of a policy , or card , is proportional to the risk assumed by the insurer . do not want to pay high premiums , take the risk on yourself . period . i find it morally unacceptable to steal money from people in order to satiate another ' s morality . we have no god - given right to live forever as far as i know .	0

hey everyone im new to the whole creation vs evolution thing . i do not really know where i stand but i have a question . being new is not a problem . nor is uncertainty about a position . the way to learn is to ask questions in appropriate places . however , a problem with message boards is that , without experience , it may be difficult to tell who is speaking from knowledge and who is speaking from ignorance or faith .	0
i tell you now , a fetus is not morally a person to me . there , you are refuted . and what if it is one to me ? then your refute is equally refuted . the support for us not knowing lies in you and other ' s inability to provide anything beyond speculation as support for the assertion that an unborn child is not a person . your own inability is my support .	0

both thompson and mcdonagh treat the child — the woman ' s own daughter or son - - like an invading stranger intent on doing harm . they make the mother / child union into a host / predator relationship . a child is not an invader , though , a parasite living off his mother . a mother ' s womb is the baby ' s natural environment . eileen mcdonagh wants us to believe that the child growing inside of a woman is trespassing . one trespasses when he ' s not in his rightful place , but a baby developing in the womb belongs there . the argument that the baby is not a parasite , but is rather ' in its natural environment ' seems a false dichotomy : it is natural for a parasite to be in the enviroment of another ' s body , invading it . the relationship element will be dealt with in the third section .	0

and here is what you get when the government gets a hold of it . premature baby ' left to die ' by doctors after mother gives birth just two days before 22 - week care limit | mail online where is the government in this ? clinicians made a clinical decision , and hid behind a non - mandatory guideline , which was set by other more senior clinicians , expert in their field . assuming the woman ' s very detailed recall of the stressful series of events is accurate , perhaps it was god ' s way of telling this unmarried mother that after five previous miscarriages , she still wasn ' t getting the message .	1

unfair to paint all fundamentalist christians with such a broad brush . those making this absurd claim of foreign birth are likely uncomfortable with their president having an arabic name and maybe his african heritage as well . i am surprised archangel has not jumped on this . he ' s gullible enough to fall for tv props , why not this ?	1

i think you have berezovsky in mind . the british refusal to return boris berezovsky to russia , is because he has been granted refugee status on the grounds that he has good reasons to fear persecution on political grounds in his home state . james . persecution on political grounds ? we are talking about a kingpin of russian organized crime here . he has been indicted in russia for fraud and political corruption ( bribing politicians ) and there is absolutly no question that he is guilty as sin . now he is hiding in britain and actively planning a violent coup in order to overthrow the elected government . <repeated> and he lays all this out to a british newspaper . political persecution if he returns ? probably not . execution for treason ? that one seems more likely . in the extradition rhetoric arena , the russians are looking a lot more reasonable then the british .	0

the reason simones threads turn to yobama is because she is attacking rick warren as if he is responsible for anything the ugandan government does . simones link attempts to link warren to this legislation because of his relationship with a ugandan pastor , but according to this newsweek article , warren broke ranks with this pastor back in 07 precisely because of these attitudes and opinions of his . and notice the date of this article , it is very current . pastor rick warren responds to proposed antigay ugandan legislation - the human condition blog - newsweek . com does not surprise me lets all jump ship and put our heads in the sand . <repeated> even more of a reason i should run for public office <tong>	1
your attitude is wrong . instead of using your mind and energies to disprove the bible you should use all your power to to learn how to obey the teachings of the son of god and mature emotionally and in wisdom . the ' teachings ' either have no substance , or are certainly not original . demonstrate categorically just who is the son of god , and why this figure commands worship and obeisance .	0
people have raised scientists to undeserved heights . it is clear that scientists can affect their experiments and observations , even in spite of their best efforts . right . and that is the reason for peer review . creationists do not subject their ramblings to peer review . that is why so much care is devoted to the proper construction of experiments to test the hypotheses by real scientists . creationists just invent ad hoc stories without any experimentation .	0
diogenes raises a good point , and this applies to all aspects of national security as well . during the clinton administration , reno ' s justice department and tennet ' s cia treated terrorism as a criminal act , which it is not . a war does not have to be between countries to be a war . how exactly is terrorism not a criminal act ? i do not see what you are getting at .	0
i agree . these laws limiting magazine capacity are based on stupid assumptions that are based on hollywood ( think drive by hollywood ) . the average shooting involves less than 5 rounds fired . so limiting the capacity has no affect on crime . well , i have heard people on the pro - gun side say that most defensive gun uses do not involve firing even one round . so limiting the capacity would probably have less of an effect on the ability to defend yourself than on crime . so why are people from the gun lobby always whining about restrictions like this ? when semi - automatic rifles were banned in australia , hunters welcomed the law . they saw it as a challenge because it takes greater skill to shoot an animal with a bolt action rifle . not so in america where some gun owners like to use guns that could take down planes to shoot small animals .	0
we are far from jw ' s in that we do not deny the deity of jesus christ or the trinity . we are christian through and through . i am not really willing to give up info on me . the website would be just a bit too close to home for me . i will cut and paste our essentials from the website though . proving my beliefs from the bible is not being un - christian . is it ? as i said i do not want to debate it with you , i just like to know who i am typing to . simple .	0

yes , i certainly did consider these risks , and the risks at the time were far higher for continuing pregnancy than getting an abortion . then for you , you made the right decision at the time . i ' d personally have been leary of not getting to work or go to school easily from the doctors statements , especially in regards to keeping the child .	0
ask yourself this smiley , who gets life without parole ? mass muderers , first degree killers , pre meditated murderers , multiple offense rapist / killers , child abducter / rapist / murderers and convicted 3 strike violent felons . are you telling me that brutally violent repeat offenders who get off on causing human misery deserve the comforts of home as punishment for commiting these heinous crimes ? you see , i firmly believe that men can commit such terrible crimes that they forfeit their rights to breathe our air any longer . but short of the death sentance , then yes , life without parole should be hard and no fun whatsoever , and i mean ever . you are right , why not simply kill these people in the shortest amount of time possible . i got it ! we can advertise each killing ( hanging , rock slaying , guillotine , etc . ) weeks in advance , kinda like moves , and show it on pay - per - view . you can buy tickets to watch the show live as well . i mean c ' mon , if we are going to have the death penalty we might as well utilize in the most gruesome , cost efficient , and swift method possible . right ? that is how punishment was executed a few centuries ago . honestly , how you feel is how a lot of people culturally conceive such offenders . in regards to the death penalty debate , it falls along a continuum between morality and scientific reasoning .	1

how should i respond to coming back after some time to be immediately called chisler , con artist , stupid ? nevermind my observation that left to your own devices , days go by where you either follow up your own posts or pat each other on the back as you regurtitate canned anti - gun control rhetoric . i calls them as i sees them . you might recall that initially you pro - gun guys rejected even the suugestion that american semi - autos would be of any interest to the cartels when they could get full autos on the black market . how then do you attribute the fact that 70% of the rifles seized in reynoso last november , the biggest single seizure to date , traced to the us ? that ' s why i posted that story . that ' s my question for you guys . apparently they have some use for semi - autos afterall . i love how you are pro - choice until its a choice you do not like . let people carry guns in their own home . let them carry it on their person . it has nothing to do with you does it not ? unless you deal with people threatening you with guns on a daily basis it does not . their house <annoyed> = their choice , her body = her choice ? i love hypocrisy .	1

keep the timeframe in mind . do you believe that our school systems are worse than education 1000 years ago ? by the way , could you post a link to a study ? i ' d like to take a look at one . also , we appear to have differing views on what logic and intelligence are . why do not we pick one ? or debate both views . <repeated> actually , it is just science . out of curiosity , why do not you debate the big bang as much as you debate evolution ? is not it as much of a threat to fundam - sorry , u . s .

what bothers me the most about ' organized religion ' is the sheer hypocracy . i was taught that god instructs us to question authority , yet ' the church ' brainwashes it ' s mass followers to not ever question authority , especially theirs . i was taught that to not utilize the brain i was given was the unspoken sin of all sins . yet organized religion forces it ' s followers to do just that , to not question authority , pooh - pooh science , and never think for themselves let alone following their hearts . i cannot of good conciense as a parent allow my child to be subjected to that type of abuse . spiritual abuse , abuse of the soul . how dare anyone expect me to do that to an innocent child ? how dare anyone allow this to continually happen , even encourage it ' s existence is beyond compassionate comprehension . but the fact that it does is not shocking , it ' s just sickening . you are right justine . organized religion has always been used by some people as crutch in order to feel superior to others . why use your brain and heart if you do not have to ? because they are encouraged by their particular religion to behave this way , they think it ' s ' morally ' alright . ' sickening ' is a good way to put it .	1
it ' s a step toward legal same - sex marriage in another jurisdiction . as it becomes legal in more areas , an amendment will be more difficult . well let us see . . . the last time a state started recognizing gay marriages , suddenly there was more support for a federal marriage amendment than ever , democrats lost more seats in congress , the minority democratic leader was defeated after years in office , a protestant presidential candidate carried the catholic vote against a catholic candidate , evangelicals in the country were energized , the pro - <allcaps> fma </allcaps> candidate <allcaps> won </allcaps> re - election even though his approval rating was 50% , and the state that recognized gay marriage fell under a slew of legal challenges to the point where it ' s up in the air again . the more you push you agenda through activist judges , the closer you get to the people having to pass an amendment . at least new york was smart enough not to do it right before an election .	0
interesting that those three are also the weakest and rarest of arguments when arguing for gun control . in fact , i have never witnessed anyone basing their entire gun control argument on the fact that ' gun owners lack the testicular fortitude to fight someone in hand - to - hand combat .

you claim that the distinction between a baby being a bodily function of a woman or not is a matter of “ empirical fact ” , this is just not so . i think you should rethink what “ empirical fact ” is . empirical fact , are facts that are said to be true on the basis of empirical observation . if i see a light on in a room , that is an empirical observation , and for me , that the light is on , is an empirical fact . however , if you and i both empirically observe at a fetus in a womb then the only empirical fact we could both agree on , i think , is that there is indeed a fetus in a womb . i say that fetus is part of a persons body performing a function , you say its something else , and that ' s a mater if ideology , not mere observation . so for example if i say " you are a part of my body , and therefore i have a right to kill you " , is this simply a matter of ideology ? i admit the distinction is not clearcut at early stages of development , but how do you support the idea that post - birth children are " a part " of their mothers ' bodies and therefore legitimate to kill ? it is no more legitimate to say that a fetus is a part of a woman ' s body than it is to say that a woman is a part of a fetus ' body . just as a woman is not a subordinate slave to the fetus within her , the fetus cannot be considered subordinate in rights to the woman it is inside .	0

the criminalization of abortion was the real abuse of power . it was mostly done by a few sexist and political oppertunist members of the <allcaps> ama </allcaps> to stop women from practicing medicine and by xenophobic / racist protestant groups who feared a non - white / non - protestant majority here in america after the civil war cleared out many of them . so the intent hiding behind abortion laws all along was to keep women in the gutter . there was not any legititamte concern for the unborn fetus . it was all about how they could keep women down . tell me then , would someone who supports a ban on partial birth abortion do so simply because they want to repress women ?	0
i said a few posts up that i do not think that people are actually offended . it ' s strictly a seperation of church and state issue . incorrect . check out my post above from 7 - 19 to see the legal issues . in particular , the government may not take any action whos primary effect is to advance or endorse religion and ' the constitution forbids not only state practices that ' aid one religion . <repeated> or prefer one religion over another , ' but also those practices that ' aid all religions ' and thus endorse or prefer religion over nonreligion ' . you guys just do not get it do you ? this is not about an attack on christianity . this is not about anti - christians , and in the end , this is not about the cross , or any other religious symbol for that matter , offending anyone . this is about keeping religion from meddling with government , but just as , if not more , important , it is about keeping government from meddling with religion , and the moment they intertwine , there are possibilities for many dangerous things to happen . and by the way , i am a christian , and i do not want my government in any way defining any part of what i hold dear . p . s . sandycane - most buddhists are not in india .	0

do you think mr . bledsoe would have wound up dead if the perps had been carrying baseball bats and he had said , youre not going to hit me with that thing ? nothing less than a gun will work when you guys want to defend yourselves , but all weapons are equally deadly in the hands of another . you do not see a contradiction there ? i do not see why not . if somebody is perfectly willing to murder you in cold blood despite your blind compliance i see no reason to believe that they ' d hesitate if it meant crushing a skull with a bat rather than just shooting them in the face . seriously , what kind of stability are you dealing with when all it takes to motivate someone to murder is a simple question ? a baseball bat is not concealable like a handgun , is it ? nor can it be readily used by someone suffering arthritis or used in a cramped location . any weapon can be used to inflict death and murder . the human body is hardly a modern marvel of resiliency and near - indestructibility . even sneezing wrong can be potentially fatal . certainly not . do you see a contradiction ?	1

considering you left - wingers have been wearing out lawyers for the last 100 years trying to get all the vestiges of christianity erased from our halls of government , our history books , etc . , america must have been more of a christian nation than you will ever admit . no easyridden . <repeated> it ' s you right wing fundies who have attempted for years to rewrite history to fit your religion into our constitution . america is a nation which has always had a population of christians , but it was never a christian nation . the words god , jebus , holy spirit . <repeated> are <allcaps> not </allcaps> included in any of the founding documents . you can continue to ignore the history , you are the one looking like a buffoon .	1
i do not place an objective value on all human life . most people , when they are truly honest about it , do not . i know if i had to choose between my pet dog and a person i have never met , i would choose my dog . similarly , other peoples babies hold no sentimental value for me . i just do not care about them . so would you care if abortion were outlawed . if so , what would be bad about allowing a view that places objective value in human life to be the basis for making law ?	0
what are the choices of the so called ' pro - choice ' people ? to ban or not to ban abortion , and clearly they had made their choice . even to them the word ' abortion ' is hard to speak for they know abortion is killing , so drop the euphemism . because i call a spade a spade that makes me a woman hater and basher ? sister , sister now , lets examine the anti - prohibition of abortion case ( at least you didnt call it pro - choice ) . i have never said that the defenders of the right to abortion want every woman to have an abortion . so please dont put words in my mouth and what are the choices of the so called ' pro - life ' people ? suffer through a rape or incest induced pregnancy , die from pregnancy complications without a chance of terminating it , or force women who took proper precautions which failed to go through an unwanted pregnancy while likely losing her job , scholarships , any chance at life , etc . some great choices there emoticonxrolleyes i ' d swear the whole group of them have an underlying misogynistic syndrome .	1
but what i really relish above all else is how much stock you skeptics put into defending a non - substantiated q theory for which there is zero historical evidence while at the same time trashing the historical gospels for which there is a great deal of evidence ! how about you post all the " great amount " of evidence concerning the gospel mythology . the fact that you do not even bother to read the actual information and form an argument tells me you have nothing . <repeated>	1
in this case the law and the science are in accord . the law can treat the late term fetus as a person because it has developed to the point where sentience is verifiable . let us say that the law , based upon some kind of verifiable scientific data , decides that some folks are inferior to other folks , and thus less of a person ? you know , if the law said ' because you are black , you are less of a person than shomeone who is white . you should not be upset though , all scientific data suggests that you , because you are black , are truly inferior to those who are white .

you might criticize me for believing evolution happened simply because scientists say it did , but alas , thats the reason why . anyway . <repeated> no . unless you wish to actually undertake the study of the relevant science , that ' s what you need to do . creationists do the same thing . the problem is that creationists tend to accept the word of those who are not any more educated than they are . thus , a creationist will accept hovind ' s dust on the moon argument or his shrinking sun argument as " proof " of a young earth .	0

i completely agree with this here . we need to teach kids how to think , and unfortunately , id does not seem to deal with thinking . but it really does deal with thinking . it can invite a more wide open scientific investigation of ecological and developmental patterns . it ' s not politically afraid to pursue facts about newly discovered complexities of life which pose problems for those trying to make a case for happenstance origins . it invites thought , not suppression , of irreducible complexity , another problem for happenstance origins .	0

i have actually read quite a few wsj articles on the internet . they are seldom high quality , and a few have been really bad . i remember one particular article about swedish economic and political situation during the 9 0 ies . there where so many factual errors it was almost embarassing . obviously i do not have a perfect memory or even that i read what you are referring to . why do not you give me a flavor of their ' factual errors ? ' and are you talking about their news sections or their opinion pieces ? and who wrote it ? sometimes in the opinion pieces these are submitted by authors in the nations that are the subject . perhaps this was written by a swedish politician who had an ax to grind .	0
dude you need to realize this : if the claims i make are true , which i believe they are , then that means all the most crazy , outlandish , extreme conspiracies , are true . this is why society would have such a hard time believing it is real . not because they dont want to travel interdimensionally , but because it would mean believing in what those ' crazy nutjobs ' believe in , do you realize this ? all conspiracies are tied in to hide this one fact . conspiracy theorists never look that far back , but when you start looking that far back , it makes alot more sense . this has nothing to do with my post . you do not need to believe in conspiracy theories to believe that the universe is pretty crazy . i am an advocate of science , and even i admit that , especially at the quantum level , shit gets crazy . particles being in two places at once , 95% of the universe being undetectable , whole separate universes colliding to make new ones . it ' s crazy yes , but it is also scientific . in fact , compared to science , the answers psychics provide are rather boring . i am impressed by the stuff i just listed , not some charlatan guessing whether or not i have a dog .	0

well it seems that you basically lie , if you want to come to that basic conclusion . your link went to the second page of a thread . i requested a quote and a post # for the yec = christianity claim . you failed to provide that on this thread . you did not provide 6 different posts . you really do show a lot of arrogance and subjectivity that because you view 6 different posts as being evidence of something , that that makes it automatically true . you are basically saying that your spin is the truth and anyone who does not see things the way you do is dishonest . a perspective that is both arrogant and foolish . actually if you read the link you posted , you will see that the author is not just a christian who is neutral on yec , but he tends to favor creationism . lol . says the one who did not even bother to open the specific post link . huh . again , you do not care about evidence . i gave it to you and you said i never did despite the link to the specific post right there . liar you call me ? well , i guess it takes one to know one . questionable . all that the author did was state that the evidence rejects yec . he does not argue for another form of creationism . please stop trying to argue there is only one form of creationism . my god you are dishonest . still avoiding why arch would replace yec with christanity eh ? apparently you think interchangeability means that the words mean two different things despite being used interchangeably as the same .	1

there is no logic in your argument at all . for starters , what you recommend flies in the face of the first ammendment . ah but freedom of speech has many limitations . since liberals are opposed to american principles their speech can be considered treasonous . no country can survive if it allows itself to be undermined . lincoln went all out to preserve the country , we should do the same things by making liberals illegal .	1

it ' s called a technical correction , and if you had any knowledge about these things you would know this . all commodities and equities have gone up substantially over the last year and a correction was in order . oil broke through a 5 year old resistance line a while back and that usually means that the price is going down even further . i expect oil to be heading towards the mid 40 ' s before going up again after the <allcaps> opec </allcaps> production cut at the end of the month . and if you think that inflation has no effect on the price of oil or any other commodity / stock , then you are either ignorant , stupid or both . inflation affects the price of everything on this planet . nice try , but no cigar . i never said that inflation had no effect . of course it does . but even factoring in the alleged 500% inflation since the 1 9 6 0 s or whatever it happens to be depending on calculation does not account for the huge run - up in the price of crude to nearly $80 not that long ago . my beef has been the resident " experts " here who flout their supposed knowledge and money to impress us lesser mortals who reminded them of the iron law of supply and demand . that , by the way , is found in economics 101 . but you knew that , did not you ? so now , it ' s a " technical " correction . what ' s next ? some wisdom from joe granville or the elliot wave theory ? ball in your court .	1

well heck , if lifeforms cannot realistically be strung together by small , gradual , materialist increments ( which they can not and there is no evidence for ) then the only alternative is special creation . so much for your cover . its blown . you just made another gaps argument making the assumption that if theory x does not explain observation y that a theory which is untested and untestable <allcaps> must </allcaps> be the only alternative explanation . balderdash and shame on you . the alternative theories would likely be numerous and the <allcaps> only </allcaps> one is not something untested and untestable . but i forgive you <allcaps> god </allcaps> probably made you make the error for his own mysterious reasons . or else your statement is evil and was forced upon you by the devil . maybe you will never know - in this life at least <sad>	0
the problem with your statement is that freedom of religion is specificly enumerated in the bill of rights . government recognition of marriage is not . as i have told mathew s on numerous occasions , you are free to put forth an initative , in your state , to ban government recognition of opposite sex marriages or all marriages . you are also free to vote your opinion on such initatives , but so is everyone else . marriage is not a religious institution . it is a government contract nothing more . many people choose to have a religious ceremony to celebrate their marriage but that doesnt make it a religious institution . need proof ? you can get married without the permission of the church but you cant get married without the permission of the government . and because marriage is a government institution then they cannot discriminate against same sex couples and must provide the same benefits to them as is provided to straight couples . and it cannot be a separate institution either because separate is not equal . but as i have already said this shouldnt be up for a vote . civil rights never should be .	0

i do not think this approach is all that new , but i have to admit that i have not been around as many of the old - school creationists . i have been around the creationist / science discussions for a number of years , about 20 or so . the " you believe in evolution " argument has been around for at least that long . in my experience it has been a waste of breath to try to convince creationists that i do not believe in evolution any more than they do . as i recall , the argument was even presented in a court case back in the late 6 0 s , or maybe it was the early 8 0 s . i could be wrong . i will have to check on that .	0
it is entirely premature to be discussing this matter for the purpose of promoting political positions and beliefs . it is also disrespectful to those that died and their families to try and capitalize on their pain for a political agenda . no relevant details have been discovered or released yet meaning all that can be had is pure speculation and hyperbole . the simple fact that authorities were able to apprehend the individual before he could commit suicide places us as a whole in a unique situation . the law abiding responsible gun owner who gunned them down did so respectfully , right ? emoticonxfrazzledyou gun crazies are the only ones with a sick political agenda , you ought to be all sent to a loony bin and given water pistols .	1

however , my point is that emotions alone cannot build a case for theism or atheism . when such is the case , it is no different from a religion i think bringing " emotions " into the question of whether god exists or not tends to cloud the issue a bit . is not the essence of atheism a rational enquiry which concludes that in the absence of any credible evidence , there is no reason to believe in god ? an emotional attachment to " non - belief " would be irrelevant ( and irrational ) .	0

i have posted this before , but i will post it again to filter out the digressive posts of the anti - gun people . <repeated> i guess they were hoping to change the subject to something they could debate , but it did not seem to work , now did it ? statistically , tobacco kills nine times as many people as all homicides and gun accidents combined , and alcohol kills almost twice as many as die in gun - related deaths .

actually , you are very incorrect in that matter . before it ' s spreading to the united states , it was predominately a heterosexual disease in africa . it ' s disease vector into the north american contanent just so happened to have been via a gay man , yes , . <repeated> so it was in that population in north america that got hit the hardest . however , your statement on a ' world wide ' basis is the sheerest ignorance . nice spin . would you have preferred " the civilized world " instead ? or western civilization or gay western civilization ? your preference ? one case in 1959 is not a pandemic .	1

<allcaps> lol </allcaps> ! and ' basically ' . <repeated> banning firearms ( as often proposed by many democrats ) is ' reasonable ' ? get bent ! well , " reasonable " is clearly subjective . <repeated> so the authors of the letter are practicly saying that any gun laws not interfering with the state militia would be permited according to the second amendment . but that gun laws obviously should be reasonable . but what reasonable is , is best left to the democratic will of the people . or am i reading it wrong ?	0

nope . big foot , dragons , unicorns , mermaids , there are scientific factors that makes their existence unlikely to live in the current environment . such as size , evolution , and nature ufos , god , fairies , magic , theres no scientific studies that disproves nor supports them . so i guess yes , its 50 / 50 theres no scientific studies that disproves nor supports them . so i guess yes , its 50 / 50 so more or less half of these are likely to exist right ? every imaginary thing that i could make up , half of that is probable to existing if they all can not be proven or disproven ?	0
i am not exactly sure your point with this article . was it merely to show that pro - choice groups exaggerate claims ? that they use emotional rhetoric to sway people to their side ? trust me , you have told me nothing new . in fact , i am somewhat amused that you pointed this out , given that pro - life groups are guilty of all this and more . it said : although the thought of finding a deceased young woman with a bloody coat hanger dangling between her legs is - - to say the least - - unpleasant , powerful and emotionally charged rhetoric does not a good argument make . i almost peed myself laughing when i read this . whatever powerful , emotional images you believe pro - choice are guilty of , pro - life groups are many times worse . what is the mental image of a deceased young woman compared to the physical picture of bloody aborted fetus ' ? i have seen pro - life groups holding huge posters outside high - schools , and pro - life groups hold them up in front of clinics . how much do you want to bet that the fellow here would defend one while attacking the other ? the article speaks of fallacies yet fails to mention the statement of ' abortion is wrong because it ' s murder ! ' that pro - life people seem very fond of . this is the exact fallacy the article mentions , using an unproven point ( abortion is murder ) to hold up an unproven point ( abortion is wrong ) . i point this out not to absolve pro - choice groups of guilt , but to say : before pointing fingers , make sure your own house is in order . this entire article is also something of a strawman argument as well . the argument that illegal abortions will almost inevitably occur if abortion is banned is not a justification for legal abortions ( per se ) . as i see it , since illegal abortions will almost inevitably occur if abortions are banned , the complaint is that pro - life people would rather see more women hurt ( and yes , more women are hurt with illegal abortion than legal ) than actually solve the problems with society . to ban abortion and declare the problem solved is extremely irresponsible and does nothing to help society or women . if you would , chloe , please link to the study the article mentions about the number of illegal abortions ? i ’ m amazed they managed to eek out numbers , given that not even the cdc has exact figures since illegal abortions were not tracked . the most compelling evidence i ’ ve seen looked at the birth rates for various ethnic groups the years previous to abortion being legal to the years after , corrected for various factors such as better birth control methods . they found little change in the birth rates , indicating the number of abortions most likely did not increase or decrease . yes , i know pro - choice groups mislead with stats and figures . this is nothing new , but i feel it is dishonest to point this out without acknowledging your own groups shortcomings in the same area . well sigma , which is more painful ? <repeated> being burnt with salene for 30 minutes to an hour and if that doesnt work after the 3 rd time , being born prematurally and laid on a table and starving to death . <repeated> <allcaps> or a </allcaps> woman sticking a clothes hanger up and accidentally killing herself but intentionally killing the kid within her ? seems to me that people dont really care about how the baby feels . it has just as much feeling as the mother .	0

why do you make such a big issue of this ? if you are in this forum , and you have seen this post , then creation vs evolution obviously strikes a nerve with you - why ? ! <repeated> what is so fascinating about something you will never live long enough to witness if it does exist and that you have seen all there is to see of if it does not exist ? does anyone here really lack in something to validate themselves so much that they have to turn to a bunch of dead animals to find a reason for living ? well , thank you for this thread santafeur . i must say though that i peruse various threads just to read stuff . the c vs . e topic does not strike a nerve with me . in fact , i also wonder what it is about the human mind that makes people so desperate to want to know how we came about . what difference does it make ? we are here now . could we possibly just accept that we got here somehow , and just move on ?	0
a position of pro - choice is pro - life because the lives and quality of life of women are valued . the quality of life ethic is far different from sactity / dignity of life ethic . a quality of life ethic carried out to its logical conclusions does not promote a pro - life society . instead , there would be genocide against the handicapped , elderly , and people who people of power have deemed life unworthy of life . the problem with this ethic is that it is centered in arbritrary people deciding arbritarily which person passes the " quality of life " test .	0

if there are many people reading this that already believe in evolution , or for that matter , believe in biblical creationism , then it is important to keep in mind that the people appealing to science have biases at work , regardless of how objectively rationalistic they present themselves . well , i do not believe in evolution . i believe in things for which i have no evidence . and while it is true that everyone has bias , using correct science and the process of peer review works to eliminate . not all is perfect , and people are people , but overall the system works . not a lot of bad science gets through . in the case of " creation science " we know that there is no science involved . only talk that sounds scientific . there is no hypothesis , prediction or testing . only ad hoc stories constructed of selected bits of evidence to support the foregone conclusion .	0
i am not arguing that gun control will change the nature of men - though guns may make them more willing and confident to engage in crime . with guns criminals can do even more damage . adding guns to crime is like adding gasoline to a fire - it makes an already existing problem worse . if you think that just as many people die from stabbing and beatings in other developed nations as people die from guns in the us then you need to do more research . you are apparently unwilling to extend your thinking process to the other side of the argument galileo , and by this i mean , and repeat that it is not criminals owning hand guns which we defenders of gun rights are fighting for . <allcaps> we agree that criminals shouldn </allcaps> ' <allcaps> t be armed </allcaps> , and the laws already exist on the books to punish them when convicted criminals are caught with guns . but your solution to disarm all honest citizens in the belief that this will make them unavailable to criminals also is ludicrous to the point of self destructive insanity . it is that premise which we are fighting against through the <allcaps> nra </allcaps> and other lobbying efforts .	1
i am against abortion but pro - choice . whether the fetus is human is not something that i think is really relevant to the matter , and in any case where we give it the benefit of the doubt it is still permissable to carry out abortions in order to safeguard a woman ' s autonomy . if the fetus is human is not relevant ? so if everyone says it is human then it still does not have a right to live then huh ? do you really support the killing of an innocent life for whatever reason ? do you really think placing one human over another is good ( in this case women is more important then baby ) ?	0
did i just see a draw pistol and shoot ones self in foot here ? your foot would do service as a colander . in australia , a weapon may be legally held for many reasons . self defence is not one of them . you might legally own a weapon for sport shooting , but use it to defend yourself . how hard is that to understand ? for a supposed ' expert ' not to realise that a drawn pistol is not pointing at ones foot , is a major error commonly made by fantasy gunners .	1
sounds like a fact which has been blown out of all proportion - possibly by the pro - gun side attempting to ridicule it . it is a fact , however , that the presence of a gun can increase aggression levels in individuals . see other times i have brought this up , here ( to the end of the thread ) and here ( again , that post till the end of the thread ) . can cause aggression , does not mean that it will though . alcohol has a far greater record of this but yall are not trying to ban that . so do women but we arent going to ban them now are we , sorry but i was in a marriage from hell and just had to throw that in .	1
ugh , the stupidity . i read the first chapter , here ' s some good excerpts . it ' s helpful if one understands evolution before one attempts to debunk it . that ' s just a blatant lie . the vast majority of mutations are actually neutral . one word : archaeopteryx . i know what you mean . you should see some of the other " books " he has at his site as well . well , now we know that muslim creationists are even nuttier than christian creationists , but both still use the same twisted ideas and concepts to justify their pseudo - science of creationism ( read : religious beliefs ) . <wink>	0
you are so right - on in what you say ! in a sunday school at a church i formerly attended , an elder of the church remarked that his " faith was strengthened " by the " evidence " afforded by recent archaeological discoveries in the middle east . in a tone i now rather regret , i blurted out two things . <repeated> how weak was your faith before ? and . <repeated> if the " evidence " had gone ' the other way , ' would your faith then have been weakened ? his answer for the second question was a simple ' no , ' which suggests to me that the sense of the term ' evidence ' he was employing was not the same sense you ' d expect a scientist to use . his response to the first was problematic , and interesting . " my faith , " he said , has always been - - then he used the most interesting word - - " complete . " but he had taken sufficient offence already , it seemed , that i pressed no further . i wish sometimes that i ' d asked : if your faith was " always complete , " did the archaeological evidence make it " more complete " ? and , if so , does your sense of ' complete ' match that word ' s usual application ? i do not quite grasp the notion of there being " scientific evidence " for a proposition within the realm of faith . i do not mean to suggest that my claim that scientific and religious propositions reside in different discourses disposes of all worry or complaint . activity in one realm may be felt in the other . but , re : evolution , i think this . <repeated> given convincing evidence that , say , the earth is billions of years old , not thousands - - a mound of evidence more than high enough for my needs - - my worry is not that the ' biblical account ' of creation is wrong , erroneous , falsified . <repeated> but rather is the quite different worry of wondering what , now , that account ' s meaning is , what it affirms . scientific discovery , evidence , and discourse thus do not " disprove the bible . " rather , they serve to displace interpretations of biblical text , and give us cause - - i call it : opportunity - - to find new , richer meaning in scripture . i am often embarrassed by the smallness and brittleness of certain christians ' interpretations . emphasizing the ' literal , ' as some do - - a very problematic term in itself - - some christians see in , for example , the genesis " tree of the knowledge of good and evil " nothing more than a tree . a biological tree . pear tree . peach tree . apple tree . tree of the knowledge of good and evil . albeit a special species , nonetheless a species . and , for them , there you go - - eve chowed down on the fruit of a proscribed species , and that ' s your story . lost , in the insistence upon and closing of that interpretation , is the richness of metaphor the story offers . metaphor , again and again , is variously deliberately denigrated or unconsciously eclipsed , in the readings of certain christians . science is not the only victim of such cheesily ' literal ' interpretation . christian faith - - at least , the possibility of a rich faith robustly aware of its own weight in metaphor , parable , legend and myth , and the transformative power that arises from those aspects of scripture - - is equally victim . i feel more sadness about such a limited believer ' s faith than i do about that person ' s science . master_shake , for your poignantly apt remark - - " what they have is not faith at all " - - thanks . bless you ! brad you can have reasoned faith , but it need not rely on ' empirical ' evidence . there are very many forms of evidence .	0

then banning same - sex marrige would be wrong , and there would be no reason for it . unless it harms someone , a law should never be passed . a law baning same - sex marriage , then i ' d agree . but the reason same - sex marriage does not exist ( other than mass . ) is not because of law ; after all , there are plenty of states that do not have same - sex marriage with no law that outlaws it . you are barking up the wrong tree - - this is a cultural issue more than a legal one .	0
they are different terms and apply to different things . secularism is not a worldview in itself , it is a policy of how to apply religious and other worldview in real life . secularism does not exclude people with a religious worldview . one may imagine a devout christian that firmly believes in his faith , but is also convinced that faith must come from within and that forcing someone to behave in accordance with a religion simply encourages false faith , and would logically conclude that his faith should not be forced upon people ( usually with the subclause of " let them burn in hell afterwards " , or something else along those lines ) . so if an atheist believes that humans are the highest form of intelligence , and a devout christian believes god is the highest form of intelligence , the christian should allow the atheist to force him to behave as if humans are the highest form of intelligence ?	0

evolutionists have constructed the geologic column in order to illustrate the supposed progression of " primitive " life forms to " more complex " systems we observe today . yet , since only a small percentage of the earth ' s surface obeys even a portion of the geologic column , the claim of their having taken place to form a period of rock - - life - - time over the earth is therefore fantastic and imaginative thinking . this does not mean that the column is fantastic nor imaginative . it may very well be that not all areas of the earth accumulated all types of rock that form the column ; this does not mean that the years at which similar columns were deposited in different places in the world are not similar . and of course , even if the geologic column is not true , this provides no evidence of creationism .	0

so that if a cecal valve became necessary the lizard was ready to go . having the built - in redundancy makes this possible without missing a beat . " ready to go " , in the sense that living things are equipped with a means of making small errors which are used by natural selection to make new structures . barbarian , regarding mutations : there is a lot of that . many mutations are recessive and a population over time accumulates a lot of genetic variation that can become useful if the environment changes . the founder population of lizards , for example , could have had at most , 20 alleles for any gene locus , since each lizard can only have 2 . the new ones evolved by mutation . sometimes , we can even observe that happening , or trace the mutation back to a known ancestor . would you like to learn about it ? .	0

i know you think i was acting emotional with my post and it really is hard to tell whether someone is being emotional over a forum since it is so impersonal . what i can say is that posting about the bible has become a mere formality to me and not the emotional debate it used to be . however , i believe it is necessary to eliminate the bible from debates of this sort by discrediting it right away . then at least we can focus on real solutions based on what is real instead of what some weirdo wrote thousands of years ago . what we have here is simply a perspective problem , which is the problem with most debates . i see the bible as sound , and every " error " in the bible i have researched ( i have admittedly not researched them all ) have been refuted .	0
my point in starting the thread is not merely that christians fall short of their aspirations . no . <repeated> this is worse . because this particular u.s. senator , an avowed conservative christian , has actively worked to restrict the rights of others to marry , supposedly in the name of " protecting " or " defending " marriage , while at the same time undermining his own marriage . he makes a pretense , for political gain i suspect , of " defending marriage " by playing to people ' s anti - gay prejudices while himself undermining marriage in his real life . that ' s hypocrisy , and it ' s dishonesty . prove your assertion that he has called himself a conservative christian rather than a conservative republican op . support your clai if you can or stop trying to lump everyone on the right together .	0

] how many different ways can toe be invalidated ? in a scientific theory , there are no exceptions - - exceptions mean holes - - holes mean trouble . the answer is none so far . your article and the mechanism involved do not impact upon <allcaps> toe </allcaps> which makes only very broad assumptions about heritable elements . and what you reference does not constitute a hole in <allcaps> toe </allcaps> , although it may be a new mechanism of inheritance . yea , i often forget toe is a mental concept , not a scientific one . nothing - - and i mean nothing - - will ever dismantle it in the minds of the faithful . materialism is so entrenched in your mind that even if an animal generates a new piece of morphology by mere thought , sensation or awareness , and then passes that trait down to progeny , ( which has been shown on here ) you still think materialism stands . it ' s an unfalsifiable mindset that you and millions of others have created for yourselves .	1

is even ' channel ' sufficiently ateleological a verb ? yes . it describes an action without ascribing its form to its end result , outcome , whatever but strictly to a cause / s force / s in action . that is why ' selection ' is always teleological . in order to select or choose anything , an end must always be in view . there must always be a volitional discrimination of options based upon a criterion dictated by the desired end . the only time " channel " becomes teleological is when something live [ a human or a beaver , let us say ] intententionally does the channeling . but since it is understood that mechanical forces can also ' channel ' , unintentional , out of simple mechanics , the word channel cannot be called teleological . in the same way , ' sorting ' can be considered non - teleological , hence mechanical , and thus suited to your glossary , because things can be sorted by mechanical forces alone . but ' selection ' always requires volition and awareness . so ' selection ' is always teleological .	0

he was arrested and spent several hours in a cell when plainly he had not broken any laws . plain with the benefit of hindsight . i love how you are able to determine , not having been there , precisely what was said and precisely where it fell in relation to the law . if it was so clear , we will see the prosecution for wrongful arrest in due course , i am sure .	1

agreed , when the husband is part of a hetero relationship . gay husband is not a legally recognized category . agreed , when the wife is part of a hetero relationship . gay wife is not a legally recognized category . agreed , when the spouse is part of a hetero relationship . gay spouse is not a legally recognized category . so the fact that it is not legally recognized is the problem . what is the reason it ' s not legally recognized ? because the couple is gay .	1

so lets see how many other people are being targeted by the inquisition for their faith by the big three . let us see there is naturally me . jp by archie . and now esdraelon ( godzilla monster ? ) questioning romebigred . <repeated> so your saying that his beliefs do not hold sway with what the mormons teach ? or is it just that when he gives you evidence that counters your ignorance on his religion , your perceived opinion of mormonism is thus null and void ? thanks for that , jason . in esdraelon ' s defense , there are hundreds of authors of other religions who choose to take portions of our writ out of context , and morph them into something that looks like what he described . ( a self - made god who has an alotted portion of the universe . ) this is not the actual belief of lds . this is a skewed and exaggerated oversimplification of our doctrine of eternal progression . it ' s also what seems to be most commonly understood when an lds tries to briefly explain the doctrine . in other words , i am not surprised that esdraelon was under that impression .	0
the coelacanth , according to fossil records , and according to evolutionists , allegedly went extinct millions and millions of years ago . until they were found alive . coelacanth - wikipedia , the free encyclopediaas if this should be any surprise . the theory of evolution mindset once again contradicts observable science . there is just one thing however . the coelacanths found are different from those in the fossil record . further , <allcaps> all </allcaps> evidence pointed to them being extinct , until we found other evidence , and we changed it . and , to top it off , the article says <allcaps> nearly </allcaps> extinct , not <allcaps> completely </allcaps> . although , this article was of course written after the coelocanths were re - discovered . of course , this has absolutely nothing to do with the theory of evolution , which explains the mechanisms responsible for the change of allele frequencies in populations over time .	0
that is beside the point - - it is still the civil rights of black people that gay lobbyists often try to piggyback off of . it ' s disingenuous to suggest that gay people have suffered anywhere near the same level of oppression . ' if it ' s beside the point ' the why bring it up , jyoshu . why ' talk out of both sides of your mouth ' ? and your right wing talking points are stale and tired . comparing different civil rights movements is not ' piggybacking ' . and incidentally , why is it that all of the blacks in congress for equal rights for glbt people ? why is it that they are the most passionate defenders of glbt people ? there are black gay people who suffered along with the straight black people . there are female gay people that suffered along with the women . on top of such discrimination , gay people may have had no family support . some were probably lobotomized against their wishes . some were raped , some were probably murdered by people they thought would understand what discrimination was all about . no , my friend . it is disingenuous to say with certainty that you know they have not .	0
so if cells are controlled by their genes ( and the environment ) , what would you predict would happen to the cell if its genes were removed ? depends on which cell you mean . mammalian red blood cells , for example , have had their entire nuclei and mitochondria removed . not so much as a smidgeon of <allcaps> dna </allcaps> .	0
omegamon_x said something in another thread that that raised some questions in my mind : mainly : why ? specifically , why worry about the threat of potential harm from criminals ? statistically , the risk of such is relatively low compared to , say , the leading killer in the developed world . you face a much greater threat of potential harm from that than at the hands of a criminal . are you as adamant about eating healthy as you are about the need to have a gun ? the fact is , we all constantly face the threat of potential harm every minute of every day . risk is a part of living . i would like to know why guns specifically are needed to mitigate the risk of being the victim of a crime , when other methods ( better locks , alarms , non - lethal weapons like pepper spray and tasers ) can be effective . i think a more telling question would be , why the hell would you rather feel constantly threatened than feel safe ? it seems completely idiotic to me . smiley	0

" there ' ll be cheering for our results on the pro - life side and denouncing us angrily on the pro - choice side , neither of those positions is sound .

again show me something other than an opinion . describe how the avian lung could have evolved over time . other than it did it . maybe firstly you should explain how god works ? in what way does he manupilate matter in defience of the laws of physics , where does he dwell , how can we not observe such a being ? and all the other questions of the supernatural . the theory of a god is actually a lot , lot more complicated than evolution as you have to explain how <emphasis> god works to get even basic science points .	0

do you define weight as numerical or some kind of rating system on who is the most important church father . what part of darwinian evolution does the church not agree with ? that link also had the following quote . should modern science be able to prove without the shadow of a doubt that man evolved from amoeba , reptiles , animal life into what he is today , orthodox theology would be able to make the transitional acceptance far more readily than western theology for all the reasons stated above . if genesis in the bible is not a literal account of creation ( i , e . , six days , man from dust , fruit of good and evil ) then what is its use ? why include as the foundation of the entire bible a story that is either totally fabricated , or mostly inaccurate / metaphorical ? genesis 1 & 2 , in the literal application , has 2 vitally important concepts that the entire bible is totally useless without : 1 . god is sovereign and totally limitless in power 2 . man has disobeyed god and is in need of reconciliation everything else in the entire bible rests on these 2 premises . now if genesis has it wrong , then what is the use of any of the rest of the bible ? from all scientific perspective , genesis 1 & 2 never happened , and here the validity of the entire bible is questioned .	0
ah but interracial marriages were only socially prejudiced . there was no real biological basis for the prejudice . we know that interracial diversity is biologically sound . sometimes there are genetic or congenital anomollies that can be detrimental to the offspring of interracial couples , but these conditions do not preclude the validity of said relationships . you are trying to equate sexuality with racial diversity . this is a false equation , for one , we do know racial traits are inherited and that races can interracially reproduce . this trumps homosexuality ' s abilities two fold . yes , but we do not know that homosexuality is not inherited , and it is the arguments like this that make people want to prove that homosexuality is genetic . also , people born infertile cannot reproduce , so are those people inferior in a relationship because of what they cannot do ?	0

atheism is not a belief in the typical sense . it is a non - belief . it is the abscence of belief . a theist is one who beleives in one form of a diety or another . the prefix ' a ' means without . thus an atheist is one without a beleif in one form of a diety or another . as to the idea of your question my non beleif comes from the lack of evidence and logic in support of god as well as a lack of understanding of what is meant by ' god ' . i asked on another thread , but it fits here as well . <repeated> is there a distinction between the absence of belief in x and the belief in the absence of x ? before , i suggested that i could not see a distinction , but after pondering it for awhile , i believe there is a distinction between the two : if one asserts that there is no god ( or gods ) , this is a belief in the absence of god . if one makes no assertions one way or another ( even internally ) , then this would be an absence of belief . i am not certain into which ' side ' atheism would fall , though i believe it would have to be the former , and therefore , a belief . the latter sounds more like agnosticism to me . but perhaps someone else can better clarify this topic .	0

but it comes down to gay people being harmed by not being allowed to marry . any time a group is excluded because of someone elses religious beliefs that group is harmed . marriage is a secular condition set up by various societies over the millenia and one of the prerequisites set out is that such a union should be between people of different genders . religion has supported this and sanctified it but did not invent it . you do not curse the church you lobby society to see if you can effect a change . people who believe the different gender aspect are entitled to lobby for no change .	0

i do not think the point was to come up with an exact number of gun laws . the point was to show that the 20,000 figure often claimed by the pro - gun side is very doubtful . but the total number of gun laws may not tell us a whole lot . 100 cities could pass laws to require waiting periods . that would count as 100 gun laws . or the federal government could pass one law to require a waiting period throughout the nation . it would count as one law but would have more of an effect than 100 separate city laws . and your point was demonstrated to be specious using your own source . to contain strawmen even as you claimed it to be a strawman .	0
on what grounds do you seek to redefine the institution of marriage from it ' s accepted standard in this country ? how about getting the government out of marriage entirely ? that is the goal of the libertarians , and maybe the liberals . no standards would be redefined if that happened , and gays would get their right to marry .	0

so if utah made a law or a governor stated that christians did not need protection because of their beliefs even if there were incidents of anti chrisitan beating and harassment let alone murder for their beliefs you would just say let states have their own laws ? people are protected by law from being harassed , assaulted and / or murdered because they are people . not because they are a certain religion . because they are people it would be wrong to allow such things .	0

<url> did the anglerfishes evolve their rods and lures ? . <repeated> and why do they need such big teeth ? i will address the later question . they may not " need " teeth that big , i could not say . just because a creature has a feature does not mean its necessary or useful . while evolution does select for useful traits and against harmful traits , that does not mean that a trait will not develop that is simply odd . as long as it is not particularly negative there ' s no reason to assume it will go away , and so sometimes you get traits that are not " useful " , they are simply not harmful . those teeth could be such a case .	0
the reason the dems wimp out is because the gun nuts votes are likely to be swayed by a candidate ' s position on gun control , whereas non gun nuts , while having an opinion , are most likely concerned about other issues . it is the same reason people do not tend to come out loudly pro - choice , even though the majority of the us population are pro - choice . well said . most americans favor more gun control , but unfortunately this majority of americans tends not to vote based on the issue of gun control while a very vocal minority composed of gun activists definitely does vote based on the issue . this is something politicians have realized since 1994 so they have been more hesitant to support gun control . there probably will be more gun control supporters in office in the coming years but i am not sure how much this will change things .	0
the difference , and i think it is a significant difference , is that omegamon spoke of feeling the threat of potential harm . i believe that understanding the risks that are faced every day does not require being fearful of those risks . nor does it require being stupidly fearless . we all take reasonable steps to reduce our risk of danger every day . to me , the use of a firearm to reduce risk does not seem all that reasonable . the intent of my opening post was to find out why omegamon and others feel differently . because we have different experiences than you and are more educated on the subject . the only ones who tend to ask " why do you feel you need a firearm to protect yourself " are the ones who have never faced such a situation and do not know what it ' s like to be in such a position .	1
well , that depends what far fetched ideas someone has i imagine . so lets get this straight ; you say it is fine to pick and choose which bits of the bible you accept , but it is not okay to try revisit passages in the light of other knowledge from outside the bible ? i just ask because i find that an interesting position to adopt . if reality conflicts with the bible , there are people that tend to ' reinterpret ' the bible so that to them it agrees with reality . this is inexcusable in my opinion . to me , the very fact that they convince themselves that the bible says something it doesnt is worse than simply admitting that the bible contradicts reality . what is the point of depending on the bible for truth when youre going to interpret it to suit something entirely contrary ? its like telling your kids that the moon is made of cheese , and then later when confronted with contradictory evidence , rather than admit you lied , you tell your kids that they misinterpreted what you said .	1
no , of course sexuality is not strictly about behavior . the point is that religious belief about behavior is about behavior . of course i agree with you about sexuality , but that is a different issue . the point is that it is not innateness that is opposed by religion . it is a behavioral issue . saying something someone <allcaps> does </allcaps> is immoral is not the same as saying <allcaps> they </allcaps> are immoral . i do appreciate your point while i disagree on principle . i guess it boils down to the fact that even if i believed in a god i could not accept that he would command us to suppress our true innate nature . why would he makes us that way and then expect such a thing ? christians especially are indoctrinated from early on with the notion that that is exactly what god commands . to suppress a good many natural inclinations . to accept that we are sinful by nature and need to be punished , our nature brought to heel .	0

this is nonsense . iremaeus and clement of alexandria both attribute the gospel of john to john . these liberal theories of yours are only that - theories , with no historical , archeological , or traditional evidence to support them . the q source is just another wild theory without any trace of historical , traditional , or archaeological evidence to support it . the earliest church fathers attributed the gospels to the apostles or authors whose names they presently bear . let me guess - you also believe that moses wrote the torah , wherein he describes his own death and burial ? ' wild theory ' ? i suggest you do an internet search on the synoptic problem and the related two - source theory . why do you demand that which you know cannot be produced ? no , we do not have the q source , but we have evidence which points to a q source . likewise , we have a great deal of evidence which suggests that the torah had multiple authors .	0

. <repeated> but i still do not see any evolution in the peppered moths ! <repeated> how do you define evolution ? if you do not see any , then you are not using the definition used by evolutionary biologists . the question is who should define the vocabulary of evolutionary biologist , evolutionary biologists or creationists ?	0
so does this mean they have to get tougher on gun control or softer before the results go their way ? that is the real question . my guess is that we are caught in the unhappy medium where going in either direction will be more successful than where we are now . so then will you go the way on liberty ( repeal stoopid laws ) or tyranny ( enact more unconstitutional laws ) ?	1
there ' s just enough truth in that statement to keep me from saying it ' s false , but if i analyze it , it will help make my point ; the word " evolution " has such a broad meaning that it does not have to mean atheism , but it since it is practically the only weapon that atheists have to combat the religious worldview , that ' s what it often <allcaps> does </allcaps> mean . if it should not mean it , but it is used so that it does , then that ' s what it actually means . creationism means religion , but it also involves a belief in the authenticity of historical documents that have been meticulously preserved over thousands of years . that ' s not just religion , it ' s secular , observed history - something evolution does not have . so if a person hearing your statement does not consider it carefully , it ' s very easy to be mislead by it . it implies that " evolution " ( the branch that declares that the book of genesis is false ) is somehow a secular , observable truth - while creationism is nothing but a religion , a superstition . since evolution can not prove the book of genesis ( ancient history ) false , and creationism does have some historical backing , they are comparable and they directly conflict . the problem is , a school teacher can make the statement you made , and it can not be legally questioned by anyone . yet there was a case that i read about somewhere , where a sticker was placed in science textbooks advising children to study evolution " with an open mind " , and an <allcaps> aclu </allcaps> lawsuit ensued . of all those likely to be mislead by your statement , it ' s young impressionable school children . publicly paid school teachers misleading them with statements like that , without a full explanation ( prohibited by the courts ) does get an establishment of atheism started . it ' s what i mean when i say that when church and state are separated , atheism and state are combined . maybe government could be neutral , if it was small . the u.s. government is no longer small . do the christians that you know that believe in evolution , believe that there was no first man named adam , or that there was no genesis flood ? the term " evolution " needs to be narrowed down - more clearly defined , for these discussions . true , but what i was trying to state is that the bible has little to do with christianity if you dont believe in it . i know many christians who believe in god , and jesus etc , but think the bible is completely false , and is only a book of fables . thats what i was trying to imply .	0
it is our contention that it ' s the pro - death advocates who misrepresent the facts in order to justify their infanticidal proclivities and justifications as they release women of all personal responsibility and expect the innocent child to be sacrificed at the alter of their immoral lifestyle so they can continue to act irresponsibly . so every woman who has an abortion lives an irresponsible life . care to give any examples , or are you just spouting rubbish with no experience or knowledge whatsoever ?	0
ok , let us give that a try . evolution does not require something to have evolved from nothing , so this is not a valid criticism . evolutionary theory seeks to explain the plain fact of common descent . i know that . evolution releases itself from its foundation at will . when it wants to speculate about things like abiogenesis and claim it to be science , it allows itself to do that . it ' s that interchangeability thing you spoke of above .	1
those quotes have nothing to do with abortion . this one has to do with babys in the woumb " befor i formmed you in the woumb , i knew you , and before you were born i consecrated you ; i appointed you a prophet amoungst nations " jeremiah 1 : 4 - 5 i think this is rellavent because god wants everyone to be a prophet who he can work through . if that were true , why are there millions of miscarriages each year ? i do not believe a word of it .	0
for those who are pro - life , how much of a role does your belief in a soul ( assuming you hold such beliefs ) play into your views on abortion ? to explore this , would your views on a particular abortion change if you knew for certain that a particular fetus has no soul ? the reason i bring this up is that , for those of us with largely secular views , the idea of the soul is closely analogous to our idea of mental existence , sentience , etc . i suspect , therefore , that much of our thinking may end up being similar but that you view this mental essence as starting at conception and we take the scientific view of it happenning much later in a pregnancy . i know that , apart from that arguement , you value potential more than we do . however , i suspect that concepts of the soul do play a role in the views of most on the pro - life side . would you be willing to discuss such ideas ? i think more than this is the principle of human dignity . that humans have inherent dignity and value at every stage of life . this is transcendent of whether they are conscious or unconscious and it is why we treat 24 week premies who have no real conscious existence and a 30 year old automobile accident victim in a coma on a respirator and you and me the same . so strongly do humans recognize this inherent dignity that even in death a person is dignified with a funeral ceremony recognizing their life had inherent meaning and value . we build memorials to those who were victimized in life .	0
and what of when you go by some moral standard to determine what is right and wrong in other peoples ' lives as well ? what ? you do not do that ? bull . you can not tell me you never have an opinion or judgment on anything anyone else does . but by your logic , that would be imposing on them . sorry , that dog just does not hunt . everyone has some basis for the views they have about they way they think society would be best . there ' s no law that says people can not participate in that process with religion or anything else as their moral basis . ' imposing religion ' is not the same as using religion as a basis , and it ' s the fact that you are wrong on this that ' s why religious people are continually able to have religion as their basis of social change , just as equally as anything else . except several rligious organizations around the country have financed , and gathered signatures to put anti gay marriage amendments on the ballot . they have a religious belief that marriage is between one man and one woman . they have turned this belief into law regaurdless of the religious beliefs of gay people . any one who has voted yes to place these amendments into state constitutions because they have a religious belief that excludes gay people from marriage has also imposed those religious beliefs upon gay people . in short i have been barred from marrying the person i love because someone else , that i do not know and who does not know me , has some sick religious belief .	0
atheists do , but it does not necessarily mean that they represent science . you have not gotten in over your head – most who post here do not know much about science . tq does not , and of course he will tell you that i do not . there ' s a big difference between science , and the creation / evolution controversy . many atheists who seem to be interested in science are actually only interested in it to the point that it helps them feel “ intellectually fulfilled ” , to discredit religion . some of the best reading on the creation / evolution controversy is not written by scientists , but by philosophers who have done just enough scientific homework on the subject to keep a clear focus on the controversy , without confusing it with too much detail . michael ruse and bradley monten are two excellent atheist authors on the subject . religious authors , practically too many to name . william dembski , david berlinski , phillip johnson , cornelius hunter , many others . you would do well to read anything by any of these people . far too many young people seem to make the mistake of getting most all of their information from rabid atheists who are also degreed biologists , like richard dawkins . he ' s become a celebrity , and most degreed biologists who are not rabid atheists are a little to timid to take him on in a very direct way , without fear of discrimination , academic or otherwise . michael behe is one of the few who has been somewhat successful at it , not in avoiding discrimination , but in his ability to make a comfortable living in spite of it . read “ the edge of evolution ” , or “ darwin ' s black box ” sometime . <happy> oh yes , mr behe makes a comfortable living out of selling to the ignorant . his newest book is just a rehash of his old book , and has the very same flaws that have been destroyed over and over again . as for your ' religious authors ' being respected . <repeated> they are respected perhaps by the fundamentalists that do not understand what science is about .	1
i think his point is paulie , that if evolution is actually as evo defines it , as changes made by way of random mutations , then why does not life reflect those random mutations ? for example , why have not a large number of lower animals who live their lives being hunted by carnivores adapted eyes in the back of their heads as a needed early warning system to see their stalkers coming from behind them ? especially in times of drought and famine when food is scarce ? the environmental pressure exists at those times to justify such a change , yet from fish to birds to reptiles to mammals to even insects , most every creature in creation has 2 eyes , 1 mouth , 2 ears , ( if they even have ears since some animals use vibration sensors to locate the movement of prey and predator . ) it makes sense that eagles , hawks and falcons have only 2 eyes since they are apex predators which rule their skies . but they regularly swoop down on smaller birds and pluck them out of the sky for food for their young . so why have not smaller birds found the need to evolve eyes in the back of their heads ? they have . prey animals have their eyes to the sides of their heads which allows them to see in every direction , almost 360 degrees around . predator animals have their both eyes facing forward .	0
rubbish , there are many that argue otherwise . the life of twins can be viewed as starting at the moment the zygote / embryo splits for example . the reality though is there is no single point at which a human life begins : the moment the egg and sperm form , the moment of conception , first division and implantation , the moment the heart starts to beat , the moment of birth etc all mark stages in the formation of a new life . oh yeahrubbish rubbish , scientifically speaking , human life ( using a most bsic term ) begins at conception . the twins exist as two seperate entities the moment each contains the individual human dna . seems to me you better be certain when it begins before you go around ending it . if you are driving at night an you " think " you might see a person ahead in the middle of the road you are hopefully not gonna drive over that person . instead that uncertainty should lead you to stop . if you dont like that example , consider a hunter who is unsure what is in the bushes .	0
let me rephrase , what in the life of jesus do you have a problem with ? not a problem in the practices of the church or the people , but in the being that we believe in . which part do you have a problem with , or do you simply have a problem with the fact that is a " religion " . this is a very simple , easily answerable question . most people , especially in america , have problems with people telling them what to do . teenagers hate being under the authority of adults . adults hate being under the authority of the government and enforcers of the law . everyone in the world is under worldly authority , but to actually have a god who created you , which gives him the right to make commandments stating what is good for you and what is not , that makes most people really <allcaps> x <elongated> </allcaps> off .	0

wrong . 1 ) science has disproven the young - earth creationists ' god . 2 ) science is starting to shed light on people ' s spiritual beliefs . i will agree science has disproven the literal reading of a number of different scriptures , such as the literal reading of genesis ( which was never meant to be literal to begin with , but that is a different matter ) . it also might explain why spiritiual beliefs exist for people . however , when it comes to this vaguly defined entity that alledgely created the universe , science has nothing to say about the existance of this alledged supernatural being .	0

intellignet design seems to have a large following . the fact that somebody believes in intellient design does not necessarily mean that they disagree with evolution . a lot of folks ( i would say the majority ) view it as evolution used as a vehicle for intellient design ( basically " god planned it and made it all happen " ) . now you have ruined it ! you are not supposed to mention god . that ' s the whole idea . id is stealth creationism . <allcaps> x <elongated> </allcaps> pretend that there is some scientific basis for the assertion that there is some sort of magical designer that is responsible for everything , but they do not say it ' s god . if they did that , then id would be religion and introducing it into schools would be unconstitutional .	1

well , since you are the only presenting that argument , i am glad you recognize how stupid it is so we can drop it . prove that . give evidence . anything . you said that someone who claims harm without evidence is a bigot . show us your evidence or admit to being a bigot . and lest you make a foolish claim , allow me to point out that the fact that you personally do not like how something is changing does not mean that ' s it ' s been harmed . you will have to do better than that . now you are just playing games . you claimed the institution is not being harmed . i said it really is - - what else would you call it if the instution as we know would be done away with ? the evidence is that if the institution as we know it is done away with for something else , it will no be there anymore . that ' s how it ' s harmed . if marriage is opened up to change everytime a group with a different sort of relationship comes along wanting it to be redefined , it would become something much more open - ended , broadened to meaninglessness . if that ' s not damage to an institution , i do not know what is .	0

often , this debate becomes dotted with examples of things like human vegetables who might come out of their coma as potential people who are not really people , or a person who was knocked out in a brawl as a potential person who is not ( on some level ) currently a person , and many other examples . we often believe it is immoral to kill people in these conditions , so the potentiality argument says that a fetus is just as sacred and requires our protection . there is never a question of " killing people " in such circumstances , it a matter of deciding if treatment should be withdrawn and thus allow them to die , i . e . where there is no possibility of any sort of a recovery .	0

* there is abundant evidence that many of the rock strata were laid down quickly , one after the other , without significant time breaks between them . for example , preservation of ripple marks requires rapid burial , as in the flood ( e . g . lower triassic rock , england ) . folding of sedimentary rock without cracking or heating , such as at eastern beach , auckland , new zealand , suggests the folding occurred before the sand and mud had time to turn into stone , consistent with rapid deposition during the flood . this is simply false . rock can be folded under pressure . this has been proven by lab experiment . however there are many features in sedimentary rocks that cannot be formed quickly , for example , fossil trackways .	0

would depend on how sucessful they thought the handing in was , but do not you have to register for a leicence ? so all legal owners are know already and can be checked off against the guns they have handed in , i would imagine that there must be departments of the police who deal with tracking black market unregisted guns so these could be cracked down opon . in addition you would have to make possesion of a firearm illegal , then you have to balance defending your property with revealing you are commiting a crime ( will be fairly obvious if you use one and you would have to get rid of it anyway when forensics investigate the crime scene ) . would also have to look at countries that have carried out sucessful ones to see if there are any little points or mistakes to pick up . if there is a lot of resistance you could make possesion of a gun attempted murder , would make people think very carefully whether they would want to carry them , especailly criminals - comunity service or light sentace for a mugging or long term prison sentance for attempted murder if they are carrying a gun while doing it , even in bank robbery they would likely think twice about the additional years . wow ehat a brave new world you live in . <repeated> now lets say just 1% of all gun owners resisted ( in the us that is several hundred thousand peppered through the land ) . with media attention to such infighting between government and citizens how do you deal with this ?	1

the problem , however , becomes more manageable once you realize that all you need is a computer with a database that shows where all the food / water hoarders live . no such database exists , to the best of my knowledge ; certainly not one we could gain access to . and in any event , post - apocalypse technology will be limited to things that operate without electricity , for the most part , so maintaining and powering a computer after the end of the world would be pretty much impossible . i think you need to take your plan back to the drawing board , as it all hinges on this one ill conceived idea . also , even if your computer idea worked and was a reality , you just told a whole bunch of people about it , so now you have unwanted competition . hmm <elongated> . <repeated> , unwanted competition . <repeated> , i guess you are all on that database then <wink>	0

if something happens to the people who are named on the website as a direct result of the website then i would say a great deal of justice is due and the burden of guilt is on the one who runs the website . maybe i should give a list of all the homosexuals in my community to a group of drunk rednecks . <repeated> this is as bad as the registered sex offender list . notice the double - standard here ? the homosexual lobby accuses us of harassment , yet they are willing to provide names and addresses of people who oppose their agenda . i can not wait to see the backlash from this one .	0
that ' s a false analogy . people who are sexually attracted to children harm children , and harming someone is a crime . homosexuals do no harm to anyone , and are nothing like pedophiles . and for someone who does not tolerate government intrusion , you sure seem to like government intrusion when it comes to interfering with marriage . huh ? are we talking about gays or fornicators ? fornicators being someone who has sex before marriage and gay being a man who is attracted to a man in the same way a straight man is attracted to a woman . lets stay on topic . i dont need a sex lesson from a little boy . once again you missed the point ( getting to be a habit ) . we are talking about behaviour that was condemned by the preacher , one of which was adultery . <repeated> not fornicating but i am sure the preacher would condemn that too if you read the link you would know . if homosexuality is condemned by god then they cannot marry in gods eyes . <repeated> keeping up ? if gays cannot marry then gay sex must be outside of marriage therefore it is fornicating . you really should try to use your little head more .

well , if all you care is yourself and you are not burdened by conscience , go ahead and abort whenever it is expedient . i can see that you are so badly scarred by your bad choices in men , and your rape , that ' control over your body ' has become paramount to you . it is understandable to give your son a homosexual as substitute father ? i am not so sure about that . typical pro - life , woman - hating schmuck . i am pro - choice so i must be selfish whore who aborts all the time . you are not worth the energy it takes to type . i am sure its no greater than your own . i mean , only a scarred woman could want autonomy , right ? real women should be door mats , that way you do not ever have to attempt being a real man . way way over the line . he is an amazing , committed , loving , amazing father . maybe you , like my ex - husband , think being father is about who you # # # # . and like him , you probably think thats also where it ends as well . both myself and my son ' s adopted ( real ) father have higher standards than that .	1

i have to disagree with 1 and 3 . if god exists , and he wanted his existence proven , he could prove it . likewise , if he wanted to have an impact , he could . i will agree with 1 and 3 if you add " as things stand now " , or words to that effect . we cannot prove the existence of god for , by definition , he dwells in a reality outside our own . similarly , i cannot prove the existence of a flying shoe in hyperspace , nor can i disprove it , but i can prove that the flying shoe does not exist in our world because it exists , by definition , in hyperspace . i can make up anything i want and say it exists in another universe . a round square , a colorless green idea that sleeps furiously , you name it .	0

your question , which has been pointed out already , has a theological basis - god is supposed to have given us dominion over the rest of creation etc . but what separates us from other mammals ( if we restrict the question to that class of vertebrates ) is reckoned to be " self consciousness " - the human mind that can deliberate upon and analyse its own thought processes . and how do you know what other animals can analyze ? is that another supreme abilities of us humans ? to read the minds of animals ?	1

well , one would think that a skeptic would only base assertions on objective ideas and motives rather than being a reactionary , which is basically what you are saying here . regardless of whether or not ' people go around loudly proclaiming that every single word of the bible is literally true , and that everyone should believe that ' there should still be an objective way for skeptics to approach evidence for the existence of jesus . if what you say is true and skeptics are simply being reactionary , then that makes them all the more less objective in their approach . why can not skeptics be reactionary ? do not you know people who automatically distrust everything said by bush , or by liberals , or any group you like ? why should skeptics be any more objective than the average population ? some will be very objective , some will be very reactionary , most will fill in the spectrum in between . i belive that the majority are in the middle , you seem to be focusing on the reactionary end .	0
i do not see any problem with the jehova ' s or any other ' s idea of a scriptural account . once the debate has begun , i will not make another post until the end . one week sounds reasonable - you might want to post within a shorter gap later on , but that will be up to the person posting . you should both be able to post in your own time . a week is sufficient , i should think . i recommend that no limit be placed on posts , but that it is recommended that posts stay generally smaller . it ' s far more challenging to be succint than to write gallons . one more tip : it ' s a good idea to , in your first posts , include definition so that terms might be clarified , and it avoids later , unecessary hassle . if we just wait for hank ' s clarification on those few points , then we can then begin ! i know this would be somewhat of a drain on your time but i think it would be helpful if you would make a short post at the end of each post stating how much time the next poster has , what post number this is , how many are left , any comments concerning going outside the rules , etc .	0
yeah , there are those who scream that self - defence is not a valid reason for gun ownership . there were no valid reasons until the libs thought them up , but i will set that aside for now . the question here is wether or not you think hunting is a valid reason for gun ownership . i do not forsee any stats posted , as this thread has nothing to do with crime . so this is a chance for you to work on debating skills . i think the only valid reason for owning a gun is because you want to . every person ( with some exceptions ) has the right to keep and bear arms , why you do it is your own business . giving specific reasons for gun ownership is the top of a slippery slope towards banning certain firearms . while i have specific reasons for owning specific guns , to include hunting , i own some of my guns for no other reason than they are fun to shoot . a humorus side note : i own one gun strictly for fishing , sounds odd but its common practice ( at least in alaska ) to shoot large halibut before bringing them aboard .	0
do not buy into this leftist propaganda icare , god is neither a republican nor an american so ones political party has no bearing on our salvation . what we do know though is that god honors truth and morality and obama represents none of that . a vote for mccain is a vote for democracy . a vote for obama is a vote for socialism . so a vote for an adulterous divorcee is a vote for morality ? is this election being held in wonderland ? i am pretty sure mccain falls foul on bearing false witness as well .	1
what is supposed to take thousnds / millions of years for populations of animals to evolve has just taken a swift punch to the gut by david reznick . well , yes . eleven years is quite swift , but it actually supports the theory of evolution through natural selection . the estimates of the speed of evolution that you seem to be depending on were done by george gaylord simpson way back in the 1 9 4 0 s or 1 9 5 0 s . since then , we have observed fruit flies , as well as other specimens , to evolve quite rapidly , showing significant evolution in only a decade or so . more recently , however , scientists have been able to observe evolution in natural settings and have found that it can sometimes be quite rapid when environmental change is rapid . besides the studies that reznick did on guppies , there are also the studies of the galapagos finches by the grants , and studies of anole lizards in the bahamas . these are observable phenotypical changes , not speciation events .	0
no , it ' s because there is no evidence of their existence . for instance , we can not see air , but we have evidence of its existence . the most valid argument is that there are planets that can support life . i say it ' s valid because this is true ( unlike other alien arguments ) . but this is not a good argument for alien existence because the conditions themselves do not prove life . they just prove conditions . my goodness . i spoke to fast . <happy> i will give you that one . i am shocked you even took the time to reply to my petty argument .	0
yes . except the government has no say in any of it . which is the way i like it . <wink> oh yeah . that is the one up - side of it . bleh ! <tong>	0
yet it is a conculsion derived without evidence . it is only based on what is seen in an instant , not what is seen through time . you just proved my point that there is a preconcieved notion . it has been taught to you . ( at least , i seriously doubt you have gone out and observed something evolving first - hand ) . constant mutation in every generation is not something observed . it still would not account for the extreme specificity of nylon . again , the chances of - a random mutation allowing multiple ( i assume there was more than 1 survivor ) organisms to digest a synthetic material that happens to be dumped where they are - are very much against it quiet the opposite . fossil records give us a snap shoct of location in time going way back . molecular biology , geology , radiography do so as well . where do you get the idea that there is no evidence ? everything we have in our heads is what has been taught to us . shoulder ' s of giants , hun . it is observed . you and i have about one hundred non fatal mutations in our genotype . remember , most mutations are innocuous . not so . only one of a pathogenetic organism needs this and as mutation is pretty common in rappid generation organisms ( bacteria ) situations the ' chances ' are very much in favour of it happening . remember , mutations are happening to every bacteria every generation at random .	0
what i really find disturbing is why you choose to ignore truths and facts . <repeated> did you know that the blacks that were brought here from africa were the criminal and the mentally deranged ? 90% of blacks here today are a product of them . <repeated> think about that for a week . <repeated> have you listened to " gangsta rap " lately ? it is the decay of the 9 0 s . <repeated> of society . <repeated> but they keep getting richer ! <repeated> that is an interesting fact , how come i have never heard such a thing . <repeated> maybe a link is in order and not a stormfront or the like link please . <repeated> actually i have listened to gangsta rap . <repeated> easy e , snoop , <allcaps> nwa </allcaps> , and so many others , in fact they are in my truck right now . <repeated> imagine a redhead " whitey " takes enjoyment in listening to all kinds of music . <repeated> hmm i also have lady smith black mambazo , nat king cole , and while we are at it i have music that i adore from iran , iraq , saudi , turkey and so many i cant list them all . <repeated> whats your point ? i would hardly call rap the decay of the 90 ' s , apparently a lot of people listen if they are making money . <repeated> i wonder if you have a crazy relative somewhere in your past ? maybe that would explain a lot .	1
well , apparently the above 3 posters think iraq and the causes of said war are the most important thing to worry about . sad , but i think they missed your point . i do not see it as what issues is america facing , but what issues are the individual american people facing . in my opinion , the issues most important to the individual person are the same as they have been for thousands of years . food , shelter , security from people and things trying to kill them , and their individual means to obtain these things . just a thought . do you believe the average individual actually has any personal control over providing basic essentials and security ? most individuals exist from proceeds of a ' job ' or government programs and would be lost without one or the other , of which they generally have no actual influence . i find it difficult to accept that the average , individual us citizen has the brain power to be concerned about anything but what ' s on tv . voter apathy of 25% or less participation in municipal elections are a strong indication of individual need to be manipulated as governing powers see fit .	0

fundamental rightsthis relationship of citizen and state is fundamental to democracy . in the words of the u.s. declaration of independence , written by thomas jefferson in 1776 : we hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights , that among these are life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . that to secure these rights , governments are instituted among men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed . more specifically , in democracies , these fundamental or inalienable rights include freedom of speech and expression , freedom of religion and conscience , freedom of assembly , and the right to equal protection before the law . this is by no means an exhaustive list of the rights that citizens enjoy in a democracy , but it does constitute a set of the irreducible core rights that any democratic government worthy of the name must uphold . since they exist independently of government , in jefferson ' s view , these rights cannot be legislated away , nor should they be subject to the whim of an electoral majority . and here our government recognizes : rule of law : fundamental rights of citizens democracies exist to serve their people	0
i would like to add , i do not necessarily agree with the health care reform that obama passed , but i will applaud the fact that he actually passed something concerning health care . all the previous presidents since reagan have promised health care and never delivered . they ran on health care , and once elected did nothing . at least obama kept his promise to address the subject . maybe it could have been a better plan , but what we have now is better than the nothing we have had under mostly republicans . <repeated> clinton being the only democrat who also failed to deliver . <repeated> to be honest , i am surprised it was that hard to give a corporate handout . any big insurance company and big drug company is delighted since their competition will now be squashed and the average joe will delight in their weaker care at a higher price . but hey , a for effort , right ? emoticonxrolleyes you do not get points for failing to deliver or delivering a failure in my opinion .	1
we have already been over this and again you are confusing two separate issues . i think everyone is agreed that people no matter what race are entitled to equal protection under the law . well of course everybody is entitled . but as history has shown many southern states in america chose to ignore the constitution and deny black people their rights on the basis of their skin color , using the " black codes " enacted after the civil war . if it were not for the 1 4 th amendment that forced state governments to abide by the constitution , minorities would still be out in the cold . the only thing we have been over , is that government and gun control is racist , not the second amendment .	0
well , you stated that gun control " worked well " in europe during the 3 0 s , which was the time of the holocaust . by stating gun control " worked well " , i assumed that you supported or condoned what the nazis were doing to the jews . however , i assume i was incorrect . and regarding you and steve <elongated> ' s childish attacks , i will ignore them at the moment , but if you decide to resume this behavior i will be forced to report it . obviously sarcasm escapes you . <repeated> if you did not understand that remark about gun control working in europe during the 1930 ' s . report me ? my knees are trembling already . i believe steeve was expressing his right to free speech .	1

" ( 22 . ) criminals , being the lowlife , deviant scum they are , would never be smart enough to anticipate the possibility that their victims might be armed , and would thus never take along guns themselves . criminals continually inform the public that their greatest fear is a victim capable of fighting back against them and possibly killing them .	0
when we demean the holocaust , and the symbols supporting it , we begin to erase those lessons . so you are saying we should try and forget about it ? learning about the holocaust is great , and as horrible as it sounds it is probably for the better that it happened . why do i say this ? well if it had not happened then it would have happened eventually ( almost everyone hated jews , blacks and homosexuals at the time ) , and it happening taught us a valuable lesson . it ' s horrible to look at it like that ; but it is quite true , whether you think so or not . we need things like this to happen in order to grow and develop and mature as a species . wow , i do not understand how this keeps happening . i will try to switch mice .	1

you should really think about what you say before you say it . i have heard this before and its garbish , i have been around and owned guns my whole life and i have never , not even once , had the thought of getting a gun just because someone # # # # # # me off . i would never use a gun on a person unless that person were a viable threat to my life , such as coming at me with a knife for example . you need to read what people say more thoroughly , and think about it before you respond . when he said " can " ( and there are not many simpler words than that ! ) it did not mean " will " , " must " , or " shall " be more aggressive . it has been shown that in some cases it " <allcaps> can </allcaps> " happen . it may not have happened with you . it still might , we do not know . we might even say that it is not likely to happen , but we can not say that it will not , because sometimes some people do behave more aggressively when they have a gun .	0

no matter what science is out there , even if it spelled out completely that sexuality is genetic . some peoples prejudices will prevail on them . in other words they will never believe it anyway ! what if it ' s got nothing to with bigotry ? what if , like religion , it takes absolute proof in order to be believed ? i think that ' s what it ' s going to take . do not you ?	0
do you have a fire extinguisher in your house ? i have never had a fire in my kitchen but i still keep a fire extinguisher in there . i look at wearing firearms for self defense the same way i look at wearing a seat belt . i wear it and pray i will never need it , but i will be damn glad i am wearing it if i do need it . when ' s the last time you heard of someone being killed by the accidental discharge of a fire extinguisher ? or when the last time a fire extinguisher was stolen from a home and then used in the commission of a crime ? and do not you think the likelihood of being in a car accident is greater than that of being required to shoot someone ?	1
so let me get this straight , you reject global warming , despite there being supported by almost 97% of scientists and is clearly being observed by the melting of glaciers , rise in sea levels , change in weather patterns , etc . but you believe in a magical genie in the sky that grants your wishes ? people like you are gonna get us all killed , keep your stupid superstitions to yourself and please , if you ever have any children , dont spread this bull , ok ? thank you oh dear she ' s attacking everyone now obviously a very unhappy kitten . <repeated> and i can not even pray for her . <repeated> and if you can not take tantrum throwing stop doing it , try work on that new word you have invented or your punctuation and spelling , or print up your global warming theory prove all them science folk wrong . <repeated> may even get a noble prize ( beats beauty school ) . <repeated> go get them tiger . <repeated> , .	1
go do your own homework . i am not busting my butt for a certified christ - denier who never admits anything when information is provided . figure it all out yourself . i already have , hence the explanation i provided . if you challenge me to show you an error then i will . did you expect me to try and show something that was true and see if i could convince you it wasn ' t ? when you post your evidence it usually has holes in it , not always but the truth is funny that way . it is very difficult sometimes to cover it up . and stay away from those shrimp , eagles , gays and snowmenthey are all abominations .	1
i put to you that you are the one discriminating on the basis of someone ' s size and development , since you would have it that a small , slightly developed person has a right to inhabit a womb , while a fully grown adult does not . this is not discrimination because the adult once did have have the right to live in a womb until it could live otherwise . once out of the womb and living on his / her own this right has been exhausted because there is no need to be living in the womb . much like you can drive but this ' right ' is exhausted when you are drunk or too old to see anything .	0
said repeal would have to be signed by the president , right ? i trust you have not forgoten who currently holds that position , or how likely his signature would be ? you may have missed the context from the other thread i referred to . the point i made is that the unlikeliness of a presidential signature did not stop senator obama from voting in favor of a required iraq troop withdraw timetable . the promised veto threat did not matter in this instance . he was " standing on principle .

the mentally disabled are not able to drive . they depend on level - headed , indiscriminate folks like you and i to do that . <repeated> and most everything else for that matter . do not forget who depends on whom . i wonder what that wonder was ? hmm <elongated> . <repeated> well , it depends on your definition of retarded i guess . the standards to get a drivers license are really not that high . think of how dumb the average person is , and realize that 50% of people are dumber than that . kinda makes you cringe . and you wonder what has prevented me from being in an accident ? well , perhaps the fact that i am a concientious , defensive , and skilled driver who excercises caution while on the road . maybe next time someone pulls out in front of me , i should just throw my hands in the air and scream " take the wheel jesus ! " i am sure some magical being will fly down from heaven and save me from crashing . yeah . <repeated> sure .	0
then you got the benefits of being a weed addict like all you can do is have weed addict friends because you do not have time for anything else . now this is a totally inaccurate generalization . i do not think you actually realize the sheer numbers of people who smoke pot in this country , and i am talking on a regular basis . i am certainly one of them . i have friends that do it and friends that do not . we all lead your typical normal life .	0

in regards to who wrote these books , the best evidence we have leads to homer . therefore , we decide it is almost certainly homer who is the author . this is undisputed . nonsense . the most widely accepted idea is that these epics were oral traditions that were finally recorded in writing , possibly by a guy named homer . read and read .	0
you sure can . a mass murder of at least 13 children was committed with a knife . that has happened before even in japan as well as other countries including here . no conclusion to be drawn . it happened , it is history and now a well known fact . you do not even take into consideration the possibility that japan could have a higher mass murder rate - perhaps the same as the us - if guns were freely available in that country . you have a lot of explaining to do if you expect me to buy what you are trying to peddle .	0

two general observations : 1 : must you use the pejorative " tea bagger ? " or does the simple mention of the term somehow convey some mystical argument defeating power ? 2 : regardless of how unsavory the means i do not think desperation prompted grave robbing equates to asking for a handout . presumably the pilgrims merely took a page from your playbook , declared keeping warm to be a " right " and simply cut out the gubment middleman . after rump limpballs and his <allcaps> x <elongated> </allcaps> followers started calling me a " feminazi " , i was granted a license to call teabaggers teabaggers .	1

you should use the entire quote rather than cut to attempt to prove what you aare about . " when defending yourself in australia you must use equal force . this means you must use the <allcaps> same </allcaps> weapon as the criminal . so no baseball bat v knife . once you locate the same weapon as the armed criminal has you must then use reasonable force to bring him down . this means you are <allcaps> not </allcaps> allowed to kill him and once he is down you are not allowed to touch him again . now if you have 2 criminals both with different weapons you must use the weapon one has on that one then change for the other . the catch 22 is if he has a gun you are screwed as using any weapon to defend yourself is <allcaps> illegal </allcaps> . " comprende ? you should use the same quote when whining about use of partial quotes , and not introduce different ones . nozza made a false assertion and was refuted with his own words . you introduce a different false assertion and fail . epically .	1
stabbing yourself is not ok , but that does not mean it should be illegal . i am not even going to bother with your non - sequitor , but i imagine plenty of alcohol manufacturers enjoy the occasional drink . of course guns are only used to hurt others by criminals - shooting someone is a criminal act . unfortunately by the time you find out that the person is a criminal their victim is bleeding out on the floor . illegal guns are generally guns that were previously held legally , whether they have been modified or stolen . [ quote = jo bennett ; 314232 ] stabbing yourself is not ok , but that does not mean it should be illegal . i am not even going to bother with your non - sequitor , but i imagine plenty of alcohol manufacturers enjoy the occasional drink . these are mostly caused by illegal guns . you can not outlaw something thats already illegal . i highly doubt this . how can a gun be illegal when it used to be legal ? most illegal guns are bought off the black market .	0

it is much more important that you concern yourself with the destiny of your soul , not how many years you can stay on the earth . i am sure it is many a doctors ' spiritual duty to relieve suffering , just as jesus healed the sick . besides , who wants to go back to 40 year average lifespan , like they have in afghanistan ? not me .	1
[ brain size is relevant compared to the rest of the body - its the proportions that matter . if you are small then you can have a smaller brain , this contradicts evolutionists ' position . they have long measure brain size and correlated it with intelligence . take homo erectus , for example . evolutionists have long said homo erectus was some sort of sub - human because of the size of his brain . it does not matter that turkana boy was short at about 5'5 and 10 - 13 years old - - and that his head size did not look proportionally small - - today ' s scientists do not care about any of that . they just measure his skull . and compare that to an equivalent sized human - if you compared the skill to a 10 - 13 year old boy , the erectus skeleton ' s cranial capacity would be significantly smaller . does not contradict in the slightest other than the bizarre positions you decide other people should hold .	0

i am offering any of you creationists , christians , etc , the chance to prove me wrong . of course , to have this chance , you must also accept that i have full ability to argue with you . i used to be a christian , but after extensive studying and questioning , threw it away . do not talk to me unless you have a somewhat open mind to argue things . my aim is pikeman852003 my icq is 117686925 my msn is <email> if you want to argue with me , add me . i will argue with anyone who wants to , but be advised , when i argue with people , i often make them question things they had never thought of . i have convinced several people to severly question or even give up their faith using reasoning and facts . argue with me at your own risk . i originally posted this on the old forums , then learned they were obsolete . i believe that evolution is a perfectly logical idea . ( from the science point of view ) all humans are traced to monkeys from africa . from there they spread throughout the world . if it is not evolution , then why do humans from high elevations have larger lungs ? how come africans have a darker skin tone ? how come humans from cold regions have a thicker coat of hair ? i doubt it is coinsidental , and no offense , but i dont think that a god did this for us . every person has a subconscience . in this subconscience we think of lesser facts . does that mean that it is possible for the subconscience to create the genetic material used for reproduction a way to survive better ? i believe so .	0

define evil . the concept of evil is very subjective . if something is truly evil , then there must be an absolute concept of evil . but you will never come to agreement with everyone else in the world as to what makes something truly evil or good . what is your standard for determining what is evil ? yes , it ' s very subjective . i was using evil as an example that was incorrectly used on the website . even though evil is subjective , you can still be evil .

how is it not , there is one defining moment in life : the fertilization , after that there is nothing were fingers snap and its a baby . it is a human . do you realize , that the fetus has only recently not been defined as a human being . back when birth control first came out , planed parenthood wanted to make sure it would be leagle . so they redefined ' life ' to say that you had to draw breth . by the way have you ever seen any pictures of the aborted babies ?

happygrl35 , the premise from the man ' s perspective is the same arguement pro - choicers argue , all they are doing is legally terminating a mass of tissue , not a human being . according to pro - choicers , life is not conceived at conception , so if i man after having sex with a woman and the woman becomes pregnant , she is not pregnant with a baby , she is pregnant with a cell that can " develop " into a baby . if a man say ' s i opt out of fatherhood prior to the development of a human being , then he too like the woman already has , should have the opt - out option . a woman can do with her body what she so chooses , like she does , however , everyone including women must mitigate their own damages . if a woman who is pregnant with a few " cell clusters " and she so chooses to let the pregnancy of cells develop into a human being , she is allowed to do so , but she caused the development of a human baby not the man , and should be solely liable for such creation . remember , when the man left after having sex , he did not create a human being according to pro - choicers , if at most he created a " cell " . according to pro - choicers , cells do not translate into a human life . a male should have an opt - out period just like the woman , before the cells become a <allcaps> human being </allcaps> . emoticonxhoho god , i love it . pro - choicers do not even want to live by their own words . i am trying to understand their position . its a " cluster of cells " , " a mass of tissue " , " not a human being " , " no heartbeat " " no brainwave therefore , not a human being yet " , so if a man say ' s i opt out of fatherhood prior to the creation of a human being then , like his female counterpart , should be able terminate his parental duty , that he never created , she did . he and she only created a cell not a human . first of all a man cannot terminate tissue he is not carrying . the father can opt out all he wants but when that fetus becomes a born person he is responsible just like the mother is .	1
you snipped most of my remarks because you were unable to address them . you have no answers and have been reduced to insult . that means that you have lost the discussion and you know you have lost . otherwise you would attempt meaningful answers . actually , i snipped your remarks because 1 ) you twisted what i said and 2 ) i am already spending too much time arguing with random complainers and i was in a hurry to do something more important at the time .	0

the california judge would probably not have the authority to refer to the federal constitution ; it would have to be taken to the federal courts for that . state courts can rule based on state and / or federal law . in this case , the answer was found in the state constitution , so the judge did not need to pursue the issue further . also , a state constitution can offer more protection that the federal one , as long as , in so doing , it does not contradict the federal constitution .	0

this is actually simply a place for intelligence to prevail , and for unsupported ideas to be hacked down like hogs hung from a meat hook . if christianity is a worthy religion , it will stand the test of extreme scrutiny . history will support it and the text inside the bible will always speak the truth about society , and how god wants us to live ( assuming there is a god , that he directed the writing of the bible , and that he put in the bible what he wanted his creations to do / how to live their lives ) . wow , so you are saying that christianity should be able to stand the test of extreme scrutiny ? are you trying to use this as an excuse to bash it time and again ? great idea ! i think you should spread the wealth a little ! bash some hindus and buddhists and jews ! oh , wait - no that is discrimination ! <repeated> you racist ! i think that christianity has definitely should the test of extreme scrutiny long enough ! millions of christians have been killed in history as martyrs .	1
most schools also have rules regarding the age of those who can attend prom , ie . no freshman or dates over 20 , should we end that discrimination as well ? what right was she standing up for exactly ? the right to violate dress code ? right to ignore the prom rules ? obviously the rest of the prom going students did not want her making their prom into a political statment , what about their wishes ? o <elongated> , the slippery slope argument ! always a classic . the right to not be discriminated against based on her sexual orientation perhaps ? what part of the dress code was she going to violate ? she was going to wear formal wear . it ' s not like she was going to show up in ripped jeans and a slipknot t - shirt . rules designed to exclude her . their wishes do not supersede her rights .	0

what do you think is motivating these scientists to lie to us ? i think that ' s an excellent question . since my area of expertise is chemistry and not climatology , i can only speculate that it ' s a combination of peer pressure , the desire to get funding and their allowing governments to manipulate their findings . there have been several instances in which members of the ipcc have quit amidst claims that the final reports issued did not reflect their research . since the final ipcc reports are reviewed by politicians prior to being published , i am not surprised with the claims made . here ' s a relevent story .	0

you are so entrenched in your own world and nothing outside of it , you would not know the " truth " if came into your face like a lemon meringue pie . this is actually humorous coming from you who has absolutely no concept that you are a spiritual being , or the extra dimension of yourself which that reality means to you . in other words antonia , it is the epitome of self deceit to lie to oneself about who they are . and you define that darkness which is the great lie you represent so completely .	0

wow , is not the point of a bar to drink ? people can be picked up , driven by someone not drinking , or use other transportation ( if they live close , walk , maybe public transportation ) . it is horribly wrong when we start arresting people because they " might " commit a crime . with a standing president breaking the law to ' protect ' you , this should be expected .	1
why am i not surprised at such an answer . people with no common sense nor the ability or desire to recognize the obvious need someone else to tell them what to think . you people can remain in denial of reality but we have hundreds of thousands of bars and clubs , both straight and gay throughout this country , and they are all packed to overflowing 5 out of 7 nights a week , every week of the year . if you actually think that the vast majority are there just for a drink with friends then you explain why we have millions of abortions each year by mostly single unattached women ? where are they all getting pregnant genius , in church , at work and in school ? emoticonxgood why am i not surprised at your lack of a response to my point ? why am i not surprised that you are supplying no evidence ? and there are millions of bedrooms with people gettin ' busy inside , too . can we rail against those as well ? in bed , with their partners . you are married and you still do not know where this generally happens ?	1

i have seen these debates and granted mine are not the best debates and may just be plain and simple retarded but my answers match the question . at least i think they do . but all you have to do is skip right over them . darling , you are too sensitive . i have never had an issue with your debates . it was a parody of some of the new ones out . you have probably seen them , they ask a question then give yes , because and no , because for the answers when they are clearly not a question that can be answered yes or no . if i had a problem with yours , i ' d be enough of a friend to kindly point it out . again , you are cool with me , do not worry . edit : i see where you have seen what i was referring to . it ' s early here and i am not yet awake . but i have to get crank - started and get ready for class .	0
no , they are the same species . if you put all these fish in the same pool at the end they would all breed with each other . the example wasn ' t of speciation , merely of a change in a population driven by the environment , which is the essense of evolution . agreed that they are still the same species , much like the " 13 species " of darwin ' s finches , and i have no problem with evolution in that respect . i can even see the plausibility of different subspecies evolving eventually into different species if they are geographically separated for a sufficiently long time . but i still do not see where evolution , in that sense of the term , can account for dozens of species of monkeys occupying the same patch of rainforest , or dozens of species of gazelles occupying the same patch of grassland .	0
well , answering you seems to be a waste of time . you ignore / reject any attempts at explaining the things you clearly do not understand , and youlater bring up the exact same things that you have had explained to you as if the subject was never broached before . you are incorrigible and uneducable . well if i do not get an answer here i will just spread it around the whole internet . fine with me .	1
in re : the jefferson claim . <repeated> it ' s true that he proposed castration for ' buggery . ' but . <repeated> considering that colonial scientists were as ignorant of sexual orientation as the ancient israelites , it ' s not surprising they drafted such a draconian punishment for homosexuality . jefferson ' s suggestion , however , was merciful by comparison . and we also know that , having revised the bible by editing out all the supernatural events ( including , especially , the resurrection ) and having referred to paul ( author of the nt ' s allegedly anti - homosexual ' clobber ' passages ) as ' the great coryphaeus . <repeated> the first corruptor of the doctrines of jesus , ' that he would likely have been repelled by with archangel ' s views , on both god and homosexuality . in fact , it ' s probable , given his devotion to science and reason , that had he known then what our doctors and scientists know now about human sexuality he likely would not have gone so far as condoning so harsh an alternative as castration . exactly who are you saying has revised the bible ? and with that question asked , i believe by admitting that if it was revised to delete the meat of it , it would be equally diluted in power , content and strength . really ? if you are speaking about jefferson still , then why did not he recommend that all punishments for homosexuality be erased from the law completely , and homosexuality be legalized at that time ? that would have been the just and magnanimous thing to do if he believed such tripe as you attribute to him .	0
and , if you were given that evidence , in what way would that change your opinion of homosexuality ? i believe i said i would change my view . i will change my view on the issue of whether homosexuality is genetic .	0

bestiality commiters will possibly make similar arguments , since their logic is about the same ( i . e . , not illegal , not hurting anyone else ) , and there will be no surprise if people could marry their pets in the future . but bestiality consists of animal cruelty , so very much hurts another . just not another human .	0
no , but abiogenesis does , and they are 2 sides of the same coin as they are presented as one process following the other . it is so deceptive and disingenuous to constantly separate them as unique processes while all the time knowing that one study is the scientific continuation where the other ends . you are playing a game of semantics in order to claim they are not connected while all the while knowing that one study directly and specifically follows the other and build upon its claims as it continues on the explanation of how life evolved from single celled life forms . so stop with the denial and word games and face the truth for once in your life . i know i am presenting facts to archie , sorry . <repeated> archie , in point of fact you have it backwards . the theory of evolution was first , then abioegenesis . we know life exists . darwin , and others , explained how life changed from what it used to be to what it is now ; they had no concern for where it came from in the first place , they simply knew that it came from somewhere . how did they know it came from somewhere ? because there ' s life here now ! the answer to the question of where it all started did not get seriously studied until well after darwin . so no , the one does not pick up from the other , and the study of evolution does not in any way depend on abiogenesis . evolution does not care where life came from , only what happens to it once it ' s around .	1

i think the risk from the christian right is less the theocracy , but that they will stifle scientific development and education to the degree that the us loses its major asset , innovation . we are already seeing this with regard to stem cell research . this is not to say that ethics should be disregarded in science , far from it , but if the us raises a generation of kids who think science is satanic then the possibilities for development are going to be slim . nonsense . just look at all the great things that the dark ages did for europe !	1

yeah if we could get a good portion of the pro - life people on our side we might stand a pretty good chance of significantly decreasing the amount of abortions . our side ? i do not get the impression we are on the same side . besides , i think the subject is decreasing the number of unwanted pregnancies .	0
well said jito . i do not understand why pro - lifers dismiss pregnancy as easy and / or suggest that it ' s a wonderful snuggly thing that ' s just the best thing in the world . even if you want a baby , it ' s unbelievably hard to go through and something your body never fully recovers from . if you do not want a baby and are being forced to go through it , it ' s unbearable . you can not force somebody to go through this life - threatening condition that is always physically harmful . ' life threatening condition that is always physically harmful " ? what a giant load of steamy bs . rarely is pregnancy physically harmful and even rarer is it life threatening . there are over 6 billion people on this earth today . if motherhood was so damn dangerous , do not you think the population would be a lot lower , even if it was just due to mothers keeling over after giving birth ? where do you get this bs from , planned parenthood ?	1
still , i do not feel that percentage likelyhood of a lasting marriage is a good reason to allow or disallow marriage . it is a standard which we hold no other group to , just as we should not hold it to same - sex couples . i disagree . well , only in that i think it ' s high time we held everybody to a higher standard . we should suspend hetero marriage until they clean up their act !	1
personally i do not believe in abortion . it ' s morally wrong and i think it ' s good that it ' s illegal . i think often abortion is wrong but i do not agree with criminalizing it . primarily the reasons that are used to justify criminilzation are hugely fallacious and secondarily because it will not do a thing that is positive . a woman who is determined to end her pregancy - will . criminalization will simply make it extremely dangerous . i am responsible , have even had my tubes tied , but if i were to become pregnant and that pregnancy were the result of rape or a threat to my health or livlihood i would end it - and i will not be checking the law books first . every woman has her line in the sand - abortion will go on regardless of its legal standing . there are a miriad of reasons seek abortion - comdemning those reasons does nothing ( i . e . calling them selfish ) - addressing them could help . the reasons are valid .	0
they would say that you were not a real christian as well . that all it takes is to believe , or accept christ into their lives in order to be " saved " . and since they are the majority that would make you and your kind heretics . anybody got a match and a stake ? <happy> well , the antichrist is going to come and make any true believer a heretic any way so what am i worried about ? i knew the risks before i accept the job . <happy>	1
well for the most part dou you are flawed indeed . you see we are already fighting a war . like i said we cannot solve all the worlds problems , we just need to be there for others less fortunate than ourselves . so would not that cover almost all of africa ? there are so many people dying in the city streets of hunger in our own country , yet we elect a president who wants to address a problem in iraq rather than our own country ? if we truly tried to help all those less fortunate than ourselves , we would be helping africa a lot more than we are now ( their average life expectancy is like 30 ) . yes iraq was terrible , but guess what , other countries might think our country is terrible . that is not our concern and at least we could wait until we fixed all of our own problems first . we have poor hungry starving people on the streets of the us and we go to another country to solve their problems ?	0
what i would like to see is a rather antiquated method of community . have all the destroyed housing areas razed and bulldozed to level , bare soil , then have massive ' barn - raising ' house building , where the people ( in that area ) pitch in to rebuild each others houses ( and build theirs ) . it ' s somewhat like habitat for humanity too , with the difference being all neighbors pitch in . sh <elongated> . . . do not tell anyone : habitat for humanity is a religious ( <allcaps> gasp </allcaps> ) organization . those mean old hateful christians - - helping giving homes to needy people . . .	1
your the dufus , dongbonce . it was you and pappy that said because gay marriage was not mentioned in the bble it meant god approved it . <repeated> just as he approved marrying animals and cannibalism eh ? i said that god obviously approves of marriage between man and woman but condemns gay sex acts . as there are no gay marriages in the bible and god condemns gay sex acts it would take a complete x <elongated> to think that he would approve of gay marriage . <repeated> and you are that complete ( and utter ) x <elongated> . you are correct it is you that is the imbecile . <repeated> i apologiseemoticonxclown i know your position exactly . <repeated> head up backside and x <elongated> in your eyes . <repeated> thats why you cant read properly . <repeated> christianphobeemoticonxchicken uh . no . that is not what he said . why do you misrepresent what he said ? why are you lying so much ? every time you lie like that , jesus kills a kitten .	1

tsk tsk . on the iidb board , you insisted that if an animal was transplanted to a different environment , you would expect it ' s phenotype to change in response to that environment within ' a few ' generations . a few is generally taken to be around three ( much less than 12 anyways . that is what we call ' a dozen ' ) . oh , and strawman , again , does not mean what you think it means . please answer my question . i would never limit myself in a debate to ' how many ' generations it takes because the fact is your scientists are afraid to test such things . in the following example it took between 7 and 18 generations for guppies to change their phenotypes . <url> of course these guys , being evolutionsts explain this phenomenon as happening through natural selection - - death . but what have we already learned about tadpoles ? <repeated> - - they develop in direct relation to their predators . <repeated> including body structure . fish are no different .	0

actually , " evolutionism " does have meaning , but not in biology anymore . biologists stopped using it over 100 years ago . from wikipediasome important concepts ( and why the word no longer has meaning in biology ) is the concept of an intrinsic need to improve . such concepts were discredited with darwin . as is pointed out , opponents of evolution use the word in a disparaging way in order to reduce science to religion on a level with " creationism " . while " creationism " is a belief in mythology based on no evidence , no one " believes " in evolution . evolution consists of observations that are explained by the theories of evolution . exactly , which brings us back to square 1 . creationism is based on religion , and evolution is based on the scientific method , but is not proven . creationism isnt even near being proven . so , why would you try to impose your religious beliefs on public school children ?	0
i do not believe in any gods because like you said there ' s nobody who can prove they exist . there ' s no evidence to support any supernatural things so therfore the only logical conclusion is to not accept them . thus i am not convinced fair enough . i tend to run skeptic . i am surprised that i am a theist . if you were to believe in a god , which would it be ?	0

nope , your argument fails again . nothing in the heller ruling suggests that gun rationing laws are constitutional in nature . at best heller was simply saying that the individual rights nature of the second amendment does not automatically rule all gun control null and void . but then again nobody was really expecting it to . the details of what is allowable and what is not have not been hammered out yet . but i would love to see you try and explain how 30 months in prison , a felony conviction record , and $5,000 in fines for buying two guns in one month is fair , reasonable , tough on crime , and constitutional in nature . go ahead and try . we will wait . what is conveniently missing from your response ? an explanation of why a limit on the number of guns that can be purchased during a certain time period is not a law which imposes " conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms " per heller . if the punishment does not fit the crime it does not necessarily follow that the crime is constitutionally protected . executing someone for shoplifting would be unjustifiable . however , that does not mean that there is a constitutional right to shoplift .	0

you will have to specify which argument . my response was to your question " can religious views be logical ? " i posted two versions : 1 . i am a rational being . is it logical to assume that a rational entity formed me ? ( not my parents - - on a mankind scale ) is it more logical than to assume that i generated out of inanimate matter incapable of logic ? generated due to " miraculous " odds ? i am not sure what the numbers are . i think the logical sequence is a belief in a higher power rather than a springboard to logic from a primordial soup of nothing . 2 . i came up with a belief in the supernatural via natural logic - - i am a rational being . i could not have therefore come from irrational combinations of inanimate matter that somehow combined to form rational animate matter . i came from a rational source .	0

so , in other words , you an intelligent actor weed out the programs that do not look like anything that resembles a living thing . then you keep building up on the programs that look most like life . you are the creator of this cyber - universe ! so much for ' natural ' selection ! well yes that ' s what he did , but he did not try to present this as positive evidence for anything . the biomorphs were used to illustrate the point that random mutations are much more likely to produce beneficial results when the mutations are small . analogies always break down at some level , this analogy was used to illustrate a certain point . the assertion that dawkins was suggesting that a biomorph happening to look like a real life object were proof that evolution and natural selection could produce such creatures is false . montalban , to restore integrity i suggest you retract the conclusion you drew from snippets and quotes from dawkins as your paraphrasing was clearly not representative of dawkins ' ideas .	0

becuase the thread is primarily focused on the initial outbreak and spread of aids in the us , and to say there is no connection between that outbreak and spread and sexuality either demonstrated that you are either completely and totally ignorant of the facts , or you have utterly blinded yourself in the name of political correctness . is this what jpsartre meant ? at any rate , to say that there were large numbers of gay men , being infected in the u . s . , is not saying there is a connection between aids or its spread and homosexuality in itself . there is a connection when there is active sexuality , gay or straight , and aids is a sexually transmitted disease . we actually do not know who patient zero was . what is the point of saying initially it affected much larger numbers of gay men , and fewer heterosexuals , to the best of our available knowledge ? this is a disease , and unknowingly spreading it , no matter who you are , is not murder . the fact that much more transmission was initially occuring in a certain group , who had sex among that group , before that group knew it existed and what it was and how to prevent it ; that would also not be murder .	0

as a matter of fact , i find those to be a <allcaps> huge </allcaps> turn off . if i wanted a penis , i ' d be with a man . i do not want a penis , i want what i have . my wonderful , loving female partner . who is my emotional equal , my life partner , my best friend and my worst critic . and trust me , there is no man who could ever make me feel the way she does . what part of " i do not want a penis " do you not quite understand ? is it that maybe you are the one who wants a penis ? there are ways to resolve that issue . emoticonxrolleyes	1
i doubt you have any . <repeated> it is not like this is the first time this has come up . so lets see it . it is essential to your argument so you need to provide it . and you just assume the evidence relates to the fact ? perhaps you assume the evidence tested is tested in methods are in reality logical . you beg the question no matter how you look at it which is why you have to have faith in something . well , many definitions of the word fact . i think it is useless to argue this . a fact can just mean ' a truth that exists ' or it can be a ' something known to exist ' . <repeated> so , whatever . human ( n ) : 1 . a member of the genus homo and especially of the species h . sapiens . 2 . a person is the embryo not of species homo sapien ? perhaps you were home schooled since you are so oblivious to the truth , and probably flunked science a couple of times : <url> <url> <url> <url> fact listen : [ fkt ] n . knowledge or information based on real occurrences : an account based on fact ; a blur of fact and fancy . a . something demonstrated to exist or known to have existed : genetic engineering is now a fact . that chaucer was a real person is an undisputed fact . see above . <url> a piece of my hair is of the homo sapein species too . does that mean my hair is a person ? perhaps you need to get your ' facts ' straight .	1

err , no correction necessary , i just felt like saying enrapture . no the dooms - day will not be on the arrival of the asteroid , that has nothing to do with it , the dooms - day event will be a terrible event , even for the innocents , wrong on both accounts . emoticonxgood oh do tell us of this dooms day event , will we need new nike sneakers and $1.75 in our pocket when we all die ?	1
if god made everyone for heterosexual sex , why did he make people who find heterosexuality distasteful , who find those of their own sex attractive . did god make a mistake ? was god wrong ? thats why i say my gayness is his gift and blessing to me . there is nothing more joyous then gay sex .	1
we are legally dead when we no longer mentally exist ( hence the term " brain - dead " ) , so there is no logical reason to set the beginning point as anything other than the start of the mental existence . just as people who are dead and without mental existence do not have the ability to obtain rights , a collection of human cells without a mental existence cannot obtain rights . this assumes brain - dead is a logical choice to consider one dead . even so , it proves nothing about when life begins . what says they have to be the same ? this is a classic example of a conclusion not following from the premise .	0
. <repeated> god does not fill the word " who " because to most accounts he is not a person , or being . <repeated> a being is something that is conceivable as existing . <repeated> or something that actually exists . a human being is one of us , a homo - sapien , a member of the group of beings known as animals . a rock is a being of inanimate qualities . god is the supreme being , not capable of being understood totally as this would put him ( or it , or she ) on the same level as those that he created . we will never be able to define exactly what or who god is ! god is great . god is good . let us thank him for our food . god is my shepherd . god is my light . god is my co - pilot . god is what keeps me from believing that all this ( the totality of all things and happenings ) came about by accident . when god made man , she was only kidding ! <wink>	0
well , latest word is that the alphabet soup is taking the threat seriously . that is strange the last i read bin laden absolutely hates the regime in iran , mainly becasue iran is run by the shia and bin laden is a sunni . so iran should be held accountable for actions of bin laden ? it seems like before ( iraq ) people are trying to conjure up links between the real terrorist threat ( aq ) and unrelated nation .	0
studies have shown that nordic and specific middle european countries that provide protection and rigerous sex education as well as local information about planned parent hood and the birthcontrol pill have a teenbirthrate of 1% where i believe ours is something like 17% . seems kind of convincing . i think our culture is going to play a big role in this as well . i think that is where the majority of this problem lies .	0
because it is unjust . that is my ideal . i do not want anyone to have to suffer injustice , however if one group is going to pass laws they need to make sure they are subject to those laws . everyone can commit murder and be subjected to murder laws . only women have abortions so to have men decide what happens is unjust . i could have labeled my post " <allcaps> trap </allcaps> " and you would not notice . tell me , are these two contradictory :	1
in my post i presented several reasons as to why they should have changed . <repeated> everything from a changed environment down to genetic drift . they have changed . for example , ancient examples of coelacanth were shallow water species , while the modern coelacanth is a deep marine species ( actually , two or three species ) . and the differences are enough to put them in different families . by the way , ark guy , what do you know about taxonomy ?	0

i think the crazy came first and the zealootry is just a symptom . i see <allcaps> ocd </allcaps> and mania is zealotry . obssessiveness is not healthy - regardless of what your obsessing over . also , one needs to be careful about the lable . for example , nt everyone who opposes gay marriage for religious reasons is a zealout . i would say most are not . take easy and jp . both have religious reasons for opposing gay marriage ( that should not be the problem of anyone outside their faith , but i digress . <repeated> ) , however i would only call easy a zealot . jp may be an occasionally obnoxious conservative apologist who can even teeter on redneck from imie to time , but he is no zealout . i am a redneck because , unlike you , i believe in self - determination ? ! <repeated> emoticonxwow	1

<allcaps> how often </allcaps> do you see people change their minds based on somebody fighting for " gay rights " ? i have seen it , but it ' s only a handful of times . out of <allcaps> hundreds </allcaps> of people i have talked to , it ' s only a " handful of times " . suppose democrats do pick up the gay banner hard and heavy . full gusto . what ' s the effect ? i seriously expect minimal . this is going to be a battle over time . gays got sodomy laws overturned , and the reaction was anti - gay marriage laws and amendments . the <allcaps> simplest </allcaps> thing , that should have been the most obvious to everyone , of sodomy laws overturned got a " anti - gay marriage law / amendment " reaction . these fights <allcaps> are being </allcaps> picked and chosen . <allcaps> roflmao </allcaps> ! no . we fundamentally disagree there . how long have you been arguing the gay marriage issue . and you state that you <allcaps> support </allcaps> equality on every issue with only the gay marriage hold - out , right ? if <allcaps> your </allcaps> mind can not be changed in all that time , why do you think that we could win over the nation just by having democrats come out hot and heavy . furthermore , <allcaps> think </allcaps> about it . <allcaps> how long </allcaps> have we been pushing for <allcaps> enda </allcaps> . <repeated> and we just tried the vote , and it failed . <repeated> <allcaps> even on the issue that has overwhelming majority support </allcaps> , the anti - gays are able to stop the win . what do you think will happen on an issue we <allcaps> do not </allcaps> have majority support on ? well , all i can say then is that no action is just about as bad as failed action , and is as bad in terms of anything current . either way you do not have gay marriage . you have a majority in congress right now , and you are not demanding much change just because of fear of backlash ? yeah , there would be backlash . heck , the civil war was the ultimate backlash , but that did not stop abolitionists from demanding more than <allcaps> token </allcaps> change , and it ' s a good thing they did . it ' s your gig , though , so do what you want . i do not see much point in laboring this discussion any more ; i am just pointing out my observations .	0

since posts are disappearing anyway , let me add a new one . now we all know that i am made in the image and likeness of god and since god is perfect , that image and likeness must also be , as a logical consequence , perfect . to state less would mean that god is not perfect . so if i am the image and likeness of god , then either i am perfect or god is not . think of it as a photocopy of a check for a million dollars . yes the copy is in the image and likeness of the original check , but it is not the check . you cannot cash the photocopy , regardless of how accurate the copy is , it is not the check , only an image of it . that does not mean anything is " wrong " with the original , and it doesnt mean that the copy has to have all the properties and function of the original . its just an image	0
newsweek screwed up . newsweek should be punished by the world court for inciting riots and causing deaths with a fraudulent story . did you even notice that they were not the first to report it ? oh wait , you did not because you are obviously using the fallacy of selective observation .	1
please do not neglect the importance of this question since it lies at the very heart of the pro - life view of the beginning of human rights . if you want women to give up their rights to their own bodies because of the significance of this transition ( i . e . conception ) , then it is critically important that you detail what it is in the transition that makes it so significant . well we assume a right to your own body here . it is also important for you to justify why there should be a difference in human and person and then justify why doing so this time is different from when this was previously done in history . i guess i do not agree with the idea that you have no rights until you can prove you should have them . <repeated> if this is the standard then we are all in trouble .	0

ok , no one said that i would look to a large govt for anything . if individuals are better suited to solve environmental problems , i ' d love to hear some of these solutions . this is why i started this thread , because the info out there is far from satisfactory . can you please explain how private individuals would , say , reduce co2 emissions from automobiles ? or , maybe , protect an area that has been deemed a toxic waste dump from leaking toxins into the soil ? or protect a certain species of bird or marsupial ( some forest - dwelling creature ) from having his habitat destroyed by logging , endangering the survival of the species ? can you offer any libertarian solutions to the other problems i cited above ? you are assuming a need to reduce it because government , or a special interest , requests it . if enough people want it reduced , their demands of manufacturers and buying habits will reduce it . deemed by whom ? the government , or a special interest ? who cares about the species ? the majority of individuals , or the government , or a special interest ? if the majority does not consider them problems , then no solutions are necessary .	0
i do not think that there are any marriage rights for anyone gaurenteed by the constitution . i believe that if marriage is offered to heteros , and they seem to think it is their right to get married , then marriage must be extended equally to gay people . i believe that one group using their religion as a basis to form laws that violate another groups religious freedom , with govenment support , violates the constitution . so , i guess you did not get the memo that this country was <allcaps> founded </allcaps> on christian / judaic beliefs . remember : you do have rights ; to an extent .	0

1 d . a union between two persons having the customary but usually not the legal force of marriage : a same - sex marriage . this is not to say that every current dictionary includes such a definition . <repeated> yet . <repeated> but a number of major on - line ones demonstrably do , and to my knowledge human civilization has yet to suffer any negative effects .

well then you are out of luck . people are not going to stop standing up for what they believe in , and doing what they think is right . any more than gay pride proponents would stop . because they are not the ones out trying to make society change its standards , matt . you are . once again when is my life , what i do , and who i love , who i marry , any more thier business then theirs is to me ? you still have not answered my question . why do they get a say in my life yet i do not get the same say in their lives ? anyone who wants to but into other peoples lives in the way these religious x <elongated> are is just cruel and evil . it is my life my family not theirs . they get theirs yet try and stop me from having mine that is unjust . you are defending an unjust system .	0

if it was anybody i was choose adult stem cells . my whole point is that adult stem cells work and embryonic cells do not . well , then why are the doctors trying 2 also test the embyonic cells ? what ' s their reason then ? we do not know , because the doctors might not want everything that they are doing be on the front page of every newspaper . they have their reasons for their actions , and they just do not want people like you to know about them . or . <repeated> they already have their reasons published and everything and you are just 2 close - minded 2 take the information in .	1
when nature says no or maybe to your hypothesis during empirical testing , that is more than pure reason . it ' s an objective test independent of human reason . that ' s why the only one endlessly circling this corpse of an argument is you . an objective test ? wow ! tell me , how do you prove this test is a true useful test ? please do not tell me reason or yet another objective test .	1
you are missing the bigger picture . i do not see the conflict , <allcaps> biblically speaking </allcaps> . because in the kingdom of god there is also judgment . ever read about the israelis coming under judgment and being enslaved by the babylonians ? why did that happen to them ? <allcaps> because they did not love god and their neighbors as themselves </allcaps> . they broke the law of love . god did not break it , they did . so , because they hated and did not turn from their wicked ways , they came under judgment . and if you read the book of judges , that usually humbles the people and turns their hearts back to god . that ' s why i say there is no conflict . god ' s economy makes sense . ah <elongated> i see so god was more than willing to use extreme punishment for not loving your neighbor . like how sodom and gomorrah were punished for not loving their neighbor .	1
well yes , sarge but at the same time accipiter indicated that we were preventing accipiter and maybe others from having their opinions heard . i was just giving accipiter his first amendment due . we all the time , get treated like we are the enemy , and we do not pay that any attention , because maybe to them , we are . however , it seems to me that when we treat them with the exact same treatment as they treat us , they cry foul ! is it a false claim of trying to claim aggrieved status ? i think so , but i do not want to take the chance that accipiter actually feels that way . so now accipiter has an opening ! me thinks thou dost be too kind . yon creature willst make the false charge in any event . emoticonxkill	1

from what i can tell , no one has ever said gay families can not come to it . that ' s why the whole thing seems odd to me . what ' s with gay lobbyists and stunts like this ? the white house should just make it invitation - only just to keep something like this from becoming a political tool . did you read the artical ? to show our children that they are no different then any other .	0
no , to rag on a gay activist - - because of the hypocrisy . and there are certainly people here who also can not pass up the opportunity to show such hypocrisy with religious activists against gays , and i do not recall you opposing <allcaps> them </allcaps> on that . if you all are going to take glee in hypocrisy of religious activists against gay rights , you might as well realize that what ' s good for the goose is good for the gander . so what are you claiming now ? that all this time that rosie was making fun of the chinese , she ' s actually been chinese all the while ? because that ' s the only legitimate way you could draw a parallel with those people who are hypocritically attacking gays while being gay themselves .	1
while china has more troops , they do not have the equipment to utilize those troops . the chinese may have the largest infantry , but the united states has the most advanced technology , the largest navy , the largest air force , and a lot more purchasing power . 774 billion to china in debt . <repeated> where are you going to ' buy ' new technology ? oh right . <repeated> from china .	1
i thought that crocodiles and alligators were in about the same state as they were millions of years ago and that was because thier habitat did not require them to change therefore the odd slight mutations that gain the advantage and lead to change was of no advantage . right . it ' s called stasis . species that are well adapted to their environments tend to change little in a stable environment . it is still true that fossil crocs are not the same as modern crocs . there are obvious differences .	0
i do not think it ' s fair to put the blame on women who wear explicit clothing . there are times when self control is needed . if a man can not exercise that self control , to a point where he rapes a woman , then he does deserve jail . this is partly right though , women do cause a lot of mixed messages when they go out wearing almost nothing . however , if she says no . <repeated> it means no . and we should not go around blaming the victim of a sexual assault . dear , as i have already said that rape is committed by persons of imbalance minds / or intoxicated persons . so , logically they can not exercise self control ( and that ' s y we call them mentally imbalanced ) . i agree , that if a woman says no , it means no . but , in that state of mind a man can not understand that she is denying , what a rapist thinks is only his sexual gratification . and that ' s y its a crime . and we have punishments for it . <repeated> thank you for ur time . and i appreciate ur views . <repeated>	0
on point , do you disagree that it should be the navy ' s role to make the sea lanes safe for merchant shipping ? yes i disagree with that point . the navy , just like the police , can not possibly be everywhere that danger might raise its ugly head . merchant ships can not afford a 24 / 7 navy escort anymore than the average citizen can afford to hire body guards 24 / 7 . there ' s no legitimate reason why merchant ships should be unarmed and unable to address dangers that deliberately come after them .	0
i was educated in 12 years of catholic school plus 2 years at st josephs univ . in philly so i know my catechism . <repeated> that is what is important to me . <repeated> that ' s nice , but have you ever thought of reading your own religion ' s holy book so that you can intelligently discuss what it is that jesus and his disciples said ?	1
that spiritually - challenged , deluded , lying slug obama could not carry rick ' s jock strap . the only reason obama is even in office is because blacks are voting for a black man and free stuff , hispanics want no borders , and most women do not know or do not care how bad the obama liberals are digging america into the ground financially . and you wonder why people call " republicans " racist , women hating bigots .

false and that does not invalide evolution given how it ' s a misrepresentation of one of the statements in the theory . actually , it ' s true . one darwin ' s basic ideas upon which he based the theory of natural selection .	0
a third or fourth eye is simply a copy of an existing body part . if it ' s a <allcaps> first </allcaps> eye that evolved , then that ' d count . you can not create anything new by creating copies . really . some people would think i am in cahoots with the creationists . i predict their behavior and then they go and do it .	1
if you have noticed , i never point out the flaws in evolution to " make creationism true . " but that is your goal whether you want to admit it or not . and that is your sole way of defending creationism as you have admitted you cannot argue creationism based on its own merits . creationism is wrong independent of evolution . even if you somehow manage to disprove evolution ( along with every science ) you still have to even take a single step towards proving creationism .	0
one of the biggest arguments against gun control is that if the government became too oppressive , the people would not have the capacity to carry out a successful rebellion . of course , if the government was becoming oppressive , it would likely implement gun control , so the absence of gun control is necessary to ensure that we do not take a plunge towards fascism ! not quite . to be more correct regarding government and guns , the right to own weapons is for the right to revolt and revolt with violence . our political philosophy is very clear on this : " that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it " - declearation of independaceyou have the right to try and revolt with violence . you do not have the right to win a revolt .	0

certainly science has provided part of the answer with their finding of the mitachondrial " eve " , suggesting that one person can have all the <allcaps> dna </allcaps> necessary for all the variation in human populations . that is not quite what the ' mitochondrial eve ' hypothesis posits . science . 1995 dec 22 ; 270 ( 5244 ) : 1930 - 6 . the myth of eve : molecular biology and human origins . ayala fj . university of california , irvine , <allcaps> usa </allcaps> . it has been proposed that modern humans descended from a single woman , the " mitochondrial eve " who lived in africa 100,000 to 200,000 years ago . the human immune system drb1 genes are extremely polymorphic , with gene lineages that coalesce into an ancestor who lived around 60 million years ago , a time before the divergence of the apes from the old world monkeys . the theory of gene coalescence suggests that , throughout the last 60 million years , human ancestral populations had an effective size of 100,000 individuals or greater . molecular evolution data favor the african origin of modern humans , but the weight of the evidence is against a population bottleneck before their emergence . the mitochondrial eve hypothesis emanates from a confusion between gene genealogies and individual genealogies .	0
? they are not like puppies or chickens , can not get them fixed or make bar b que out of them . reread my argument , please . i do not see incest as good or anything . what i do see is that the only real rational argument against it is the genetic trouble with offspring ( all other arguments are actually problems that cause incest , not consequences of incest ) . and here , i see hipocrisy . we are prohibiting incest , but are not instituting a global consistent policy that would apply to any and all parents where genetic risks exist . adult heterosexual consenting non - related parents whose procreation is almost guaranteed to cause genetic defects ? we leave it to them to decide and choose the preventive measures . related ? prohibit regardless of chance . and really , i would actually fully support such a ( yes , very invasive ) globally consistent policy . the double standard annoys me , not that i advocate incest ( something people here fail to acknowledge ) .	0
you prove my point exactly . just because 99% of scientists believe in evolution , why should i ? because it ' s a blatantly obvious fact of nature and intellectually honest experts in the field accept it .	0
true , but as lurch corrected me before : it is the theory of evolution . and i am going to correct you again . the theory of evolution is by no means an extreme view . it is the prevailing view . more than 99% of biologists accept the theory of evolution as the best explanation for the observations .	0
i do not discount that it happens , and do acknowledge that there are people out there that do that sort of thing . but i really do believe that it ' s the definite exception rather than the rule , and personal ideology should not be made part of something like a job interview . i think it would be an exception as well . but if you see an indicator that might point to an " exception " , i think the question should be asked . consider the flip side of things . the question does not get asked . if skip had been the type of man to let a gay couple ' s house burn to spite gays , do not you think that the gay couple would have had grounds to sue the city in such a situation ? part of this is just the city covering its own <allcaps> x <elongated> </allcaps> . if they ask the question , and the guy lies , they have helped to cover their own <allcaps> x <elongated> </allcaps> by asking the question .	0
if that ' s the best you can do , simply do not address me any further . one thing is for certain that this is the last i respond to you . good day . if truth makes you uncomfortable , feel free not to respond to me . i will continue to point out hypocrisy , and bigotry . i will mock anybody who says ' slavery wasn ' t all that bad ' either .	1
and what does that have to do with the price of rice in china ? are you suggesting that in the event of a natural disaster you have the right to choose ? if a tornado tore you from your bed and cast you into oblivion , that was your choice ? maybe so . emoticonxrolleyes no doubt many lives were lost in no due to lack of means as well as ignorance but how that relates to convenience abortion on demand and the social acceptance of them escapes me . emoticonxwow obviously , in the event of a disaster , george w . bush sure thinks he has a right to choose . hmm <elongated> , let us see , should i interrupt my vacation just because people are drowning in new orleans ? naw , i do not think i should . they are just poor people and they probably did not vote for me .	1

<hashtag> 3 </hashtag> - can anyone explain to me why no other apes , monkeys or chimps have evolved into a higher species ? what is a ' higher ' species . if you mean a more intelligent primate ? <repeated> the concept there is a hierarchy of ' higher ' and ' lower ' species is incorrect . theonly difference between man and the other primates is that man has a hyperdeveloped brain . there are two sugars that are naturally produced by body by most mammals . when investingating the presnece of these chemicals , one of them is present in much lower concentrations in the brainsof all mammals . however , humans have a mutation that interrupted the production of this chemical . a piece of random junk got inserted into the middle of the gene that produces this chemical , and disabled it . sometimes , evolution is not so much about what is added , but what is removed .	0
do you support the teaching of creationism alongside evolution in public schools ? yes because it is the flipside to science and everyone deserves the right to choose in what they believe . how about other religious theories . what about teaching about the sun god ? i do not mean that they believed that , but teach it as a choice because everyone deserves the right to choose in what they believe . actually let us also teach how the theory of gravity could be wrong and people can choose to believe that invisible fairys pull people down towards the earth and other massive objects . we should teach the theory of gravity also but we need to give them the choice on what to believe .	1

this question is premised on an untenable assumption : that people should not be allowed to vote on particular issues . this premise is clearly not true in any democratic society , and is especially not true in the united states . in the united states , it is a contradiction in terms to say someone is not allowed to vote on x . i have demonstrated this before , and yet the same silly question keeps coming up . that ' s not exactly true now , is it ? people get to vote for elected officials , and that ' s all that ' s guaranteed federally . some states have provisions for allowing people to vote on local laws , but in some states the government is allowed to prevent the vote . and of course there is no provision at all allowing the people to vote on federal laws . so in point of fact it is a true statement that in the united states someone is not allowed to vote on x , for some values of x .	0

i would love to see more discussion of views that are in between the two extremes of abortion illegal at all times , and abortion allowed at all times . my own view is between the two , closer to the pro - choice side . yes , it is interesting how we draw an arbitary " legal line in the sand " with regards to determining how late into a pregnancy an elective abortion is available .	0
there is considerable confusion about the legal theory underlying the " right to keep and bear arms " . this is a brief outline for a clarification of the discussion of this issue . > ( 1 ) the second amendment to the u.s. constitution does not establish the right to keep and bear arms . none of the provisions of the constitution establish any " natural " rights . they recognize such rights , but the repeal of such provisions would not end such rights . such rights were considered by many of the framers as obvious or " self - evident " , but they were immersed in the prevailing republican thought of the day , as expressed in the writings of locke , montesquieu , rousseau , madison , hamilton , and others , which discussed " natural rights " in some detail . others argued that at least some of the rights needed to be made explicit in the bill of rights to avoid having future generations with less understanding of republican theory weaken in their defense of those rights . that has turned out to have been a good idea > ( 2 ) the right to keep and bear arms is a natural right of individuals under the theory of democratic government . this was clearly the understanding and intent of the framers of the u.s. constitution and was a long - established principle of english common law at the time the constitution was adopted , which is considered to be a part of constitutional law for purposes of interpreting the written constitution . so please tell me who would be the actual criminals if the government violated the supreme law of the land and made all guns illegal ? but i do thank you for proving that there are people out there who want them all , despite the bill of rights says and what the supreme court proved was the correct meaning !	0
if it ' s a well reasoned one , yes . if it ' s yet another attempt to denigrate those who disagree with you by making absurd generalisations , then no . the attention seeking makes little sense as i rarely discuss my personal religious experiences because they are just that , personal , and because my telling people something will not be convincing to them , and hence serves no purpose . if you want to trivialise mental illness in order to belittle others then that ' s entirely your lookout . if you want i could reciprocate by pointing out how obsessive - compulsive your rants are . rants ? obsessive - compulsive ? how so ? i do not insult you with every post as you do me ? what ' s you major problem ? perhaps you need to go pray .	1

that ' s where standard rules of interpretation come in . yes there is poetry and symbolism , but there are also places for literal interpretation . without the regenerate heart by means of the born - again experience , one cannot properly discern the bible . who decides which portions are appropriate for literal interpetation ? how od you know they are right ? has it ever occured to you that the whole invisible man in the sky thing is probably not a good canidate for literal interpetation ? perhaps , as the roman elite at the time claimed , the bible was compiled , and christianity was heavily pushed , primarily as a method of controlling the people . we know the bible was heavily edited . we know that much of it was written decades after the events occured , and not by the folks claimed . is not literally interpeting anything that fraudulent a pretty poor idea ?	1

strawman . key phrase " until you can prove them " when its really " until science can prove them " . i see you still do not understand what a strawman is . it is hard to have a strawman when the comment wasn ' t directed at any particular claim . <repeated>	1
not if it were enforced and a suggestions for how the law could be better enforced are given in the report . no it did not , there ' s no suggestions for how to enforce background checks to stomp out straw purchases . stop offering non - solutions .	0
i do not think lindsay lohan is a good example of any group of people . <repeated> when i was younger i worked in retail and thieves were everywhere . <repeated> they just stole because they wanted stuff they could not afford . depends on what they were stealing while you worked in retail . and even if they did steal them , did they steal them to have them or to sell them for cash they could use on things they needed ? you would not know unless you followed their tracks after they stole . not to be a complete ass , but what you are saying sounds a lot like the corporate propaganda i have been hearing for years that encourages our culture to take a giant shit on the poor and law - breakers . when i was in high school lots of the kids stole stuff all the time . <repeated> stuff their parents did not want to buy them , peer pressure etc . i am not trying to be an ass either i am just surprised at your views on this . <repeated> maybe i will make a debate and we can see what people on here think .	0
this is personal pet - hate . <repeated> it is not true to say humans did not evolve from apes - humans are apes and we did evolve from other apes . what we did not do is evolve from any apes still living today , but our common ancestors with those apes were themselves apes . it ' s thanks to the opposers of the theory that all this rubbish about descending from monkeys and slimeball came about , all ppl need is a bit more education and things should become clearer .	0
is that why there are tens of thousands of " christian " religions ? you got it . people make mistakes . finally you see that scientists are just as human as religious people .	0
it ' s technically not killing . killing means making it dead . for the most animals , the indicator for life is brain activity ( note : brain activity is one of the requirements of life , but it ' s not <allcaps> the </allcaps> definition ) . when the sperm meets the egg , there is no brain activity . in fact there maybe no brain activity until the end of the first trimester . actually , at 24 weeks is when the the interconnection of the fetal brain begins . the nerve cells from the neocortex begin to synapse with the nerve cells of the thalamus . it is at this point that bursts of recognizable brain waves start to appear among the random signals that go on before . it is at this point that some scientists believe a fetus can feel pain as well . it is also at this point that a fetus can possibly survive outside of the womb ( 23 - 24 weeks ) , though the cance of survival is low and the risk of impairment very serious . this point probably will not change with technology either because the fetal lung is not mature enough until this point for even mechanical - assisted breathing .	0
she is ugly . i can not believe that anyone would think that she ' s good looking . she is also stupid , selfish , & anti - american wow , ' stupid , selfish , anti - american ' i am guessing you have something to back up such bold statements ? or are you just talking out of your ass again ?	0

and you , phunting , need a thump on the head from my brolly ! hun dont let no ones opinions bother you . no one matters but you , because your living your life and its your body . i personally think everyone shold hold off till 16 but im not going to insult you because thats just plain retarded . what gives you people the right to insult someone for asking a question ? im not talking about freedom of speech im talking about being a nice person . nobody has manners anymore , i swear .	0

je sens le sens du dj - vu . <repeated> i guess anyone who questions christianity is anti - christian . emoticonxrolleyes i also responded on that thread that there tons of cinderella - type stories from all over the world - does this mean that cinderella really , truly existed , and got to marry the handsome prince ? see full post here perhaps he does not mean the d - n - a , but the a - t - c - g . although somebody oughta tell him that there are not actually little tiny as and ts and cs and gs inside us . <repeated> i think he ' s referring to the 20% of dna that scientists do not yet understand the function of . <repeated> you mean ' junk dna ' ? i think it ' s more than 20% , more like 95% <url> <url> <url> i do not think that ' s what the poster was referring to , i really think he / she was ignorant of what scientists really know . basically , the fact that its there points me in the direction of evolution . also the fact that there are conserved regions of dna within codons and exons points me toward evolution as the explanation . oh , now i see ! of course they know what their own acronym stands for . they also know why they named the bases a ( adenine ) g ( guanine ) t ( thymine ) c ( cytosine ) u ( uracil ) . they named them when they were discovered . i think the poster was saying they do not know how they work , which is quite false . of course , the mechanism of protein transcription has been known for quite some time .	0
they sneer down at anyone like me who does not agree with them . instead of debating the facts , evolutionists will often resort to attacking the intelligence ( or lack of it ) in their opponent . actually , i do not sneer at you . i laugh at you . and i do not attack your intelligence but your knowledge . you are intentionally ignorant .	1
why did hitler pursue the master race of white protestant . <repeated> he did not pursue the " master race of white protestant .

the mumbai massacre was an attack by pakistani terrorists . if a country can not keep terrorists armed with machine guns and bombs from crossing its borders then you can not expect gun control to help in such situations . there might be even more such attacks in the us if the us shared a border with pakistan . we share a border with mexico . the drug cartel is armed with missile and grenade launchers . but when was the last time 72 of our police officers were murdered on american soil , in a single day , at a single location ? the countries with the greatest number of legal gun ownership , they are absent these mass killings that take place on a regular basis . there ' s no rebels in america killing entire cities worth of people without opposition ; not even in the small towns that ' re without a local police force . explain that one away .	0

and you are an excellent example of those who believe want thecracy . who profess to love freedom but are in fact liberty - challenged . the fact that you have said nothing in response to this charge after multiple posts is quite revealing . show me the post where i want a theocracy or eat it . back at you . god creates life in a mothers womb ( psalm 139 : 13 , etc . ) . you can not stand the truths in the bible , can you ? you have to hem and haw and do a barack obama and try to spin it away . it ' s not working for you , pappi . jesus is the resurrected savior and god creates life . and you can not stand the truth .	1
why , why do not you tell us . speculating is not enough . back it up with independant evidence . also , show that the " new testament believers " suffered persecution and even death from any source that does not come through the christian authorities . you can start your own thread on how historical the gospel accounts , etc . , are . how about dealing with the question now instead of running scared and going down another rabbit trail ?	1
you are an idiot who has obviously never worked ina first responder category . if you think that increasing the volume and social acceptance of drug use to the same level of alcohol will ' solve ' anything , then you are just an idiot . you have obviously never seen whart drug abuse does to families and people ' s lives . you are right , alcohol is worse , and the main reason its worse is because of 2 reasons , volume and availability ala social acceptance . legalizing all drugs would have catastrophic social impacts . do not feed me that line about taxing it and using the money for rehab . we have taxed the <allcaps> x <elongated> </allcaps> out of tobacco and alcohol the last 100 years and the last time i checked alcoholism and lung cancer had not been erradicated . first of all , the government cannot increase the volume and social acceptance of a drug - only the market and society can do that . government cannot even decrease the volume or social acceptance of drugs - despite the government ' s efforts , drug use has remained relatively constant . what has not remained constant is violent crime , which has gone up during the drug war as it did during alcohol prohibition .	0
the democrats are going to do anything they can to bring down the gop . <repeated> this is just another ' thing ' to bring up to show how ' stupid ' america is for putting them in power . just like this delay thing . <repeated> yeah he might be wrong . <repeated> but would we know about it if the partisan tables were switched the other way . <repeated> just crappy politics as usual . agreed , and they are really grasping at straws now . i am surprised that anyone still takes kennedy seriously . emoticonxrolleyes	1
you implied with you catty comeback that i was mistaken in stating that hitler started out as an insignificant foot soldier . did not intend to , he was in fact an enlisted soldier in ww1 . my implication was so what ? he was far better known as a failed artist .	0
this is silly . you say you are using the article as justification for the question and then you want to call us dishonest when you do not even cite the article or the newspaper it comes from ? there are two words that come to mind describing this situtation : mendacious is one . <repeated> hacktacular is another . <repeated> probably because the article is irrelevant . either way , i posted an article to make you happy so quit compaining and just answer the question with some respect . thanks for just simply answering dog . <repeated> i am not sure why it is so complicated . if you do not ask race than how can you be prejudice ? there is also no proof that people would currently be discriminated against . but current affirmative action is a topic for another thread .	0
even before the repeal of d.c. ' s handgun ban , the city ' s police reestablished a gun - recovery unit and focused on seizing illegal firearms . so then the handgun ban did absolutely nothing . nice to see you could finally admit the truth .	1
i see you still think my goal in life is to go back and read every post you ever made . lol as stated in answers in genesis , creationaries have to admit to speciation . otherwise the ark wont hold all the animals . somethings got to give , which do you want to give up , no speciation or the ark . lol but it makes you look a fool that you make comments without knowing . does not it . so you think that just because you enter a debate half - way , you can still give an uninformed opinion ? were not you the one ready to laugh at me ? i will not laugh at you . i am only saddened by your personal attacks . yes , repeating yourself . i know what they say , you know what they say . i do not agree with them , on these points . answers in genesis are ' right ' by your account on this occasion - see my previous post about us both being ' selective ' in the information we use ; again a lack of insight into your own thought processes . i disagree with them . do you agree with their claim that speciation in fact disproves evolution ? i bet you have been very selective here too !	1
you agreed with trebor pappy . <repeated> now you are back pedalling . <repeated> re previous post yes secular governments work . nor does it take much to see the philosophical similarities , as pointed out by trebor , between a religion , such as christianity or islam and communism , socialism , capitalism , totalitarism or a monarchy , but it does require an additional step , hence my comment of 2 + 2 + 2 . but just for kicks , let us say i am fully on board with communism as a religion and am now jumping ship on the idea . this would be the only reason you can give , other than what you have misunderstood which is explained abvove , that makes the study flawed . which does not take a genius to grasp makes no sense whatsover . so take your time , think about it , because there is an argument to made for your view and i am surprised nobody picked up on it , but let us see if you can figure it out on your own .	1

i am an atheist and i support you 100% . fuck all the fags . their lifestyle is a choice and the concept of gay marriage is a mockery of the institution . yeah but i do not hate gays because they are still people i just hate the sin and the lifestyle that they are in . wow i have never seen an atheist who is against gay marriage . i am impressed .	0
that is one definition of creation . there are many . you again make a mistake of making an assumption about what you want to argue about , and argue against that . if you want a ( non - exhaustive list ) see <url> have simply picked one model , treated it as the only one , and constructed a ( thus false ) argument against it . oh it ' s no mistake montalban . i , unlike you , am quite clear in my arguments , and have a direction and a goal . we can take your other definitions of creationism one at a time , thank you very much . i ' d like to first focus on the one that involves your god , or any god , described as being unknowable ( which you have said your god is ) . will you " allow " us to focus on <allcaps> one </allcaps> thing ? you see , if we have a list of 4 things , and we go through them one by one , we can maybe arrive at the end ! <repeated> crazy thought is not it !	0
we had light and dark moths before the industrial revolution , actually , we did not . the first record of a melanic form was in 1848 . presumably other melanic individuals had appeared before this , both in biston bebularia as well as other moths . we know that a similar mutation occucrred in other moths north america some years after the 1848 record of the b . betualria . there are actually several alleles of the gene responsible for color that form a dominence hierarchy with the fully black morph ( called carbonaria ) as the top dominant and the typical as recessive . the intermediate forms are referred to as insularia . they are uncommon . at any rate , by 1895 , 98% of observed b . betularia in industrialized areas were carbonaria .	0
and i say you are both spiritually - challenged and do not know what you are talking about . jesus is lord and all who deny him are antichrists ( 1 john 2:22 ) . and anybody who ' s a trebor - trekkie can not be all there anyway . ah yes , the ' let us pull a smug and self serving quote out of context from the bible and use it as in insult , therefore god exist ' routine . that arrogant method of using self congratulatory bible quotes to insult and denigrate your opponent is neither an effective debate technique , or does it help convince those people on the boarder line to convert to christianity . it does drive them away , so please , be my guest and keep on trying to use it . i figure the ratio of people you drove away from christianity to those people who were converted to christianity from you must be way lop sided .	1
the nra also filed suit this week . yeah , right ! <repeated> wonder when d . c . is going to run out of money trying to defend the indefensible ? <repeated> i am surprised homeland security can not have gun ' s in dc banned . it ' s a federal designation , is it not ?	0
how many civil rights are you willing to give up in the name of a few less murders each year ? in 2000 , the u.s. recorded close to 11,000 firearm homicides and more than 16,000 firearm suicides . the european union - - an area with a population approximately 25% higher than that of the u.s. - - reported fewer than 1,300 firearm homicides for the same year . in japan , the number was 22 . sinjin - the us firearm homicide rate is more than 1 8 0 x that of japan .	0
how does gay legalised gay marriage = legalized polygamy ? how does equal protection come into play on that equation ? because if you let gays marry because it is an alternitve way the equal protection says that if you let one happen you have to let the others have that right to . but that is not really my point my real point is that if we let this happend it will ruin marriage in this country , marriage is a bond between a man and a women and if we let gays marry this country will be ruining that tradition thus making this country more secular then it all ready is . <allcaps> and we have to stop that </allcaps> .	0

catholics have a different belief . the goal is to always save both mother and child . if the fetus dies during the attempt to save both , then that ' s what happens . for instance , with an ectopic pregnancy , the goal is not to kill he fetus , the goal is to save both mother and fetus . you told me in an earlier post that the mother should die , even if they predict the fetus will kill the mother . your bible states otherwise .	1
you have got one little fly in the ointment there , jax . it ' s called originalist judges ( thank god roberts will be confirmed ) . you freely admit that you want activist judges to push your liberal agenda . a judge is not a legislator . judge roberts had the right analogy of a baseball umpire . to interpret the literal meaning of the law . emoticonxidea i think you may be very very suprised by roberts . i like some of the answers he is giving . i have a feeling you conservates may get f***cked <censored> . he is not as conservate as you think . besides even if he is conservate he certainly is not as conservate as the emoticonxcensored he is replacing . as a citizen of virginia do you support this law that strips people of their wills and powers of attorny ? <url> this is just a very mean law and will hurt many people .	0

locked door sounds good to me . are we assuming that the hijacker also has a gun ? or would otherwise it result in a duel with plastic forks and the purple thing left over from lunch ? trouble is this question leads to the next one - would you prefer to possibly have a passanger with a gun , a the hijacker almost certainly with one . or neither having a gun ? i think it would be best for neither one to have a gun , as there would be no chance of me getting hurt . after all , i could beat up a guy armed with a plastic fork . however , if the hijacker has a gun , i ' d like someone ( not me , i am half blind in each eye , i ' d probably hit a passanger or something ) to have a gun .	1
why do liberals always resort to personal attacks ? why are they so angry ? oh wait i know why . <repeated> republicans control the presidency , both houses of congress , and most governorships . <repeated> i guess i would be angry to if my party was so far down the food chain . <repeated> <happy> huh . explain why you call people bush haters and use personal attacks yourself when you are running out of ammo ? oh yes , it ' s because you are a hypocrite . i am voice of treason , i can call people all the horrible names i want , but the minute they say one bad thing about me , i whine like a little girl about how it ;'s so unfair and how they are meanies !	1

yeah , i know , the vast majority of the founding fathers and over 80% of all americans are deluded , and you secularists are the only ones who know the real truth . no , we do not claim to know the truth . we gladly say " we do not know " to questions like " why are we here " instead of making up fairy tale answers just because we are too impatient to look for the truth . tell us , do you still believe in the fire god and the tooth fairy too ?	1

i think part of the problem is that you do not need to " explain " that to me at all . <allcaps> that </allcaps> is my point . you consistently criticize the gay side for not acknowledging that it ' s their " belief " , but you are repeatedly " not addressing " their side regarding the <allcaps> accuracy </allcaps> of their belief . but for some reason , when it comes to gay . <repeated> whatever . emoticonxrolleyes i think you are making a mountain out of a molehill here , but that ' s up to you .	1

that just shows how nutty it is . using your argument , someone could reject all scientific theories because most of them are wrong : apparently even yec are in this sense more rational than dawkins . the claim that faith is accepted mainly because people are told to is very dodgy . religion seems to naturally arise , although there are many theories as to how and why , religious and otherwise . think of religion like morality : the idea varies , but seems to exist everywhere and often seems to appeal to the same things . it is often ' taught ' but this does not mean it does not occur naturally : indeed , a system of explaining away what would otherwise be ethical / religious is needed , and this requires a more direct and deliberate move : thus the cack - handed attempts at replacing religion with deliberate human constructs . daniel dennett asks , how did just one species , homo sapiens , acquire the numinous perspective that can have such a profound influence on people ' s lives ? he seems to think that religions evolved and originally served a ' primitive ' philosophical intention - such as explaining the hidden ' causes ' of natural events in pre - scientific societies . to give just one example : the rise and fall of the tides were observed , but not understood . so the phenomena were attributed to the power of a god ( or gods ) etc . i think this is a pretty commonplace answer , but not necessarily wrong . why has religion survived the scepticism of the intellectual enlightenment and the rational attacks of science ? the idea that some fundamental ' psychic need ' in humanity is satisfied by having religious beliefs seems ( to me ) the most promising speculation .	0

what ? <repeated> you mean they do not think that most people are out to exterminate gays ? that most people actually do have reasons for their beliefs , and that the world does not always line up with the all - or - nothing ' equality - obsessed ' modern gay pride movement ? who ' da thunk it ? emoticonxgood the idea that most people hate gays is , of course , a propagandist view by the gay pride movement . i would hope judges would not fall into that way of thinking , and the fact these judges did not shows they are good judges . no one believes this . this is a non - issue . i am not surprised you would respond that way jyoshu . you do not take these issues seriously at all . thus you can have a good laugh , and be sarcastic and think you are witty . in reality , it shows how clueless you are in terms of gay issues . ' the equality - obsessed modern gay pride movement ' ? gays do not have equality , and therefore there is a movement for that . i do not think anyone is obsessed with equality . i could just as quickly say there is an obsession with keeping gays in an unequal status .	0
<allcaps> mirrored post </allcaps> , . <repeated> it might be easiest to preserve flow later on if we do not actually mirror each of our posts once comments arrive ( and inevitably digress ) - just let people quote / cite us from this one if needs be . i certainly plan on adding in more off - topic commentary / digressions in the mirror thread ( marked in these posts as * , when i remember to ) . iangb , i would have thought that you would be intellectually honest enough to have ( at least ) accepted the fact that i have supported my claims . i also thought that ( by now ) someone from your side of the abortion issue would step in ( in this thread or by private message ) and hold you to your claims of being ' intellectually honest .

here you reveal exactly what i have just spoken of - - you assume that science and the scientific method equates to , is synonymous with , materialism / mechanism . it most certainly is not . nor is the accompanying assumption , i . e . , that any science which does not strictly adhere to materialust / mechanist assumptions , is not , and cannot be , real science . equally untrue . and here you reveal your prediliction for reading what you want to see into the words of others . i described materialism embracing new forces and phenomena which have withstood the rigors of the scientific method . i explicitly described science as a methodology , not a philosophy . you are wrong about me , ww , and the longer you pretend otherwise , the more time you are going to waste on strawmen and the more chances i am going to get to make your arguments look silly . it ' s up to you . argue with me , or argue with the person you want me to be .	0

recent studies apparently show that pot is more harmful than you say . one joint is said to contain more carcinogens than four tobacco cigarettes . i doubt your 20,000 joints theory . you have a simplistic argument going for pot . i can not agree that legalizing all drugs would be a good thing either . programs in holland have failed to produce significant if any benefits to society in general . the druggies seem to have benefitted by having arrest - free drug zones and access to whatever they want , but the cost of drugs still requires some income , something that most of them likely do not have other than from crime , begging or social programs . one " benefit " i see from legalizing drugs is that the users could be more easily identified . yea the legalizatioin of drugs would cause an epedimic of problems . crime , suicide , mental health problems , and physical health problems .	0

even if the number of defensive uses is only 800,000 a year , that ' s still a rate of more than 53 to 1 when compared to the number of homicides committed with a firearm . kleck was a supporter of the anti - gun position . but then he decided to go and commit the ultimate sin that a liberal could : he began to think in a logical and questioning manner . if he could learn the error of his ways , why can not you ? even if the number of defensive uses is only 100,000 that ' s still more than 6 to 1 when compared to the number of people murdered every year . bad comparisons . a fair comparison would be comparing the total number of defensive gun uses to the total number of gun crimes ( not just limiting it to gun homicides ) .	0

prominent conservative j . harvie wilkinson of the 4 th u . s . circuit court of appeals compared heller to roe v . wade and criticized it for its lack of adherence to conservative methodology : ' heller represents a triumph for conservative lawyers . but it also represents a failure - the court ' s failure to adhere to a conservative judicial methodology in reaching its decision . in fact , heller encourages americans to do what conservative jurists warned for years they should not do : bypass the ballot and seek to press their political agenda in the courts . ' ssrn - of guns , abortions , and the unraveling rule of law by j . wilkinson supreme court justice stevens also made a similar criticism .

' the blt : the blog of legal times : supreme court : scalia and stevens duke it out so are pro - gun activists not so different than gay rights activists ? both groups have used the courts to further their own agenda . it probably would have been better if scalia had said to himself when the case was brought before the court , ' there certainly is no consensus about the meaning of the second amendment and i , as an amateur historian , am certainly not going to force my own personal views on others . i will let the people decide through their elected representatives how much gun control is necessary in their own communities .

so what is the bible then ? simply a nice story - book for you to read from ? if genesis is simply a representative story from which we can interpret the actions of god to mean natural selection and evolution , what about the ten commandments ? it always amazes me to hear people with positions like this insist that it is okay to play fast and loose with their interpretations of genesis or the arc , but god really does hate the homosexuals . it says so in leveticus , right ? so it must be word perfect truth . <repeated> this bit about the origins of the earth ? oh , we just interpret that as god designing evolution . but that part about people burning in hell for eternity , that ' s true , right ? what about them ? is this a question ? um . have you read leveticus ? and i mean , read it . not skimmed it . because , god loves everybody . are you reaching ? and what does fast and loose mean ? i am confused . i think you are trying to label me . <repeated> but i am not quite sure what i am being labled as . what part about people burning in hell for eternity ?	1
yeah but i do not hate gays because they are still people i just hate the sin and the lifestyle that they are in . wow i have never seen an atheist who is against gay marriage . i am impressed . i am impressed you are impressed by that backward - minded bigot who ' s main insight was a mere claim without justification on any form of harm to the institution of marriage and said , ' fuck the fags ' ? come on dude .	1

but one idea that makes me hesistate to be pro - choice is an analogy . imagine a hunter who sees something moving behind a bush . it could be a deer , it could be a human , or it could be something else . the hunter lacks the information to know for sure what is behind the bush . what is the ethical policy for a hunter in this situation ? it seems clear to me : if you are not sure it ' s not human , do not kill it . so if it ' s not human , we can kill it ? but i dare say that ' s a different topic completely . sorry , that was more along animal rights than abortion . abortion is this for me : if the baby is going to endanger the mother ' s life as well as the baby , why endanger the baby and the mother ? sticking on the decided path , would you rather kill something you know is human , or something that you are not sure is human . it sounds a bit cruel and i did not intend it to be that way at all . it ' s just that one loss would hard enough , why make it two ?	1
this is the question her campaign and the whole democratic party need to answer . clinton has almost no chance of winning the nomination without causing a rift in the party , and she has an even smaller chance of winning in the general . recent polls say that almost half of all americans have a negative opinion of her , and the reverend wright scandal seems to have hurt obama less than clinton ' s campaign has hurt her in the past weeks . the longer hillary clinton stays in the race , the less likely it is that the democrats will win in november . as an outside observer , these are my thoughts too . it ' s plain selfish and stubborn as far as i am concerned , i am surprised that the democratic party itself is not stepping in , maybe they are behind the scenes . waxy	0

i support legalization of every drug . i am sure most of you are young and have been fed <allcaps> x <elongated> </allcaps> like " marijuana will kill you . " actually it does less damage to the brain then alcohol and it cannot kill you . it is impossible . it takes 20,000 joints in one sitting to overdose on marijuana . alcohol however kills thousands of americans each year from alcohol poisoning . you know that idiot pothead . he did not get dumb from pot , he got dumb from birth . marijuana does not have long term effects on iq . the only side effect is the lazy side effect . the day after a person tends to be more lazy however it is like a hang over . <repeated> it only lasts for a day . there is no reason why it should remain illegal . i also support all drugs being legalized because the drug war has failed . we spend billions each year on the drug war and i can call someone right now and pick up some crack . it is a failure . what we should do is make it government controlled and then spend the money to fight drugs on drug education . flood the schools with <allcaps> actual </allcaps> info about how herion kills and how it breaks a person down . tell the kids how you can die from one use of coke . tell them the short term and long term effects of each drug . if we can educate our kids and even adults through an ad campaign about what drugs do to you then we could save far more people . also allowing drugs to be regulated will lower the prices and effectively kill drug dealers and gangs off the streets . there are so many benefits to legalizing drugs . anyone want to fight it ? i have proof to back up what i say and also have the effects of each drug . you are an idiot who has obviously never worked ina first responder category . if you think that increasing the volume and social acceptance of drug use to the same level of alcohol will ' solve ' anything , then you are just an idiot . you have obviously never seen whart drug abuse does to families and people ' s lives . you are right , alcohol is worse , and the main reason its worse is because of 2 reasons , volume and availability ala social acceptance . legalizing all drugs would have catastrophic social impacts . do not feed me that line about taxing it and using the money for rehab . we have taxed the <allcaps> x <elongated> </allcaps> out of tobacco and alcohol the last 100 years and the last time i checked alcoholism and lung cancer had not been erradicated .	0

let me try to translate into words1 . if there is a god in this world , there is a god in all worlds2 . there being a god is a possibility3 . if there ' s a god in all worlds , there ' s a god in this one4 . there not being a god in all worlds implies that there ' s is not a god in any world ( all or nothing ) 5 . there is either a god in all worlds or there is not a god in all worlds6 . from 4,5 there either is a god in all worlds or no god in any world7 . if there ' s no god in this world then there ' s not a god in all worlds8 . there ' s either a god in all worlds or there is no god in any world . 9 . since god is a possibility we know the statement < there is no god in any world > is false . 10 . since there ' s a god in all worlds there ' s a god in this one from 3 is this the right interpretation ? if it is there is one flaw in it . <hashtag> 9 </hashtag> is flawed . just because there ' s a possibility of a god does not mean that there is a god in some world , just that there ' s a possibility of him being in some world . i am impressed ! this is a very precise description , in regular englishand yes , the deduction in 9 seems presumptious if all we state is god has a " possibility of existence " . how this was cleverly cleared up ( from the same source site ) was simply a trip back to the definition : " greatest possible being " . the " greatest possible being " , by definition , <allcaps> must </allcaps> have a possible existence . in otherwords , we cannot assume that there is a possibility that the greatest possible being does not exist . yeah , it sounds like the whole " proof " is pointless because your premise is already the proofjust keep in mind that for the purposes of this proof , god is defined as " the greatest being possible " . as long as that definition is maintained , the proof works . <repeated> does that mean that god exists ? hmm <elongated> . <repeated> emoticonxfrazzled	0

only those parts of the world that are ignorant and do not bother to do their research . those who do research recognize that even with the changes , there was still no id being taught in our classrooms , and we still had stricter definitions of " science " and stricter curriculum than 38 other states . last time i checked most state boards merely set the guidelines , whether or not they are followed is something entirely different . still the fact that you have a board of education spouting such ridiculousness is pretty damn amusing .	1
sina mostly followed instructions and smiled alluringly at men because she would have been beaten if men did not choose her . but sometimes she was in such pain that she resisted , and then she said she would be dragged down to a torture chamber in the basement . “ many of the brothels have these torture chambers , ” she said . “ they are underground because then the girls ' screams are muffled . ” as in many brothels , the torture of choice was electric shocks . sina would be tied down , doused in water and then prodded with wires running from the 220 - volt wall outlet . the jolt causes intense pain , sometimes evacuation of the bladder and bowel — and even unconsciousness . oh , but sina does not live in a womb so she is unimportant .	1
the risk of homicide in the home is three times greater in households with guns . [ 3 ] the risk of suicide is five times greater in households with guns .

i have been reading some of the replies on this page , and yes there is a very new valid way that creationists can explain the fact that we see stars that are billions of light years away in a universe that is thousands of years old . this problem is appearently solved by dr russell humphreys new " relativistic cosmology " in which he out lines in the book " starlight and time .

this i highly doubt . i think you have the 2 nd amendment on your side . i do not think acknowledging how a firearm facilitates killing weakens your case . of course neither does your nearly constant condescension and generally insulting style . it ' s just annoying . i am not surprised . i have more than that , i also have common sense on my side . firearms do not facilitate killing , firearms facilitate keeping criminals from getting a corner market on domination . the police are outnumbered by the criminals , the criminals are outnumbered by the law - abiding citizens . we should not be unarmed when we are the majority force in maintaining the balance . too bad .	0
according to this , there are 1,531 , 764 crimes stopped by guns this year ( and it ' s not even the end of the year yet ! ) . it also gives a reasonable explanation of why you do not see this on the news every day . it also says that legal gun owners account for almost 0% of all gun crime . so if you want to ban guns , 1,531 , 764 people will get killed or injured , and you will only take guns out of the hands of those who do not even commit gun crimes . but if you actually take time to read the study that is posted on that website it appears that the claims of the <allcaps> nspof </allcaps> are doubtful , inconsistent with other studies , and likely biased in favor of people answering that they had used a gun to defend themselves .	0

it is much more important that you concern yourself with the destiny of your soul , not how many years you can stay on the earth . what makes you think i do not . yours is not the only religion on earth ! <repeated> and i did not just jump to the concluision that your soul needed concern , so do not jump to it with me .	1
but by that definition , either one could be viewed as impeding on religious freedom , including your view impeding on hers ! we do not define imposing on religious freedom on the basis of having different ideals . it does not effect your religion or religious freedom if you do not get benefits under gay marriages . you can argue in other ways , on other basis , but the idea that not giving gays marriage benefits is imposing on religious freedom is an empty ' argument ' . but you have not shown how she would be harmed by equal marriage ? i have shown that her definition infringes upon my religious freedom . if gay marriage becomes a reality then in no way does it infringe upon her in any way . would you care to explain how gay marriage infringes upon her in any way ? it is her heterosexual privledge and her sence of entitlement that she is protecting not marriage .	0

in contrast , evolutionists laughingly look at the miniscule differences between individuals of a population and dare call those who survive the " fittest " - - when actually , since each member of the population is almost exactly the same , the " fittest " are actually just the luckiest they are not exactly the same . see the examples above . it is not random .	0

athiesim has no such standard , and i do not want to hear about relative " ethics " that mean nothing , or have no longevity , or change with the winds . atheism does not have that standard because it ' s not that encompassing a thought . all athiesm is , is a lack of theism , period . it says nothing about morals or ethics . your typical athiest , though , looks within to find what ' s moral or ethical and it usually just stems from what ' s acceptable behavior within the human species . this is also where religion gets its morality and ethics . but times change , and eating shellfish will not kill you , and eating meat on friday will not make the farmers go broke , so the morals and ethics change to fit the society .	0
i did not say it was making me hungry . i asked if i said that , would that sound gay . <repeated> again , it was a joke . <repeated> uhg . <repeated> __ _ __ __ . you seem to be lost in our jokes , you have to tell people you are joking so they know . and you got the punctuation wrong , in the russian phrase . the only way for it not to sound insane in russian , would be to put it as : ' ___ _ __ . __ ' . calling someone ' __ ' , means things are serious , and you are ready for a fight . if you claim it to be a joke , you are just insane . so i assume that you got the punctuation wrong , and it was your signature .	0

it seems to me the corollary of the phrase " abortion is murder " is " miscarriage is manslaughter " , and that any consistent pro - life advocate must urge any mother who accidentally loses her child due to actions she undertook , be charged with manslaughter . i wonder , is this actually the case ? manslaughter involves a direct action that causes an unintentional death . miscarriage is involuntary ; besides the person suffering a miscarriage might well want to keep the baby . to equate miscarriage with manslaughter is preposterous .	0
just as well , i dont like arguing with a liar , so call us even . not once did i change the meaning of anything you said , so unless you ' d like to quote where i did that , all you have is baseless assertions and a cool method of squirming out of statements you cant support take a look at your post no . 80 time - stamped 6-26-06 09:55am wherein you said . <repeated> in response to my post <hashtag> 79 </hashtag> wherein i said : does that not comply with my claim that you change what i say ? back in post <hashtag> 77 </hashtag> , i requested that you quote and debunk the links . you merely scoffed at them ( as i expected ) . prior to initiating any other question to me or introducing a tangential argument , please explain the above . i will be back next week .	0
there you go again , conflating questioning with disobeying . da*n <censored> right you should question the cop who pulls you over . " when was your speed gun last calibrated ? " is a good question .

how is my poll biased ? i have a wide range of options . when logic tells me something different from a poll , it means the accuracy of the poll may be questionable . that ' s all i am saying . i apologize if you are somehow offended . you say some of us are lying and then you say you apologize " if " we are " somehow " offended . gee , that ' s mighty white of you .	1
lacking substance as usual . <repeated> whether jefferson said it or not is not the issue . the topic of this thread is " 15 myths about gun control " but you seem unable to make a logical point so you resort to attacking the individual . <repeated> so you are accusing me of the thing that your most guilty of ? as i remember your posts have been censored several times by admin because you resorted to viscious personal attacks and name calling . and are not you interested in the truth . why is not whether jefferson said it or not important ?	0

oh good grief ! i have always lived in rough areas . in one city , alburquerque , a drug deal went sour 10 feet fom where i slept , and a guy had his head blasted away by a shotgun . where i worked , less than a block away , a gunner massacred everyone in a video rental place . i was even obliged to ferry a guy with a slash on his throat to an er , i did not know the stupid beast , i was scared to death , but i felt it my christian duty ( even though i am not a christian ) to get the guy to where he could get treatment . and i do not own a damned gun because i am not chicken - hearted . i sincerely doubt any of that happened . if so you would have links . yea we know you are cyber brave to the point of heroine status . you are a troll pure and simple .	1

he was arrested and spent several hours in a cell when plainly he had not broken any laws . plain with the benefit of hindsight . i love how you are able to determine , not having been there , precisely what was said and precisely where it fell in relation to the law . if it was so clear , we will see the prosecution for wrongful arrest in due course , i am sure .	1
a newborn baby cannot think mentally like an adult , but does that make him / her a less valuable life ? if a woman is raped , and a two year old is raped , is it not an equally bad crime considering the two year old did not understand what was happening ? i have the same view on abortion . i think you misunderstand my view . i think that a third - term fetus is already sufficiently a person , so i would <allcaps> certainly </allcaps> consider a newborn baby a person . to me , a person is one who has the most basic , rudimentary sense of thought and emotion . a late - term fetus , from my point of view , is no less a person than an einstein . an einstein , of course , is much more useful to a much greater number of people , but from the simple point of view of whether he is more of a person , i would say not .	0

is there more ? yup ! i was referring to your outright statement that there was ' no liberal party ' when indeed there is one almost in every country . you paint with a broad brush and do not have a clue what the color happens to be . i do not suppose you need to be a member to be educated enough to realize the different parties even though you claim to vote and the parties are listed on the ballot ? in other words , your imagination is your guide ? that will serve you well emoticonxrolleyes whether there ' s liberal parties in other countries is beside the point . there is no national ' liberal party ' in the usa . if nato was suggesting the ny one , i hardly can be held responsible for not knowing ' their message ' . i could not care less what it might be . she said as much . let us see what happens next , shall we ? i have a feeling she will be amending the policy shortly .	0
it ' s nice to think that you will ' plan ' a child later but , life seldom works that way . i ' d hate to think that once you are finally ready to have a child , your uterus has been scarred to infertility or have sever complications in conception , carrying the child to term or delivery . i ' d be ironic for another yuppy type who can not have children on their own due to an abortion to have to incure greater medical costs to have one or legal costs to adopt . <repeated> and maybe even seeking a foreign child as there are not any easily to be had here . <repeated> since they were all aborted . also , the older you get , the more health issues possible for the child . i will have you know that the abortion went without a hitch , and my uterus is perfectly healthy , thankyouverymuch ( not that it is any of your emoticonxcensored business ) , and yes , i do plan to have a child in the future , and do not really care what you think about it .	0

the statement was made based upon historical evidence . practices such as loyalty oaths and fire safety ordinances were common place in colonial times and could be regarded as restrictions on the bearing of arms for effective self defense . the supreme court never determined that these were unacceptable restrictions or infringements . so a gun is a fire hazard in a public place ? i gotta say the gun haters are getting more creative with their arguments .	1

but i do take offence at you characterizing my ability to reason logically and to think with some originality as being nothing more than ' manipulation ' and sophistry . the value of logical reasoning is dependent upon your axioms . highly religious people are no less capable of reasoning logically than anyone else - but the unshakeable axiom that their personal version of god really exists enters into every equation . for you , one axiom is the existence of vitality ; volition made quantifiable , and the other is that darwinian evolution must be wrong and worthless in every respect . there is no logical reason for you to deride ns the way you do ; it ' s an integral part of any evolutionary theory that seeks to explain the big picture of how the organisms we see around us came to be ; the occurrence of mutations , volitional or otherwise is not enough on its own . but your axioms prevent you from incorporating it into <allcaps> eam </allcaps> and getting on with your life .	0
i reckon that evolution is still just a theory for a valid reason . it is untrue and cannot be proven . darwin himself said that his theory would be proven or disproven based on the future discovery of transitional fossils . there have been no such fossils ever found . that being the case , even darwin agrees that the theory of evolution is just man ' s folly . you all can write millions of words about evolution , but what you lack is the proof of one discovery of transitional fossils the fact of the matter is that god created man in his own image . case closed . hunter , would you be interested in actually discussing this logically ? or do you simply wish to toss out empty assertions and run away when challenged ? if your view is the truth , then you have no reason to run .	1
is that worth it ? i do not think so . i have my own idea for a healthcare plan . <repeated> it ' s not at all universal , but it helps the people who need help without subjecting people to substandard care . i have heard that the <allcaps> usa </allcaps> spends around 40% ( total ) more on health care than canada does . that would be impressive if it were not for one fact . the <allcaps> usa </allcaps> has 900% of our population . it is your administration costs what are getting you the most . we only spend around 11% on administration while the <allcaps> usa </allcaps> spends around 25% of their health care dollars . we have a cap on how much a doctor can be sued for as well . yes , our system is not perfect , but it still works . nearly 50 million americans do not have health care at all , that is around 18% of your total population . this is quite shameful . as i have stated , the <allcaps> usa </allcaps> is the only nation in the industrialize world to not have universal health care .	0
seems your post has take the wrong turn . somebody with the opposite view may post . ' who should make the choice , the state or the feckless woman who refused to use birth control ? ' dont try the rape bs . the amount of abortions carried out due to the woman not bearing to be able to come to term with a rapist ' s baby is negligable compared to women who abort their babies due to lifestyle choice . i still think you are simones sock puppet so who should make the choice in the scenario you propose ? for me , it must always and forever be the woman . btw , why is it in your example that the man is not the one who refused to use birth control ? in any case , i do not want the nanny state involved in the most intimate choice a woman will ever have to make . btw , who is simone ?	0

oh , i know what he is trying to establish there . i do want him to own up and admit what he is trying to establish . do not expect him to , but hey , " miracles " happen ( according to him ) . : pin fact , as a return question , i ' d like to ask him : does someone rely on the odyssey to establish the existence of pallas athene , circe or calypso ? because the iliad and odyssey do not claim to be divine does not mean they should be placed under a different threshold as the bible . otherwise , it ' s special pleading on your part , and thus logically fallacious . this is one of many inconsistencies between skeptics in regards to the scrutiny of the bible . they are unwilling to put the standards they have on the bible against other books similar in age . if they did , there would not be a single book left standing .	0
i used to think the answer to this was bin laden , but after reading an article called ' the brain ' ( playboy ' s june issue ) , i switched my opinion to khalid shieikh mohammed . does anyone else agree with me ? this guy was the mastermind behind so many terrorist attacks ( incl . 9 / 11 ) that it made my head spin . it was also surprising to read that he received his bachelor ' s degree here in the states , with classmates describing him as a ' class clown ' . simply crazy , and scary when you think about it . thoughts or opinions ? steve what about god ? so many god - fearing people , he must be a terrorist <happy> seriously i really do not know much about terrorists . i know that bin laden was behind 9 / 11 but he wasn ' t the only one , but that ' s about it .	1
ok , are <allcaps> you </allcaps> willing to settle for legal recognition of your relationship with your spouse under federal and state laws as a " civil union " only ? you would still maintain the right to consider yourselves as " married " under whatever religious denomination you choose . but my relationship is between a man and woman . you would be asking marriage to be redefined to do that . remember , part of what defines marriage is that it is between a man and woman .	0

what ? is this an indictment of capitalism ? if it is , i do not share your sentiments . what is capitalism ? can there be something like ' responsible capitalism ' and , if so , what would ' responsible capitalism ' be ? my view is that the term ' capitalism ' has a multitude of meanings dependent upon who is defining it and that ' capitalism ' could have a multitude of modifiers to further refine its meaning . is to be a capitalist to be utterly free of responsibility and blame for the evils that capitalism may cause ?	0

emoticonxdonno sorry , but intelligent and dynamic lifeforms do not refute naturalistic theories of evolution . idism is a dead duck . indeed , it was neither intelligent nor dynamic . toe is a mechanistic theory - - it says life is like a machine . machines are not intelligent , they just do what they are made / programmed to do . darwinists say lifeforms do what they do because of the way their particular genes program them . this is basic stuff . <repeated> yet you come along and say this is not so . so which is it ? is life intelligent or not ? if it is intelligent , what is illogical about believing life was designed intelligently by an intelligent designer ? the intelligence had to come from somewhere . where did the information in the <allcaps> dna </allcaps> code come from ?	0
or maybe we have a mental disability ? yes , it is not common to show anger when you are happy . however , just because the majority of people share something in common does not always mean the truth ? i always wonder if the majority is wrong ? what i mean is : what if the people in the mental hospitals are mentally normal and those who are classifed as normal are not normal ? you can choose a sonnet and correctly pick ' s its emotion but you can never be so sure . that is my problem . how do you know for sure if the emotion you choose is correct ? please give an example of this sonnet ? lol we are so off topic . i do not want to spam her debate . lets continue this debate in the messaging system please . however , just because the majority of people share something in common does not always mean the truth ? very good . philosophers call this type of argument ' argumentum ad populum ' . it is a fallacy that many people are prone to commit . you can choose a sonnet and correctly pick ' s its emotion but you can never be so sure i agree . shakespearean scholars often disagree about very miniscule details . but i think just because they are not ' sure ' , that does not mean that they can not be certain . maybe you could go google ' shakespeare sonnet 1 ' and read just the first poem of his sonnets collection . tell me what you think ! i am sure that shakespeare will charm you like he has charmed so many .	0

um . have you read leveticus ? and i mean , read it . not skimmed it . because , god loves everybody . are you reaching ? semantics . god has mandated against homosexuality . my point is , people are prepared to admit that the creation story , and the story of noahs arc are metaphors . they read them , and then look at the evidence to hand and say " well , it can not be really true the way it is written , so it must mean this . <repeated> " but the bias of the church against homosexuality is based of a small passage of text which , it seems , cannot be interpreted away . that part that condemns homosexuality is accurate , straight - from - gods - mouth truth . again , why the dichotomy ? why are some parts of the bible open to interpretation , but others are rigid ?	0
it ' s not as though our vocal opponents of climatological science have exactly been enlightening . we have yet to hear why they think the scientific consensus is wrong . we ' d have define consensus first . if it is 50% + 1 then there probably is one . then after that , who is saying they are wrong ? prejudice as its finest . lesz likes to stereotype people to an extreme that can never be changed . i have never told lesz my views on global warming and lesz has shown no interest in gathering facts about what others believe .	1

you have not provided any evidence the bible is a fairy tale . but i do think you like the sound of those last two words in the previous sentence . it ' s god or the government ( romans 13 ) in the nt who dispense capital punishment . if you were not so consumed with your illicit gay sex escapades to read the nt you would have known that . keep screwing around and god himself just might take you and / or your buddy jazy off the earth like he did with annanias sapphira in the book of acts . does the military have a position on this or have any data to show it helps or hurts something ? really that is what it should come down to .	0
people who own weapons are not responsible for combating or preventing crime in general . gun ownership does not commit us to becoming default cops . what ownership does is allow us to protect ourselves in the event of an armed criminal attack . so the basis for your articles thesis is fallacious in expecting armed people to somehow become extensions of law enforcement in order to justify being armed . therefore , the only rational response to your premise is to encourage more law abiding people to be armed and trained so as to outnumber the armed criminals so they will have no unarmed citizens to victimize . that is the most effective way to intimidate the lawless criminals into never using their weapons for violence for fear that their intended victim may actually be better armed then they are . good observation ! he is very good at presenting fellatious viewpoints and lack of knowledge and content . he is one of the more fellatious people i know and you will not find him taking notice of the constitution as the supreme law of the land either .	1

" so are you arguing that two brothers do have the right to marry ? i am reading your posts , but you seem to make contradictory arguments . that may be because i just do not understand what you are writing . i thought you were arguing that there is no right of same - sex couples to marry but that they should be allowed to marry anyway . it sounded like a nuanced argument to me . but apparently that is not what you were saying ? can you clarify this ? thanks .	0
how is that conclusion derived at ? the passage is speaking to the consequences to a man who ' s actions cause the death of an unborn child . it is in the first place unclear to whom the " further harm " is done . but even granting that the fetus dies , it is not clear how the situation is analogous to abortion , because the intentions of not only the man but even more importantly of the pregnant woman are completely different .	0

one of these aspects of existence which we arbitarily believe in is cause and effect . another is the external world . a third is the consciousness of others . a fourth is the past etc . etc . they originally might have been an arbitrary guess , but experience of all humans always has given them a very high probability of being true ( at least the existence of the outside world , the others are abstract logical concepts that do not have a physical reality , just an abstract one ) .	0

indeed , for several decades , molecular evolutionists have relied on an evolutionary view that abandons the darwinian presumption of abundant pre - existing variation , assuming instead that the rate of evolution depends directly on the rate of introduction of new alleles by mutation . interesting , but it appears to ignore the fact that there is pre - existing variation ( just look at the pictures ) . emphasizing mutations is ok , but relying solely on them will probably skew results .	0
the fetus is non - sentient , so it has no ' desire ' . the fetus is totally dependent on a woman ' s body , and has no existence without the woman ' s body . this is not the case with a dog . this is not the case with the woman . she is a sentient person , and not a container . she undergoes physical changes and physical risks by being pregnant . she risks , and she sacrifices , using her own body . it is selfish of a man to think he can control her body and her life . it will never have the same kind of impact on his health and on his life , that it will have on hers . not even close . apparently you need to read up on up - to - date cases of fetus viability and premature birth success statistics . that ' s right , and she does it after the baby is born by caring for it as well . so ? i guess you ' d also be in favor of it being legal for a mother to not allow her baby to live because she has to care for it after it ' s born too , with that reasoning . there are many , many women in the pro - life movement . my wife is one of them and she is a lot more passionate about it than i am . ( trust me , you do not want to be in a room with her after you have killed a baby ! ) if you think this is a men versus women issue , you are sadly mistaken .	1

i find it funny how a person can see how wrong it is to kill a baby after cutting it from a womb , yet they do not think it ' s wrong while the baby is still in it . that ' s what baffles me about pro - choicers ( pro - abortionist ) . i wonder if there were a glass window allowing people to see what they are killing , if they would still feel no emotion . why do you think they feel no emotion ? all the women i know who have aborted did so under very difficult circumstances and it was horrible for them . most women who seek abortion are not unfeeling sluts . they are real women , with real issues , and real circumstances that lead them to that choice . want to help those babies ? address the issues the women face and do not demonize . no amount of legislation can make for succesful pregnancy without the support of the mother . dismiss her and you will fail to do anything to help anyone .	0

how about : a woman wakes up to find herself connected to a body . a body without a brain , which is using her own organs to be alive . doctors are preparing to transplant a brain from a dying violinist into this new one connected to her and the date is set in the future . would it be morally correct to disconnect herself and kill this body that has no identity , mind , consciousness or existence in actuality ? yes , in my view , it would be morally correct since it has no brain and , in my definition , is not a person with rights . however , if she does not want to support the violinist in that future , she has the responsibility to disconnect from ( and therefore kill ) that brainless body before the brain gets transplanted . otherwise , if she waits to disconnect until it is too late , she would be guilty of killing the violinist ( a person ) .	0
i am confused . what exactly is the difference between a civil union and a marriage . from what i have found , they are identical with the exception of one is religious and the other secular . is there a larger legal difference ? there is a pretty huge difference . civil unions are not nationally recognized , for one thing , since not every state has them . if you travel to a state that does not offer civil unions , then your union is not valid there . i think there ' s a problem with dissolving those unions as well . the big difference , though , are the rights that these unions provide . there are over 1,000 legal protections and rights that marriage provides that civil unions do not . i will try and find a list of differences .	0

archangel is right on this one . it ' s completely absurd to compare a tumour to a healthy fetus , which has a separate blood system , and in a relatively short space of time will be an independent person . <repeated> archie is <allcaps> not </allcaps> right - he has an opinion , as we all do . pro - lifers seem to want the definition of human with attendant rights to begin at conception . the blastocyst is now turning into a tumour . so the pro - lifers can now alter their views on what constitutes ' human ' as and when it suits their purpose . forget the emotive view of what an embryo / foetus looks like : some think that as long as it has appendages and looks human , then it is . it is not . it ' s still a parasitic organism dependant on the host mother . you can not deny that . contraception v . abortion is a separate issue : in the meantime , the host mother should be the final arbiter of what happens to her body .	0

i do not think that killing people as a form of punishment is setting a very good example to the rest of the world - if the public start to see authorities giving people death penalties , everybody will just think that killing is ok and it will be a vicious circle ! the best way to get through to people , i think , about what they have done wrong in society is by teaching / encouraging / inspiring them , not killing . if we killed more people that were guilty of their crime more people would not want to commit the crime because of the circumstances . if they do not care about the circumstances they are insane .

your reasoning would be applicable if only one copy of the gene in question ever existed . if the chance of mutation a happening is one in a billion , and the chance of mutation b happening is also one in a billion , then the chance of them both happening together to a single gene is , as you say , beyond the realms of possibility at 1 in 1,000 , 000,000 , 000,000 , 000 . however , we are not talking about a single gene . a population of a billion bacteria is nothing unusual , and all of them will contain the same gene . so while the odds of any individual experiencing mutation a are very low , the odds of one of them experiencing it are pretty high . the lottery works on the same principle . you probably will not win , but someone probably will . ok , so now we have our billion bacteria , one of which possesses mutation a . however , the odds of mutation b stacking with it are still only 1 in 1,000 , 000,000 . now , if mutation a is not particularly helpful , that ' s probably the end of the story . but if mutation a is helpful , then that bacterium will outcompete its peers for resources , and breed more readily than they do - either better in absolute terms , or better in immediate proximity , when in competition for the same resources . either way , the proportion of the population possessing mutation a will increase until they predominate . now there is not just one copy of the a - mutant gene in circulation , there are about a billion , and the odds of mutation b stacking with just one of them are greatly improved . once again , if mutation b is helpful the descendents of that bacterium will flourish and overrun the population , so that in a relatively short time ( a few hundred bacterial generations ) a single cell possessing neither mutation can give rise to a population of a billion all possessing not one but two billion - to - one mutations - a population ready for the next billion - to - one mutation to occur , and stack , and flourish , and so on . i hope that helps . well this is what i am saying . the probability of a and b in one organism i very low . and the probability of a and b in many generations is lower than just a . this is what behe deals with in his book . one reason evolution of primates interest me more than bacteria is the the number of organisms and generations is much much lower , and the changes involved must be pretty big . it involves real evolution as opposed to stuff like antibiotic resistance or sicke cell haemoglobin that i see more as a reversable adaption , not a developement to a permanently better / more complex state . <allcaps> imo </allcaps> there should be possible to make some sort of calculation regarding the probability of rm being cause of the changes .	0
it turns out , the johns hopkins researchers say , that the ribosome exerts far tighter quality control than anyone ever suspected over its precious protein products which , as workhorses of the cell , carry out the very business of life . " what we now know is that in the event of miscoding , the ribosome cuts the bond and aborts the protein - in - progress , end of story , " says rachel green , a howard hughes medical institute investigator and professor of molecular biology and genetics in the johns hopkins university school of medicine . " there ' s no second chance . " previously , green says , molecular biologists thought the ribosome tightly managed its actions only prior to the actual incorporation of the next building block by being super - selective about which chemical ingredients it allows to enter the process . because a protein ' s chemical " shape " dictates its function , mistakes in translating assembly codes can be toxic to cells , resulting in the misfolding of proteins often associated with neurodegenerative conditions . working with bacterial ribosomes , green and her team watched them react to lab - induced chemical errors and were surprised to see that the protein - manufacturing process did not proceed as usual , getting past the error and continuing its " walk " along the <allcaps> dna </allcaps> ' s protein - encoding genetic messages . " we thought that once the mistake was made , it would have just gone on to make the next bond and the next , " green says . " but instead , we noticed that one mistake on the ribosomal assembly line begets another , and it ' s this compounding of errors that leads to the partially finished protein being tossed into the cellular trash , " she adds . so what is being monitored by the ribosome ? information . material representations ( amino acid sequence vs <allcaps> dna </allcaps> sequence ) of information . but , it does not only monitor it , it manipulates it as a means to an end . <repeated> fidelity .	0

hey , let me jump in on this one . creation science has found nothing . there are no ifs , buts or maybes , on this one . creation science is wrong and has been proven so by the scientific community time and time again . look at pretty much any post on this forum and you will see this . every time a creat brings up an argument , the secular residents of this site beat them down with logic and reason . no creat argument has stood up to the test of science . pure and simple . point me toward the right way then ? if creationists are wrong then why is evolution right ? this is a biased answer based on your beliefs . please tell us how creationists were wrong . i would gladly like to see you try !	1

i am not particularly shocked , nor worried , that the article shows that a particular group is seeking to merge government policy with their ideology . oh my , big shocker there . that is the nature of democracy . the truth is that everyone does this , not just people who happen to be religious . in fact , when you say ' these people need to be stopped , ' you are seeking to have your ideology implemented on society . the problem here is inconsistency in that you seem to think it ok for you to merge your ideology and social policy , but it is not ok for other people to do so . what ? you did not know that religious people are the only ones that are supposed to be silent and never try to take part in democracy , while everyone else gets to do so ? where have you been ? emoticonxdonno i wonder sometimes if opponents of religion really even stop to think about what they are really saying .	0
any novel change / mutation in " expression " at the organismic level that cannot be directly linked to a novel genetic mutation can only be <allcaps> eam </allcaps> , aka devo - evo , ( that is , developmental evolution ) , a neo - lamarkian phenomenon . why ? because such a phenomenon nothing whatsoever to do with the darwinist , " toe " , that is , that such novel trait changes / ' expressions ' originate from - - " random genetic mutation " , coincidentally expressed as some lucky organismic trait that " natural selection " does not eliminate before it is inherited by offspring . and there simply is no genetic mutation here . what it does show , empirically , are that organismic tyraits are not determined by genetic chemicals , but by the organism ' s usage of those chemicals to its own purposes and advantage . i will stop quoting here . do not want people to have too big a read . actually toe is not all that random . to a certain degree yes . but sexual selection aka a part of the toe . dictates that when there is a benificial / attractive change . that change will be enhanced almost exponentially . because the female of the species will be programmed to search for that and will carry the gene herself so will give it to her off spring . and the male will be more succesfull so produce more off spring . so no instant eyes or anything like that . i think that ' s what you were implying . sorry for responding in kronus ' s stead . i am sure he can defend himself but i found it unjust the way you replied to his post and attacked it on foundations that you did not have .	0

we have some major flaws in our legal system . the first and foremost legal flaw is that american prisoners are american people and thus are granted first ammendment american rights . this means that murderers who do not get birthday cakes , a basketball court , tv , and a turkey for thanksgiving go crying cruel and unusual punishment and then they get it . i have heard that the average cost of living of a capital punishment prisoner is appoximately $25,000 . 00 a year paid for by us . it ' s really bad when murderers on deathrow in mexico are calling murderers on deathrow in america p*****s <censored> and want to transfer here . <allcaps> leviathan </allcaps> you know what is far worse than murder itself ? executing people to save some money .	0

your definition is that those creatures with survival advantages and characteristics will survive . no . that ' s not what i said . i said that natural selection is differential reproductive success . i said that those organisms that possessed advantageous characteristics would tend to reach reproductive age more frequently and therefore they will tend to produce more offspring , while those with disadvantageous characteristics will tend to produce fewer offspring . as a result , the heritable characteristics of the population will change over time .	0
you have demonstrated my point . you seem capable of responding to issues in only two ways - either quoting the bible as ' proof ' of something , or pasting in some tedious , non - reputable and peripherally related quote . i say your interactions are not honest because you persist in these diversions , instead of directly answering with ideas that came out of your mind . certainly a discussion of religion may involve the bible , but it does not always have to . you are incapable of understanding that a bible quote is not proof of anything other proving those words are in the bible .

its pretty clear that the attributes of god were made up along the way over the course of history , for different motivations from explaining disasters and natural phenomenon , to comforting greiving loved ones , to controlling the masses and justifying the whims of the rulers . when things started to get hairy in terms of logical contradictions , they threw in " god moves in mysterious ways " and " god ' s ways are higher than ours " , in an attempt to shut up the independent thinkers with questions the priests could not answer . truly genius , the legacy still goes strong to this day . i agree , it is pure genius . <repeated> especially how it has infiltrated politics and governments . emoticonxbanghead	1

im2l844 : the biotic message theory suggest the teleological goal for biotic reality is to communicate to humans that there is one designer and author of life , and that life could not have evolved . oh , is <allcaps> that </allcaps> where you are getting your information ? the biotic message ? i read the book tens years ago and eventually sold it because it wasn ' t worth keeping . you do know that it is a book on biology written not by a biologist , but by an engineer . right ? walter jame remine is a mere engineer of some sort , and has no degree in biology . and biologists strongly argue against his claims . ps : i even had a few exchanges with remine when i was posting at <allcaps> arn </allcaps> . i argued against him , even though i was an idist at the time , because he was not being truthful .	0
you asked a question , i answered . i see now you are just looking for a fight . watch your mouth or your time here will shortly come to an end . did prohibition of alcohol do any good ? nope , just made the criminals all the more powerful . did prohibition of drugs do any good ? nope , just made the criminal all the more powerful . will prohibition of legal firearms do any good ? not a chance in hell . banning legal ownership has never , ever , ever done anything toward ending the illegal use of something . never has , never will . it ' s absolutely impossible and just shows far for withdrawn people are from the real world in their thinking .	0

i agree , no oath should be taken lightly . however , i believe that a certain amount of interpretation is essential , especially in grey areas that medicine can wander into . abortion to save the life of the mother is a grey area that doctors have to wrestle with . separating siamese twins where there is only one heart , allowing one to live while the other dies instead of both dying is a grey area . following an oath such as that to the letter puts things too much in black and white , when a lot of good medicine happens in the shades of grey . in the examples you gave , the doctor is clearly trying his * very best to save the most lives he can . what if the siamese twins were in no mortal danger while together ? and what if one siamese twin has legs but the other does not ? is not the other twin dependent on the one with legs ? could a doctor ethically remove the legless twin if the legged twin wanted to and if the legless twin was retarded and the procedure would leave the legless twin dead ? *( or her best . <repeated> i am sorry but my doctor is male , so i will no longer use " his / her " or " he / she " . <repeated> it just gets tiring after a while . <repeated> )	0

your definition of science is a ' body of knowledge that pertains to reality ?

maybe from 1986 , i am a mite older than that . they can not pass a retroactive law now can they ? mine still says , ' not for identification purposes ' . think they can make that ex post facto ? even the county clerk is not entitled to that information . my birth certificate does not have it either , maybe obama ' s does if we can find the birth certificate and heel print ? when clinton was president , he and lloyd bentsen and his fed chief bundled up all the ss money and sold them off as securities . long before 1986 , the ss money was removed from the account and put in the general fund so they could spend it . look up what date registration became mandatory and try not to be too surprised . i am not in the least surprised . <repeated> i stated that it was required by law . <repeated> i never said anything about when it became a requirement . as of now , in the year 2010 applying for a ss number is required . <repeated> would you say that is an invasion of privacy ? . <repeated> and for your information clinton wasn ' t the first or last president to rape the social security program . <repeated> politicians have been using it as a personal bank for decades .	0

you could go there but it will not change the fact i do not agree with your ideas of what is says . you believe it is saying one thing and i believe it says something else . we have an entire supreme court to do the same sort of interpretation game with our constitution . they sit and make decisions and interpreations based on what they think it says . the bible is the same game . not to me , but let us not quibble about things we can not change . let us talk about something that we can change . <repeated> for a change . we could argue about it forever and never change one thing that ' s written . how about making a proposal suited to fit those whose religious beliefs tend to make us feel inferior ? or passing legislation that more medical staff be trained in ' special ' fields of medicine for certain diseases so that constant referrals will not bounce us off the walls .	1
this entire issue was dealt with on this threat here , starting at post250 . you either did not read my post thoroughly , or are intentional misrepresenting me . post 250 ( which i had actually read before starting this thread ) is nothing but dametel rambling about homologies between vertebrae embryos . that has absolutely nothing to do with the unexplained homologies that the denton talks about . evolution simply cannot , reasonably speaking , account for the homology between your arm and leg , among other examples .	0

what you mean is that we should pretend that creationism has some sort of legitimate basis in reality ? the definitions were accurate . it would be different if someone could actually offer a scientific theory of creation . how about some evidence to support the " theory .

i would argue that the world is in fact buddhist . whether they call their faith or process buddhism or not the experience of suffering and overcome suffering is buddhist by nature . you can see buddhism being embraced in almost every walk of life be it yoga or atheist solutions to problems / suffering , psychology , self help books . they may not call it buddhism but they are most certainly are buddhist principles repackaged in other forms . you are a very good student of buddha . i am very impressed .	0
right . catholics say prayers to a woman that they hate . next ! they sure do , and make sure that there are all those women priests and women cardinals that have a say in the politics of the church . when they sealed the room to choose this current pope , how many women were in that room ? when they were discussing the publication of the last catchiesm , how many women participated ? it ' s easy to pray to a non - corporial image , because that image will not talk back and heavens forbid , give an opinion .	1

to apathy : call me crazy , but i still do not see any evolution in the peppered moths ! <repeated> we had light and dark moths before the industrial revolution , we now still have light and dark moths . the only thing that has changed is the population ratio , assumably by * natural selection * . natural selection is not proof of evolution by any means . creationists recognise it and accept it as it goes in nicely with the creationary model . natural selection is basically the death of a particular type of animal if they are unsuited to the environment . in a given environment ( e . g . a very cold region ) , some ( e . g . the long - haired dogs ) will be more likely to survive , and so pass on their information , than others . natural selection can favour some sets of information above others , and can eliminate some of the existing information in the population , but it can not create any new information . an example , consider the cold environment mentioned above . we take a population of both long , short and medium , haired dogs to this environment . over time , very short time , the population will only consist of the long haired dogs as the short and medium haired dogs would freeze and be wiped out by the cold conditions . so , as a result , the population as a whole has lost the information for making short haired dogs and has not gained any new information . what did we have when we first took the dogs to the environment ? dogs ( varying in hair sizes ) . what did we get after a short amount of time ? dogs ( only the long hair size ) . there is no evolution occuring here , we had dogs before , dogs after . the only difference is that the gene for making short hair has been eradicated from the population by natural selection - - that is it . this is the essense of natural selection - and goes in nicely with the biblical account of our origins , i . e . variation within a kind and that kind ' s have the ability to only lose information - not gain it . so even if the peppered moth case was really true , and not a fraud , it still would not be evidence for evolution as opposed to creation . anyone who says other wise , does not really know what they are talking about unless new genetic information is somehow being added to the moth ' s total <allcaps> dna </allcaps> content , i . e . their genome , in which case you might have a point . would any creationists like to challenge anything about this article or the concept ? his method appears to be good , i . e . using observations and experimental data , as well as repeatability . he is using the scientific method ( in reverse as he is collecting the observations and experimental data and then will draw a conclusion based on the evidence and possibly his own bias . this is yet to be determined , however . can you keep us informed of his progress ? also another example put forward is a bacteria that can only sustain itself by eating nylon . the theory goes - nylon is a recent invention therefore this bacteria must have eolved recently . what it suggests however is that a portion of an existing population would have died if not for nylon . <repeated> the bug has to have nylon , or it will die . it is akin to looking at a portion of the human population who would die from heart - trouble . but thankfully we have now got artificial hearts , therefore this portion can survive . they are not a new species of human , but live only because of a recent invention .	0

since reverend hellhound insists on using an antique definition of ' well - regulated ' , i think it will be interesting to examine an antique definition of ' the people ' . the founders defined ' the people ' rather narrowly . john adams explained that women were not part of ' the people ' because ' nature has made them fittest for domestic cares ' and women were unfit for ' the great business of life , and the hardy enterprises of war , as well as the arduous cares of the state ' . servants and those who did not own land were also not part of the people because they were ' too little acquainted with public affairs to form a right judgement , and too dependent upon other men to have a will of their own . ' ( works of adams 9:37 5 - 378 ) what are you talking about ? ! <repeated> the constitution was written in the late 1700 ' s we have to go by thier meaning not a modern interpretation , this is most silly . as for your quote on adams i do not see how that even remotley applies to this discussion . <repeated> care to expound ?	1
because you are right and they are wrong ? catholics have a different belief . the goal is to always save both mother and child . if the fetus dies during the attempt to save both , then that ' s what happens . for instance , with an ectopic pregnancy , the goal is not to kill he fetus , the goal is to save both mother and fetus .	0

if the only choices we can possibly make are the one god approves , then we dont have free will , because we cannot free choose the option that god does not approve of , which means we are forced to only choose the options that god approves of . this is not free will your right , this is not complete free will . but as i mentioned before , if you give yourself free will , then you are saying god has no control over you or your actions - - and therefore he is not god anymore .	0

some argue that the mountains were not that tall yet . that makes no sense whatsoever given the rates of tectonic plate drift . plates move at 1 inch a year . that ' s 500 feet over 6,000 years . everest is by far taller then that . some argue that plates moved faster . to create everest in 6,000 years would mean plates would have to move almost five feet every year in the same direction . while plate movements are related to the earth ' s core heat , the necessary heat to have that much movement would mean the earth ' s core would have to be hundreds of times hotter . that ' s way more then the surface of the sun . but even worse , even if there were some unknown mechanism to cause such movement , it would generate heat . the heat generated by the creation of the mountains of the world would be more than enough to reduce the entire surface to molten lava . add to that the fact that the condensation of the " vapor canopy " would release enough heat to boil all of the water on earth .	0

the term <allcaps> gay </allcaps> was adopted by the homosexual movement in the hope of evoking a happy existence and persona to the general public that rightfully saw your community for the pathetic self centered existence that it still represents . you may have bought into that image lesz , but i can plainly and clearly see the full extent of the misery index which comes with the homosexual lifestyle . so your claim that your perceived , promoted and alleged happiness as a people is as foolish as your insistence that homosexuality is as right and normal as heterosexuality which is the reason our species is self perpetuating . <url> you actually have some full insight into gays and what we have gone through and think were pathetic . once again insults and a bigoted view archie . you never cease to amaze me .	1
i have to watch for snares now ? <happy> i did not say it , nor does the bible , that only males of the human race have souls . well , assuming that when the bible says " you " in passages that are telling " you " to do something with your soul , i would hope that it also applies to women . but it never comes out and says " women and men have souls . " this does not mean they do not have them . same thing with animals . the book is not written for non - humans , so when it says " you " we can assume it does not refer to non - humans . but the book never says " animals do not have souls . " so we can not assume that they do not ( according to the bible ) .	0
<allcaps> imo </allcaps> , that ' s beside the point . the problem with judicial fiat is that it ' s a way to get things done despite the will of the people . sure , people may still oppose gay marriage even if it ' s done legislatively as opposed to judicially , but at least then they ' d have the chance and opportunity to do so . with only the judicial means , people feel that they have no say whatsoever in something they feel is important . so i think there really is something to this concern than gay marriage is slipped in via judicial fiat . of course you feel they should not have a say , so you have no problem with the idea of doing by judicial fiat . but the whole process was done in the courts using the process set up by the constitution . where the laws are not clear on an issue , such as in massachusetts , it is the courts job to decide . the courts are a check on the injustice towards minorities by the majority .	0
and al shots in the ten range . and in response to zachvac i mean guns not arms ( as in nukes ) but im fine with automatics and such in the right hands . that wasn ' t my question . my question wasn ' t what you said , but what you believed . you sort of answered that . but the same people spouting off about the second ammendment being the reason for guns should also be for it defending your right to a nuclear bomb .	0
i would like to see more conclusive data on the subject but most importantly a <allcaps> real </allcaps> plausible solution . i am not an expert but it does appear most scientists feel global warming is partly man - made . i do get a little sketched out when i see scientists are trying to restrict research for those that go against the theory . they may have strong arguments but that kinda bs really blows your credibility . i see , when you say " i am not an expert " do you mean you are not a climate scientist or do you mean you do not have the scientific knowledge to discuss this ?	0

archangel just does not want gay people to get married because he is mean . he has his marriage and does not want us to be happy . oh yes matt , i am just an angry little ogre who can not stand to think that gays might find happiness in this lifetime , [ sarcasm ] . get a clue matthew , i have no personal investment at all regarding your life or your lifestyle . all i am doing is sharing the spiritual truths that you hate to hear or consider . do not blame me because you live a life of delusions and self deception , because that is the life you are living . and none of those so called good people who encourage and show tolerance for your chosen lifestyle are your friends at all . and yet you prefer their lies to my truth . go figure huh ?	1
just for the sake of argument , let us assume evolutionists had trouble explaining away the tongue of the woodpecker . how in any sense is creationism the alternative ? : well heck , if lifeforms cannot realistically be strung together by small , gradual , materialist increments ( which they can not and there is no evidence for ) then the only alternative is special creation .	0
the california legislature - - the people ' s elected representatives - - have , over the last two years , twice voted to legitimise same - sex marriages in california . that ' s in the last two years , not eight years ago , when the odious , unconstitutional prop . 22 was passed . gov . schwarzenegger vetoed it both times , saying - - contrary to the usual the ' activist judges ' complainants - - that he preferred the court to decide . which it has . tough titty . so a ballot initiative that allowed the citizens of the state to vote on the issue was illegal ? ! <repeated> what dictatorship do you live in that makes a ballot initiative unconstitutional ? oh yeah , i forgot , the district of whatever the poor oppressed gay militants want . so screw the will of the people , just buy the judges and rule through judicial activism .	1
in a few decades , it might be possible that technological progress would develop an " artificial womb " that can nurture a fetus almost from day one until birth . how would that change the abortion debate ? that would most likely ( imo ) reduce the number of abortions performed . it would depend , i think , on how viable it is to transfer the embryo into the artificial womb . forced surgery would not be an option if i had anything to do about it .	0
in typical fashion , and because because your man made science that teaches that the big bang signified the start of time , even though their was evidently no one around to record time back then , but you automatically assume that only after the so called big bang did time begin to exist . look , the " no one was around to see it " argument . " if a tree falls in the woods , and no one was around to see it , did it really fall ? " you lost this one a long time ago , too . you never learn .	1
this would also explain why evolutionists cannot give us any example of random mutations that could lead to cumulative selection - - because they do not exist . s look up the evolution of colour vision in primates . it ' s my personal favourite - but what do you think ?	0
first paragraph : " christianity is living a lifstyle patterned after the teachings , actions and philosophies of christ . " sure , not a bad definition . " in order to do this , you must accept that the records of christ ' s life are fact . " every single word in the gospels ? no , not at all . remember , the works which became the new testament were around for centuries before they were actually compiled into the bible . and none of the originals still exist . who knows what changes were made to the account of jesus ' s life before they were finally compiled . for example , look at matthew 10:34 " do not think that i came to bring peace on earth . i did not come to bring peace but a sword . " does not sound much like jesus , does it ? it certainly does not fit into the picture that ' s generally painted of jesus . in the end the new testament was written and compiled by mistake prone people . some may believe that it ' s the unadulterated word of god , but looking at the above passage it ' s also easy to believe that it ' s also the work of common people . the rest of the paragraph rather depends on accepting that line , and i believe i have shown that a reasonable person might not , so i am going to skip to your next paragraph . so what about jesus ' life is credible if the source is unreliable ? was it that jesus didnt walk on water but he fed 5000 with 5 loaves ? was it that he didnt forgive the samaritan harlot but he raised lazarus from the dead ? what did the authors get right ? i mean , i can easily believe jesus said he came to bring a sword and not peace . but you dont . so how do we possibly pattern our lives according to how jesus lived if we dont know whether what they recorded was actually what he did ? it is necessary to believe that the gospels are true , otherwise you cannot follow a pattrn you dont have .	0

sorry to burst your bubble , but non - gene inheritance is non - materiastic inheritance , which absolutely does contradict toe . ( how exactly does it happen that thought or awareness generates a new physical trait and then pass it down ? ) and never has it been proven that any spontaneous , randomly - occurring mutation has ever created a beneficial , selectable morphological novelty , so ultimately , it ' s your materialist theory that has no evidence . i have evidence , you do not . honk ! wrong . my parents inherited a house from their parents . they also inherited knowledge and were taught certain values . concepts stored in one brain , expressed via words and encoded in a new brain . epigenetic inheritance , yet still materialistic . does not mean they did not also inherit a bunch of genes , and for the umpteenth time it does not mean they get to screw their face up like hiro and tweak them whenever they like . should not i be asking you that , since that ' s what you say happens , despite having exactly zero evidence to back it up ? honk ! what a great big fat juicy lie , ss . do not put it in the keep net though ; toss it back so you can use it again later .	1
hey , whatever works for you ! i guess its ok to explore certain sides of your personality , and its always good to get out and meet new people and try new things . just be careful what you pick up i totally agree . you never know what you might pick up . but he likes to eat hey ? that ' s weird . but to each his own . i like to eat more normal food myself . but if you explore certain sides of someones personality , do you really learn anything ? how do you know you just do not watch and then five minutest after you explore the personality , you forgot everything about that person . i mean , i do not know , but i have some trouble picking up on personalities right away of people i meet . has anyone ever tried spilling tuna on the floor on purpose ? i am just wondering because that would be weird .	0

the holocaust by the nazis against the jewish people , was the genocidal elimination of an entire race of people who were indigenous to the country , betrayed by the very government that they believed would protect them . the jewish people committed no crimes , they were simply made the villain and wiped out by the government . illegal immigrants are not indigenous to the country , are committing various crimes against the country and the people , putting us at massive risk , and doing parasitic harm to the nation . the law passed does not authorize their death , it just cracks down on them being here illegally . there ' s absolutely no comparison between what germany did , and what arizona is doing . there you are <allcaps> nato </allcaps> , you have justified a final solution for the " mexican problem " . let me quote you	1
sorry my brain wasn ' t working that early this morning . what i was trying to say was i can not understand those who wish to completely take guns away from civilians . now i think it does get a little extreme with owning several m - 1 6 s , but if i want to own a pistol , a shotgun , and some fancy automatic , well that ' s my right . well , maybe the pistol and the hunting rifle , what do you need an automatic weapon ? have the deer gotten faster ?	1
did your thought process ever include the question : what choice does the " victim " have ? does the instinct to survive exist in the helpless ? the being that is totally dependent on the being that brought about it ' s existence becoming a victim of that being entrusted with it ' s safe keeping you mean like a tapeworm ? should removing tapeworms be illegal too ?	1
i believe there is special dispensation for those who have never had a chance to hear the good news . the last pope mentioned something dealing with this a few years ago <allcaps> iirc </allcaps> . this is also why the great commision for christians is evangelism . but you know what really does not make sense ? why are they evangelising to people ( who they know most of them will reject them ) if those people get a special dispensation ? they ' d be condemning people to hell by evangelizing , would they not ? why not leave the people be and let them get the special dispensation ? emoticonxconfused	0
but evolutionists are just as religious as christians : they have their own unseen miracles – ( random mutations ) … . their own clergy ( scientists ) … their own bible ( the origin of species ) . <repeated> and their own god ( natural selection ) . well said . with this religion , the gap is very wide between the " average guy " and " authority " , because their clergy is more involved in politics than the clergy of christianity , or the creator himself . it fits with more democrats being evolutionists , and more democrats favoring bigger domestic government .	0
keep in mind two important points : 1 . reason does not imply truth , it ' s a method of seperating truth from what is false , and you can quite easily ( and do every day ) , reason something to a false conclusion . 2 . you can believe whatever you like , and it can certainly impact your life ( faith ) , however it cannot be said that faith is based on rational belief , or takes part in reason , in any way , it is the opposite of reason . if information came into being by chance , how can we know that anything is true ? how do you know what is false and what is " true " ? if we are just products of chance , your brain is also a product of chance . therefore , the thought patters that determine your logic are also products of chance . if your logic is the result of chance processes , you can not even be sure it evolved properly . you can not even be sure you can reason properly ( using your definition ) because you can not trust your own logic . as for the second part , no , you have got it backward , rational belief is based on faith in a rational creator . references <kiss> the creationist basis for modern science . * the lie : evolution ~ ken ham . * evolution : fact or fiction ? ~ john blanchard .	0
i agree with you . do i want abortion to used for birth control ? no . <repeated> as you say , i agree things need to be looked at on a case by case bases ; thats what choice is unless there are criteria . but again i agree , i can not set the criteria as well . you and i surely do not want the deaths back . be it 10,000 or 80,000 . clearly we agree . progress . not only is phyllis right in calling you what you are but you clearly ignore reality . you were already called on using incorrect facts once . <repeated> you might as well say " denying abortion will cause 10000000 bagillion deaths a day "	1
you mean like sodom and gomorrah ? did you forget that ? in a similar way , sodom and gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion . they serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire . - jude 7 and you should not forget the thousands of gays incinerated at this death camp ! <repeated>	1
so they ( pro - life peeps ) say abortion is murder . of course , you can only murder people . so their rule is that fetuses ( feti ? ) are people also . but then they can not explain why fetuses are not listed on the us census , or why there is not a funeral every time a woman has a miscarriage . pretty much , along with the rules of having children , you would have to acquire the birth certificate during conception , you would have to pay taxes for children , even if you are only pregnant , etc . or am i missing something ? care to clarify , anybody who disagrees ? unriggable , your statement should read the so - called " pro - life " since they are anything but .	1
while you see the need to not only debate him on points , then post an expose about your ideas of his capability , i am still curious why you like to discuss why a tautology is a tautology . how does the phrase ' survival of the fittest ' change in any way , what evolution is , the evidence that supports it , and the fact that there simply is no strong evidence for any other mechanism by which humans have come to be , on earth ? i ask because i assume you must think there is some relevance to the discussion of creation vs evolution . there might not be , that ' s ok too , i ' d just like to make sure we do not put words in your mouth . - mach yes , how silly of me to debate him on ' points ' . i should debate him on . <repeated> what ? and here you are again criticising one side , and not the other . he was insulting ; you remained stony silent . because he denies that darwin ever used it . darwin did . small point but he entered into all sorts of highly spurious rationales rather than accepting this point ( again you were stony silent on this ) what is evolution ? what is evidence ? well that would be a first time . but why ask now , after several days , after he ' s gone by the wayside , after he made the claim again and again and again ? you made no statement while he was claiming this false claim ? why your sudden interest in digging all posts i have responded too ?	1
if only more people were armed this tragedy might have been minimised . so how is the oil and gas agreement with china working out for you antipodeans ?	1
of course they do . ditto squared . if they support killing a perfectly healthy unborn child , they will argue that the reason stated in the op is the main reason abortion is needed and justified . and i must say that if 98% of all abortions were performed for that reason , the public stance against them might not be so strong .	0

but at no time has anyone offered any actual evidence to prove anything i have said wrong . <repeated> archie , you have said so many incorrect things about evolution on this thread that it ' s hard to know where to begin . the idea that ' evolution teaches essentially that a fish walked out of the ocean and survived long enough to become a mammal ' springs readily to mind .	1
any two adults can run the household , one can make the decision if the other is incapacitated , one inherits when the other dies , etc etc . that parallel does not carry over to group marriages . when one dies , who inherits ? if one is incapacitied , who decides what the treatment should be ? basically , pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that are on the book make any sense for groups of more than two , so recongnising group marriages is a huge legal task , and one for which the outcomes are far from obvious . if we are talking about legal recognition , and we are ( right ? ) , then the cases are wildly different . our marriage laws , for better or worse , are set up on the assumption of two adults running a household . they also assume man and wife , true , but do not actually depend on that . but the dependence on there being two people is embedded in the laws ; changing that is a huge project . yes , but gays would also want laws changed to accomodate <allcaps> their </allcaps> form of marriage as well . the fact that one requires less change than the other should not matter , should it ? should having to do more reworking of laws and more paperwork hinder the pursuit of equality ? it seems to me your argument boils down to " polygamy requires more work to make the laws accomodate it . " yeah - - such is the price for marriage equality . let us face it - - if society really wanted to make marriage an open - ended institution of equality rather than for opposite - sex couples which comprise most relationships , they could pull it off - - polygamy , gays , letting 17 year olds marry , etc . all those civil servants are there and can do it as directed as legislation is changed . means could be set up to determine inheritance , for example . laws can be worded to do it .	0

even better were does it say that evolution is proven ? in the thousands of scientific papers that present the thousands of bits of evidence that go to prove evolution beyond all sensible sane and reasonable doubt .	1
plus there are so many other sciences that are lumped with evolution , incorrectly by those who do not understand evolution . talking about the evolutionist theories about the big bang is pretty mindless , since the big bang is cosmology . whether or not there was or was not a big bang is irrelevant to evolutionary biology . lumping other sciences under " evolution " is a method of creationists so that they can claim that they do not oppose " science " but only evolution . to be a creationist is to reject the last 400 years of science - cosmology , astronomy , astrophysics , nuclear physics , geology , paleontology , tectonics , biogeography , genetics , population genetics , and so on . you get the idea .	0

the more we seek to redefine marriage , and chip away at god ' s original design for the home , the more we put our families and our nation at risk . how do you know what god ' s original design for the home was ? how do you know that god did not create homosexuals for a reason ( i . e . helping raise children of people who can not care for them ) ? how is allowing 2 people who commit to love eachother for life putting heterosexual families and the nation at risk ? at risk from what ? this debate about gay marriage is really just the latest outgrowth of a culture that for decades has been drifting from biblical standards of truth and morality . the sexual revolution , for example , sought to bring legitimacy to sex outside of marriage . the women ' s liberation movement worked to revolutionize the roles of men and women in marriage and in our society . throw in a rising emphasis on materialism and personal happiness , and you end up with a dramatically new way of looking at marriage . when millions of americans view marriage from the mindset of “ what ' s in it for me ? ” concepts like responsibility , self - sacrifice , and lifelong commitment become secondary . is it any wonder that our divorce rate is so high ? or that the number of children born outside of marriage continues to rise ? or that an increasing number of couples are opting to live together instead of marrying ? and now the push for gay marriage seeks to redefine marriage even further . from the moment god created marriage , it was designed with a man and woman in mind . god designed two sexes male and female — he did not create four sexes . homosexual marriage cannot fulfill god ' s purposes for marriage . i realize we are not all christians here . however , this issue of gay marriage transends all of society and it will have a negative effect on all of us . <allcaps> jmho </allcaps> . i disagree . i have been in a loving , committed relationship for 25 years to the same person exclusively . <repeated> how does this have a negative affect on you ?	0

maybe , but he ' s no centrist and with the way the congress looks he will most likely put very anti - gun judges in the supreme court , which means the 2 nd amendment would be pretty much dead . do not believe me ? look at california . stupidest laws we have and they do not even work ! criminals still steal and buy illegal weaponry . the judges here are so far left , they themselves admit it ! ( look up judge reinhardt . ) i am not saying being a lefty is bad , it ' s just that it seems some would throw away a right just to " feel " safe . that ' s the worse thing <allcaps> you </allcaps> can do . that just sounds alarmist to me . do you realize the actual implications of taking away second amendment rights ? it is just not going to happen .	0
i explicitly told you i was a catholic before ' converting ' to objectivism , so forgive me for not being impressed with your powers of speculation . that does not change the fact that this was all well before i signed onto this forum so i know xcaliber has no quotes . i do not ' lean that way ' just because i reject irrational evolution . i did not learn this skepticism from my catholic upbringing , as noted several times catholics are ambiguous towards evolution . sorry but i do not read your posts , do you think i worship your word or something ?	1
if creationism replaced science ? first , we ' d have to discard the fact that the earth is billions of years old . second , we ' d have to discard the facts of the order of appearance of organisms , and switch back to the incorrect chronology listed in genesis . third , we ' d have to reclassify bats as birds . fourth , we ' d have to scrap the fully supported fact and theory of evolution . fifth , we ' d have to go back to believing that people think with their hearts . and so on , and so on . you forgot to mention that we would have to change our numbering system so that grasshoppers had 4 legs .	1
as i have mentioned many times in these forums , one ' s personal view of abortion ( i . e . , whether it should be prohibited or permitted ) has nothing whatsoever to do with whether roe v . wade should be overturned . if one supports the rule of law , then they would have to support the statement made by senator mccain . also , given that you do not like his stated position on gay marriage ( i . e . , that marriage is a state issue ) , it appears to me that you do not like democracy either . ah , so i do not like democracy , and yet it is you who in the post are telling me that i have to support mccain ' s statement . are you serious ? that sure does not sound like democracy to me . i also find it funny that you claim that i do not like democracy when my very post stated that i would be voting for the democrat party . but then , i guess if we do not support bushyboy and his fellow republicanazis , we must be against democracy , right ? get real , phyllis .	1

here in san francisco , hiv is talked about all the time . a frank discussion on the national level would be a welcome change , especially since the bush administration wants to cut back on the prevention programs that have worked here . and here are a couple more articles : new cases of hiv in san francisco dipped nearly 10% in the last five years , marking the first drop in infections since the late 1 9 8 0 s , according to preliminary estimates from the city ' s department of public health . the first one is from sfgate , so you probably will not trust it , tainted as it is by just being in san francisco . la is probably too librul for you to trust , too , so you may just have to google and see if fox covered the decrease in rates . <url> <url> this seems like a begging the question fallacy . lets just assume that they ' do not ' have control over it . <repeated> it would be the same thing for an alcoholic ( which people are also born with ) . are you saying alcoholics should be allowed to live in this lifestyle ? i guess it is societies fault emoticonxrolleyes looks like jyoshu ' s reactions were correct for you i am pretty surprised no one is like ' yeah , this is still a problem ' . <repeated> instead they are going ' 25% . <repeated> that aint too bad ' . even worse , they blame other people . in fact , robbie says gay men are acting ' recklessly ' because they are not treated as ' normal ' , yet he believes that gay men are ready to have families . how can you be reckless yet be ready for a family ? . <repeated> or rather , a good family ?	1

i read it the first time . your are trying to argue that your experience was somehow unique and the way it happened excludes you from those who do what everyone else is doing . there is absolutely nothing in your personal story that is remarkable in anyway . as i said before just because you don ’ t realize it doesn ’ t mean that it is not influencing you to do what everyone else is doing . it happens to everyone including stupid arrogant people with an i ’ m special attitude . your thinking is so screwed up that it precludes from knowing that . you really think your something special but you ’ re not your just another brain dead clone . where do you get off saying that kind of tripe to somebody ? that kind of insane comment is typical of far left loons like you who lie for a living and do not have the common sense of a fence post . and that goes for jo bennett too if he ' s agreeing with you . cretins .	1
if you think evolution cannot explain any change then why pick the avian lung in particular ? maybe try and show how genesis can integrate almost or more observations in a meaningful way than evolution , then genesis competes , otherwise it does not . because if evolution cannot explain all changes it is false , unless you propose some creatures evolved and some were specially created . is that what you mean ? genesis says that all creatures were specially created . it fits with the observational evidence but there is no smoking gun that proves it . statis is the norm not the exception . one is right the other wrong . it cannot be both ways . do you have an answer to how a lizard can morph into a bird considering the amazing difference in the lungs ?	0

do not deceive yourself into thinking that " literal " biblical creation would be proved true if evolution were proven false . we would need a third theory . actually there are already a couple floating around . one fascinating one : gaia theory and the daisyworld model . it ' s all around self - organising systems and the earth as a self - regulating system / organsism / something or other . james lovelock and co . interesting to read but sometimes feels a little too ' lets - all - just - get - along ' to be real , hard - core theory . either way , it ' s probably a lot more likely to be accepted than creationism , should evolutionism for some reason be disproved .	0

often abortion supporters convey their message as one of championing the cause of freedom of choice and resistance of the oppression of others values on women . perhaps this should be posted as a poll but i wonder if this support for " choice " remains consistent . do those who support the choice of abortion also support the choice to bear children ? do they abhor the imposition of the one child rule on the women of china for example ? the woman ' s choice is restricted and the ideals of the government are imposed upon her . do those here who support the freedom of choice of abortion denounce china ' s policies and support the freedom of choice of bearing children ? there are also some areas in india where a person running for an elected office cannot have more than two children ( there are obvious implications of this policy on what the makeup of the ruling government will be and how it will institute policy ) . do those supporting the choice of abortion denounce this policy as a restriction of choice ? or do environmental and population concerns outweigh and assume more importance than the freedom of choice in the above examples ? well , i can not speak for anyone else , but i support any choice that the woman wants to make . no , i do not support forced abortions anywhere , i do not support what ' s going on in china and india because they are still taking a choice away from the women . what i do not get is that many prolifers think that prochoicers are <allcaps> only </allcaps> for the choice of abortion . all the prochoicers i know support any choice the woman feels right about making . for example , i was called a hypocrite because i am prochoice and pregnant . the person said " you are forcing others to abort while you carry to term .

asahi . com ? <repeated> unloaded rifle on tv triggers controversy - englishotsu , shiga prefecture - - given this nation ' s strict gun control law , were police overreacting when they swooped on a tv broadcaster that had allowed a celebrity to handle a hunting rifle during a live broadcast ? the shiga prefectural police insist they were perfectly within their rights , but tv networks are outraged , citing the fact the weapon was not loaded . the incident stems from a show aired jan . 17 by biwako broadcasting co . almost four months later , police mounted a search of the premises and confiscated a dozen items , including a script and a <allcaps> dvd </allcaps> of the show . critics accuse the police of being overzealous and question their motives , but law enforcement officials remain unrepentant . shiga prefectural police regard the incident , in which a hunter with a gun permit allowed tv personality noburo harada , 57 , to momentarily handle the rifle during the show , as a serious breach of a law concerning the storage and management of firearms . so much so , in fact , that on june 12 , the prefectural police referred the case to prosecutors . as a result , the hunter , aged 49 , along with a 60 - year - old tv producer and a 37 - year - old director of the show , could face charges of violating the swords and firearms control law . police did not pursue a case against harada even though he briefly handled the weapon . police argued that he did not actually " possess " the rifle because the hunter handed it to him in an unscripted moment during the broadcast . police justified their search on grounds that they needed to determine if the law concerning the storage and management of firearms had been broken . the show , called " tokimeki shiga ' s , " is broadcast one saturday a month . in the show , harada visits various locations in the prefecture as a travel guide . the program in question was set in yogo , where harada and other cast members were served a pot of wild boar meat . the hunter who had killed the boar appeared in the scene . he offered the unloaded weapon to harada and asked , " do you want to hold it ? " harada held the rifle and commented , " it ' s heavy , is not it ? " adding , " not everybody has a chance to hold it , right ? " he held the firearm for six seconds and then gave it back . biwako broadcasting says the scene in which the hunter handed over the rifle was not in the script and was improvised . the tv crew decided to display the rifle on the show after the hunter told the director he had no problem with the idea at a preliminary meeting . the prefectural police began their investigation after a complaint by a viewer . the intervention by the police flabbergasted harada and employees of other tv stations . " i never could have imagined anything like this , " harada , a former member of the male comedy duo anonenone , told reporters after he was questioned by police on june 2 . " i was stunned . " akihiko ito , head of the tv station ' s programming department , said the station would cooperate with police , but defended harada ' s actions . " we consulted our lawyers , and it is hard to believe that touching a rifle for about six seconds is equivalent to possessing it , " he said . a spokesperson with a tv station based in osaka sharply criticized police . " they should have at least asked ( biwako broadcasting ) to cooperate voluntarily , " a spokesperson said . " from a common sense standpoint , we cannot even comprehend what the police were thinking . " an employee at another tv station was also critical . " if we , for example , were to produce a program about a knife shop and an actor picked up a large knife , would the police investigate us , too ? " the employee asked . " such an overreaction would be intimidating toward people trying to do their jobs . this would ultimately undermine viewer interest in programming . " but police say they do not understand what all the fuss is about . they say the media has , by focusing on the celebrity angle , blurred the facts in the case . a senior official with the shiga prefectural police said the real issue is not that harada briefly held the rifle , but whether bringing the rifle to the live broadcast was appropriate in terms of " storage and management . " an explanation for the police tactics may lie in the revised gun control law , which took effect in january . the law was tightened after a 37 - year - old man in sasebo , nagasaki prefecture , shot and killed two people and wounded six in december 2007 . the man , known for erratic behavior , committed suicide after the shooting . the incident called into question whether existing regulations regarding gun permits and firearm storage were adequate . " i believe the hunter who handed the rifle to the actor and the tv crew lacked an awareness of the firearm ' s potential danger , " another police official said . according to the national police agency , police can file a case against anybody if he or she , with criminal intent to kill or injure people , possesses a weapon for even a second . a case can be built based not on the length of time of possession , but on the purpose of possession , the presence of criminal intent and whether the suspect tricked or maneuvered the gun owner . the shiga prefectural police justify the raid on the grounds that they had to find out how it was possible to bring a gun to the show . by transporting the gun to the show , the hunter may have violated the rules under which he was granted a gun permit , police asserted . they defended questioning harada and the crew as crucial to ferreting out the real issue - - did those involved in the program improperly store and manage the weapon ? takaaki hattori , professor of media law at rikkyo university in tokyo , says that police went too far . " the way the police conducted their investigation is not convincing . i sense they were trying to use the media to sell the public on the revised gun control law , " he said . " they should have been more cautious about the exercise of power by public authorities . " but he also said the broadcaster could have been more prudent . " the tv station should consider whether it was absolutely necessary to use a gun in making the show . the gun owner may have been primarily responsible , but the broadcaster is also to blame for lacking awareness of the law . " takaaki matsumiya , professor of criminal law at ritsumeikan university school of law in kyoto , disagrees that the tv station or the hunter were in any way culpable and lays the blame on the authorities . citing a precedent set by the tokyo high court in june 1967 , he said : " the high court decided that the act of touching a handgun for dozens of seconds by a man brokering the sale of a handgun during the transfer did not constitute ' possession , ' " he said . " there have been no precedents to alter that interpretation . harada did not ' possess ' it ( during the show ) . " matsumiya also defended the hunter who brought the rifle to the set . " when the precedent concludes that a person ' has no legitimate reason ' for bearing and carrying a firearm , it assumes that he or she was going to do harm or ran a risk of doing harm , " he said . " it is obvious that was not the case under these circumstances . " ( <allcaps> iht </allcaps> / asahi : july 2,2009 ) now then , what ' s all this bull * * * * about how other industrialized nations are better off with regard to guns when compared to america ? i do not see such being the case , do you ? if you can not even touch a gun that somebody hands you to examine without breaking the law , that is a serious violation of human rights and everything else . how can japan be so much better off than we are , if it ' s a crime for somebody to hand you a rifle to look at but not to keep ; especially when it ' s unloaded ? ! <repeated> a taste of what could be our future if the left has its way .	0

there are many , many , many people who have done work to stop / block gay marriage and other gay rights when they , themselves , are not gay . that is not merely passing judgement - that is imposition . all i am asking here is that archie , you , jp , etc . own that . to the extent that working toward social change on any moralistic issue is an ' imposition ' , sure . but i think one could say that about anything that has a social effect .	0
i did comment by saying that it ' s all the more reason to make civil unions legal nationwide , with couples ' benefits . regarding your frustration with analogies , analogy is a common tool in discussion and debate . if you do not like analogies , i will be sure and point that out the next time a gay lobbyist here uses one , such as comparing gay marriage to interracial marriage ( such as when invoking the loving case ) . i will ask you yet again who these nefarious ' gay lobbist ' are that you continually refer to ? how do you define ' lobbist ' . merriam - webster on line dictionary <url> are you not yourself a ' lobbyist ' ? many times one thinks of a lobbyist as one who is paid to present a particular point of view . with that in mind : 1 ) are you receiving wages during the time you spend reading and posting on this forum ? i am not . 2 ) is the person or organization paying you those wages aware of the nature your activities here in this forum ? 3 ) does the person or organization paying you those wages advocate the nature of your opinions and activities expressed here in this forum ? 3 ) are you using equipment or facilities provided by some other person or organization to read and make postings here ?	1
" the sword of <allcaps> truth </allcaps> " <allcaps> scoff </allcaps> ! why must truth be accompanied with a tool of violence ? only the religious possess the shameless audacity of claiming exclusive possession of truth and backing their claims with <allcaps> violence </allcaps> . religion / christianity is negated by the very <allcaps> fact </allcaps> it is violent and indeed " lunatic " ! and once again ( s ) he rambles on while responding to nothing said in the prior post . at least you are consistent in your irrational hate speech . <allcaps> btw </allcaps> , the term sword of truth implies no violence against anyone at all . except in the mind of paranoid hate mongers , that is . emoticonxgood	1
it ' s not sexual assault if she ' s not mentally incapacitated i think . if she brushes her teeth and does other things to suggest she ' s drunk rather than fully mentally incapacitated and then has sex , why is it sexual assault ? - wez < sarcasm mode on > it ' s sexual assault because when she sobered up and realized what she ' d done , the little darling could not possibly have been responsible for her own actions . < sarcasm mode off >	1
um , that would be murder , which is against the law and does harm the person being murdered . a union between 2 mutually loving people does not even begin to compare to that . how about small cute animals ? whare is the line of what religion allows , and law forbids ? we know it is not where harm comes to another person , or poligamy would be legal	1
hmm <elongated> , posting person information online about someone that could result in harm to the person among other things . seems a lot like the " knowthyneighbor " bs you support foundit . now you will come up with some lame excuse for a difference between the two but in the end both are bad ways to deal with the issue . and you will cowardly ignore the validity of the difference , as you whine that there is one . <repeated> a person goes to the doctor , that information is <allcaps> not </allcaps> public information . a doctor / patient can claim doctor / patient confidentiality . it ' s a recognized and valid situation . but with the " knowthyneighbor " , these polls are <allcaps> public knowledge </allcaps> . the purpose of publicizing them is to prevent fraud . if you were not so intent on trying to bash , you would recognize the obvious distinctions . <repeated> emoticonxrolleyes	0

so what activates genes ? when a gene product is needed , a signal from its environment , not an emergent property of the gene itself , activates experession of that gene . in otherwords , it ' s the environment , stupid . " pg / 52 so what you are saying is simply that the genes do not actively control the body . what is wrong with assuming that genes therefore do not control the body is the fact that the genes were the blueprint for the body . the genes decided the arrangement of cells , the number of fingers , etc . the body , the cells , and the organelles within the cells are therefore strongly influenced by the <allcaps> dna </allcaps> sequence .	0
like stem cell research , same - sex marriage and speaking in tongues ? wait , scratch the last one , that ' s his normal speech pattern . i meant hearing voices in his head giving him direction . here ' s the thing about stem cell research . <repeated> how would stem cell research go against the christian faith . does it go against christ to heal the sick ? medicnes could improve greatly with the use of stem cell research . i will quicky mention 2 people ( 1 still alive and one dead ) who could have ( or could be ) greatly healed with stem cell research . for one , christerpher reeves could have still been alive if stem cell research could have been done . michael j . fox ( and others with parkingson ' s ( sp ? ) disease ) could be greatly helped with the use of stem cell research . oh , and one other thing . bush has no family values . not just tearing apart gay families but also straight families . he sends husbands / fathers , wives / mother ' s , sons and daughters over to fight a war that we have no business in being in anyway .	0
want the list of military actions he engaged in as president ? is hillary clinton a truthful politician ? perhaps ' truthful politician ' is an oxymoron . if her robust commentary on the iranian regime is not just an attempt to appease ( some ) republican sentiment in her bid for the presidency , then she should state what ' clear and unequivocal ' policy she recommends that the united states should adopt in order to deal with the threat from iran . i do not think she will make clear what aggressive option she favours , if any - at least during her presidential campaign - on the grounds that it might offend ( some ) democratic sentiment . james .	1
no you did not , here ' s what you posted - what am i to infer or understand based on the underlined ? it says ' ice lay beneath the surface ' ? <repeated> what surface ? the surface now ? the surface 65 million years ago ? are you still trying to assert that the ice from 65 million years ago should somehow be present today ? how am i supposed to get ' surface as below the surface ice that is 2000 - 4000 years old ' from that ? type what you mean clearly arch , we can not interpret your convoluted thinking . are you asking about the land under the ice which they are now coring ? google ' arctic geology ' ' antarctic geology ' or ' greenland geology ' for the answers to that . what does this have to do with anything ? i am completely lost . maybe it ' s me . waxy <url> but what does this have to do with the topic at hand ?	0
so , you do not judge ! then it ' s okay to lump all christians together ! evidently , that makes it all better ! so much for being a free - thinker . but then again , you never addressed the issue i asked you about slavery . you claimed to be moral , based on democratic ideals of moarlity . <repeated> but democracy would have very likely continued slavery in the <allcaps> usa </allcaps> ! it was christians who aimed higher . i am sorry if you want to talk past that , and say i disgust you . uh <elongated> , i just said that <allcaps> i do judge </allcaps> ! so what in the hell are you talking about ? you are not well . i did not bother to adress your points about slavery because there ' s no point . i disagree with your claims as i suspect would most historians . but it does not surprise me that christians would try to claim that they ended slavery since they also try to falsely claim they founded the country .	1

foundit , obviously you have never actually bothered to read the libertarian position on marriage , which is to replace it with contract law , before complaining about it . contract law easily covers phenomena like divorce . if you spent 5 seconds researching the issue you would realise this . your ' one big example ' is one big strawman , as usual . and yes , as above , ron paul ' s position , which is less strong , is to get the federal government out and leave it to the states . it ' s not a state ' s issue from a gay rights perspective , if the supreme court of the us rules that discrimination of same - sex couples is illegal in marriage , as it did for inter - racial couples . what would this proposed new contract that resembles marriage , be called ? we already have such a contract . there ' s no need to totally re - invent the wheel at this particular time . foundit is correct . it ' s telling that this issue only comes up when people are looking for a way to not recognize gay couples in marriage .	0

why should people be allowed to vote on my marriage ? this question is premised on an untenable assumption : that people should not be allowed to vote on particular issues . this premise is clearly not true in any democratic society , and is especially not true in the united states . in the united states , it is a contradiction in terms to say someone is not allowed to vote on x . i have demonstrated this before , and yet the same silly question keeps coming up .	0

true perhaps . the ba ' ath party sanctioned all of the killings of innocent civilians back then . ragged militias ? you clearly have no grasp on the nature of the militias that we are fighting in iraq . they are organized , well funded , well supplied , and highly motivated . we certainly could reign all of the militias in if we really wanted to , but the world would probably not approve of the method . so what of it ? do not think i am going to sit here and defend bush . i have n control over what the man says and when he says it . personally , i stopped listening to what he had to say a long time ago . what reasons to be specific ? why do not you spell them out for the whole class to hear . hmm so all you guys have achieved is make a bad situation in iraq infinitely worse and you ask the reasons why the whole world hate you ? go to iraq and ask the people there what do they think of you and take the whole class with you including the teacher . so how would you reign in the militias , what is your method the world would probably not approve of ?	1

i agree . i do not agree with us being in iraq but now that we shattered their security , we have to fix it again . we can not leave without cleaning everything up . that ' s like saving an animal in the woods from a predator and then just setting it free in the middle of new york city . we have to return it to a state where it can function on its own . you mean like korea ? oh wait we are still there . <repeated> is israel a nice secure place safe from terrorism ? the notion that iraq will be without conflict will not occur in our life time .	1

ssues i raised in my op regarding the initial formation of breasts . what issues ? you drivel on about breasts forming on lizards ( even though the most primitive milk secretors we have today do not have anatomically distinct mammary glands , and the earliest mammals evolved from reptiles not remotely like lizards ) , then triumphantly crown your straw man with what you seem to think is a knock - down point about nerve connections . yes , ss , the most primitive milk - secreting structures we know are modified sweat glands ; your incredulity does not alter that fact one iota . and guess what ? sweat glands have nerve connections to the hypothalamus . <repeated>	0

what ' s the difference between humans and chimps ? according to the blowhards in the scientific world for the past 60 years , they said it was genetic mutations . but according to these three articles , including a september 2006 science article it ' s cooked food and fire . <repeated> you see these things cause our genes to be expressed differently . . <repeated> we think gene expression is a major part of what separates chimps and humans , " said kevin white , an associate professor of genetics , ecology and evolution at yale university in the united states . when we looked at gene expression , we found fairly small changes in 65 million years of macaque , orangutan and chimpanzee evolution , " said dr yoav gilad of the university of chicago , lead author of the study . but he said it was followed by quick changes in specific groups of genes known as transcription factors , which control the expression of other genes , since humans diverged from their ape ancestors during the last 5 million years . " this rapid evolution in transcription factors occurred only in humans , " gilad added in a statement . . <repeated> the article is saying that it was genetic changes . changes in genes encoding certain transcription factors is what caused changes in the expression of other genes .	0
there is nothing at all absurd about this take . the gay agenda has been to normalize homosexuality and what better way to do it than to indoctrinate the young and desensitize them to the negatives of the lifestyle while they are still impressionable . that way they know that within 20 years they will have normalized this abnormal lifestyle . you forgot about the youth recruitment efforts as well . i am president of the local chapter of " get ' em while they are young .

unkerpauliei think your analogy breaks down with a little thought . if i have a check for a million dollars and i take it to a copy machine and make a copy , i am quite aware that the copy will not be perfect . there is an imperfect mechanical divice between the check and the copy . or are you saying that god has a big imperfect copy machine that he jumps into and out pops an imperfect copy . my thought was that god was the direct agent of creation ( without the use of intervening mechanical devices ) , and being a perfect being incapable creating imperfection ( for then he would not be god ) , all of his creation would be as perfect as he is . so does this perfect god have a spine that is a plethora of engineering disasters ? an image is not the original . a photo of you is not you , its an image of you . the image cannot be or replace the original , and isnt intended toregardless of how " perfect " the photocopier is , you cannot cash the " perfect " copy of the check . it may be a perfect replica , to the detail , but it is still only an image . the problem isnt the quality of the copying process , but the fact that the copy itself is just that , a copy , not the original	0
polgamy is against the law , living your life as a lesbian is not . that is why i said if i saw a polygamous marriage situation , i would contact the authorities , because in more cases than none ; young women are being taken advantage of by someone much older ; the tom green situation . but , the way your life is lived , i would protect to my last breath and continue to work for equality for one and all . should we clear up what we are talking about at all ? i think adultery is legal in 24 states , and i am pretty sure adultery laws have been pretty much completely unenforced since world war ii . i do not know of any states where a polygamous relationship with no marriage involved is illegal . now , certainly having multiple marriage licenses is illegal . <repeated>	0
" one of the guns used at columbine was a tec - 9 , a semiautomatic handgun once specifically advertised by its manufacturer as the most popular crime weapon in america . the tec - 9 was banned under president clinton ' s semiautomatic weapon order some years ago and is no longer made , but the ones that are still out there can be legally sold .

i used to think the answer to this was bin laden , but after reading an article called ' the brain ' ( playboy ' s june issue ) , i switched my opinion to khalid shieikh mohammed . does anyone else agree with me ? this guy was the mastermind behind so many terrorist attacks ( incl . 9 / 11 ) that it made my head spin . it was also surprising to read that he received his bachelor ' s degree here in the states , with classmates describing him as a ' class clown ' . simply crazy , and scary when you think about it . thoughts or opinions ? steve what about god ? so many god - fearing people , he must be a terrorist <happy> seriously i really do not know much about terrorists . i know that bin laden was behind 9 / 11 but he wasn ' t the only one , but that ' s about it .	1

hey speaking of clueless , what would you call the rather significant increase in the percentage of wealth for the top 5% over the last couple decades ? how about redistribution of wealth . how about trickle down economics ? you realize in order for that to have a chance to work you have to keep the incentives for the rich to invest that money domestically . otherwise they get the breaks and then ship that extra wealth offshore where it stays because there is no incentive to bring it back . thems good numbers making folk using them things they teach in them fancy city colleges . if you could see past last week and next week you might understand the slow erosion of the things that are in place to make some of these ideas work . you kidding ? ez can not see past the front of his cobwebbed skull .	1
as theorized , the concept of evolution is analogous to slow morphing , rather than quick abrupt changes in a species . <allcaps> morphing </allcaps> ! , as can be done with computer graphics programs designed by intelligent beings . evolution implies species go through a process of advantagous and purposful change - - but morphing is accomplished by unintelligent random processes , or at least that ' s how the story goes - - the created universe and life were random events . i have been patiently waiting for many years but to date have never seen or heard of any species morphing into another species . i am aware of genetic defects that limit species but unaware of mutations that perpetuate new species . clearly variation within species is possible and has been observed , such as poodles and great danes , but they remain members of the same species . mankind has thousands of years of written history and i am unaware of anyone observing species morphation ( is that a word ? ) . although it is approaching 200 years after darwin hypothesised how species might have originated , we are no closer to observing a species morphing than darwin . humans attempt to create new species , such as breeding donkey with horses to get mules and lions with tigers to get ligers , but these " <allcaps> new </allcaps> " species are almost always born sterile and unable to perpetuate themselves . besides observing it , the way to demonstrate evolution is to manipulate a species until it developes into a new species , but alas , then all you will have proven is directed efforts of intelligent beings create species . hmm , wonder what intelligent being ( s ) created us ? i would suggest you look at the faero island mouse then . that is a new species , and it is not man doing it , but rather nature itself .	0

funny how the truth so often tends to have an anti - christian bias . if you can find something untrue in the article , point it out and proffer your evidence ; otherwise . <repeated> i did not think posters were required to " balance " their opinions here . at least now we see what passes for " moderation " on this board . ( that ' s right , folks : you can not put <allcaps> jps </allcaps> on your ignore lists , ' cuz he ' s a " moderator .

if they turn to god he will make their way and grant their heart ' s desires . ever been to eastern ky ? many of the residents share a very strong faith in the christian religion . they also share abject poverty , malnutrition and starvation , substandard or absent medical care , contaminated water supplies , and dangerous and often poorly heated / ventilated " housing " . yes easy , truly their cups overfloweth .	0

" baldwin says his research not only ' confirms that homosexuals molest children at a rate vastly higher than heterosexuals , ' but it found that ' the mainstream homosexual culture ' even ' commonly promotes sex with children .

there are no criminal penalties for private individuals and organizations violating the constitutional rights of other private individuals . your backpack and person may be searched without a warrant if they have reason to suspect you of having stolen something . as there are no penalties that means there is no crime having been committed . the civil rights act of 1964 is another matter of discussion entirely . unfortunately until lower court cases build precedent to show that firearms ownership is a civil right and will be treated as such there is nothing that can be done when private individuals choose to prohibit firearms on said property . a cop tried that in school and got sued and lost , a private individual will get sued for assault , and false imprisonment at the least . there are more cases each day but one thing the justices did mention was marbury v madison . you can ignore an illegal law with impunity . we have the ruling . we also have past cases quoted in the h eller and mcdonald cases . you implied there were none and that is false . would you like to take a stab at nunn v , state of georgia for instance ? star gazer cited a lower court ruling that the gun grabbers used just as sinjin used an earlier , oveturned case in people v zirillo . how can you miss so much ?	0
i can understand your point that , in the absolute , metaphysical sense , we can never be 100.00% sure of any of our knowledge . just because all humans always have experienced the existence of the world , does not mean that it is 100.00% certain , just that the probability that it is true approaches 100.00% ( say , 99.9999999% ) . the greater the amount of evidence , the closer that certainty is to 100.00% . that 0.0000001% leaves room for obsurd scenarios - such as that an omnicient being is causing us all to merely imagine our reality , or the scenario of the movie " the matrix " . these can be fun to ponder ( especially in a social situation after a few drinks <wink> ) , but no one takes them seriously . if anyone did seriously live by the idea that the world may not exist , they would quickly do something stupid and die , or change their minds . no - one experiences the existence of an outside world . explanations such as the matrix can explain sense impressions as well as some concept of ' external reality ' . we have no more evidence for one than the other . the fact no - one takes them seriously is a psychological point about human beings , nothing to do with reality per se .	0
we do have the models of conduct of pan asian families , however , and their success stories . obviously , these folks have been quick to grasp the rules of capitalism . they have also been quick to adapt to urban cultures . could it be a cultural gap ? a native belief system that does not translate well into western concepts of capitalism ? it is to be noted that islam translates with difficulty into capitalism because of their rules regarding charging interest on loaning money . poverty may seem insurmountable today , but would not water - born disease have seemed that way a century ago ? yet we are not many years away from everyone in the world having access to clean water and sanitation .	0
this is another problem with humanism , because there is no moral authority to stop people from doing whatever they want to do , hence the adage that humanism is a philosophy that has both feet planted firmly in mid - air the human collective is the authority . one major advantage of this authority over a theistic one is that it actually exists .	0

1 ) can you prove what you claimed earlier ? you claimed that what i was saying was ' wrong ' , and then you proceeded to say that proving it was ' too much ' . <repeated> should not you have to prove that claim as much as what i have said ? 2 ) unlike you , i have been very upfront about the situation . at the start , i asked if anybody knew of a state that had removed interracial marriage laws without court involvement . since then , you have done your worst to obfuscate the issue . 3 ) what claim are you asking for proof on ? please tell me that you are not asking for proof on the item in <hashtag> 2 </hashtag> , cause we have both mutually stated something about the difficulty of proving it . if it ' s <hashtag> 2 </hashtag> , then your request would be mundane and mindless . emoticonxfrazzled so you have no idea if any states removed interracial marriage laws without court involvement ? and i will just answer your question then which was ( as you restated ) [ does ] anybody kn [ o ] w of a state that had removed interracial marriage laws without court involvement . that answer is , yes , i know of a state that hard removed interracial marriage laws without court involvement . glad i could help .	0
you know what i find amusing here . <repeated> your entire argument revolves around how it will affect your wallet . forget about the lives of the people who are denied rights in this country that you take forgranted . that is the true christian - american spirit is not it ? oh how proud our forefathers would be if they could see us now . <repeated> oh wait . <repeated> most of them owned people . <repeated> nevermind . and an even funnier thing is it will not affect his wallet at all .	0

quite so . i am having great difficulty understanding why you think your opinion should be made law in the universe ? have you ever for a moment stopped to think that perhaps you could be wrong ? of course i know that i could be wrong but i would have to be proven wrong through rational arguement , not just claims . have you ever stopped to think that perhaps you could be wrong ? either way , we already discussed this issue of whether people can have opinions about abortion law . perhaps you are having a ' senior moment ' and do not remember our discussion . i really do not feel like repeating this whole discussion all over again for your benefit . indeed , you do seem to repeat your questions quite often . if you do not like someone ' s answer , do not just repeat the question - address their answer . if you do not remember our discussion , it started pretty much around post <hashtag> 861 </hashtag> . unless you have something new to say that we did not already discuss , then i think we pretty much covered it and left it at a disagreement .	0

what i am saying is that there are people on mars , but they have not been yet discovered . there are cities and towns , there are seas and rivers , there are mountains and plains . mars is different from our moon , and different from either of venus and mercury . moon has no water , no atmosphere and no life thereon . <url> venus has stopped its axial rotation , and has undergone many serious changes concerning its atmosphere which became some thick smoke and mixture of gases , in addition to the increase in the temperature of the day - side that is continuously facing the sun , and the extreme coldness and freezing of the other night - side ; this has led to the extermination of life upon venus . <url> mercury had stopped its axial rotation , a long time before venus , and such serious changes in its atmosphere and the temperature extremity occurred before those on venus . then mercury lost most of its atmosphere , because of the weakness of its gravity ; then mercury had been exposed to the falling of large numbers of comets upon it . and all such circumstances had led to the extermination of life upon mercury . <url> <url> but the case is different for mars : its atmosphere is clear , it includes the cloud drifted by the wind , there is the alternation of the night and day , and seasons , and the polar regions of mars include water in the form of ice . moreover , the high mountains include ice on their tops . and not all the planet is covered by ice . and certainly they have made many mistakes and have not yet discovered the life on mars , which is expected to be known in the near future . <url> eanassir <url> if they have not been discovered yet , <allcaps> how the bloody hell do you know </allcaps> ? ten percent more brains and you ' d be pondlife . emoticonxkill	1

why are there so many people that express interest in who i love ? ( a rhetorical question ) why are there so many people that express interest in how i love ? ( also a rhetorical question ) with all of the atrocities in this country and the world , it seems so odd that politicians and those of ' religion , ' as well as the public in general , are so interested in our personal lives . why can not the politicians and those of ' religion ' and the public in general place their interest in the atrocities ? and to negate an expected reply , who i love and how i love is not an atrocity in any way . see there is such a thing as heterosexual privledge . some heterosexuals will do anything , or say anything to protect this privledge . for the christianist it is all about control , and money . the christianist will say anything or do anything to maintian their money and control . take own own archangel , for example , in everyone of his posts he extols his religious beliefs and his belief that everyone should be both hetero and his brand of christian . one must ask themselves ; why does he peach against something that does not personally effect his life ? i have come to the conclusion that he is afraid that he will loose his heterosexual privledge and his control as a christian .	0
as much as i ' d love pacifism and peace and tolerance and all that wonderful stuff , and i do believe , as my signature says , that violence is the last refuge of the incompetent , it can not be helped so long as we live in a world where people think they need violence . i say take a few pacifistic earthlings , resettle them on other planets , and build nice and peaceful spacer worlds away from the violence and squalor of this planet . <happy> and as their populations grew over thousands of years , civilizations seperate out and independent nations form , laws are set up , and some prosper while others wallow in poverty , how long do you think it will take until people begin to kill each other on your peaceful planets ? nice dream , but real life does not work like that .	0

<allcaps> schumer </allcaps> : ok . now , let me ask you this . when you wrote that statement , you did not - - as we discussed yesterday - - when you wrote that the constitution does not protect the right to an abortion , you had no exceptions . so that would mean , at least in 1985 , your view then , there would be no constitutional protection for a woman to terminate her pregnancy even if the termination was needed to preserve her future ability to have children , right ? <allcaps> alito </allcaps> : senator , it was a general statement that did not go into - - it did not . <repeated> <allcaps> schumer </allcaps> : but it had no exceptions . you did not make that . <repeated> <allcaps> alito </allcaps> : it was one sentence , and it certainly did not represent . <repeated> <allcaps> schumer </allcaps> : there was no - - you did not write any exception for that situation . correct ? it just said the constitution does not protect . it was without exception . and , yesterday , you did not argue me when i mentioned that without exception . <allcaps> alito </allcaps> : i do not recall your using the words without exception . <allcaps> schumer </allcaps> : i think i did . ( <allcaps> crosstalk </allcaps> ) <allcaps> schumer </allcaps> : if you believe . <repeated> <allcaps> alito </allcaps> : could i just answer that question ? it ' s one sentence and it certainly is not an attempt to set out a comprehensive view of the subject . <allcaps> schumer </allcaps> : no , i understand that . but it was a very strong statement . it did not talk about any exceptions at all . and the way i read that statement , even if a woman was raped by her father , she ' d have no constitutional protection to have an abortion and terminate that pregnancy . if you believe the constitution protects no right to an abortion that would follow , would not it ? <allcaps> alito </allcaps> : i think the statement speaks for itself , and it ' s one sentence and it ' s not an effort to set out a comprehensive view of . <repeated> <allcaps> schumer </allcaps> : knowing these examples , do you still refuse to distance yourself in any way from a broad , unqualified statement , without exception , that the constitution does not protect the right to an abortion ? no ands , ifs or buts , is my words . <allcaps> alito </allcaps> : what i actually said was that i was proud of my participation in the thornburg case in which the government made the argument that it made in the thornburg case . <repeated> <allcaps> schumer </allcaps> : but you said in the previous sentence to that statement that you personally held those views . <allcaps> alito </allcaps> : that ' s correct . but what i was talking about there was the thornburg case and nothing more than the thornburg case . <allcaps> schumer </allcaps> : i understand . but you have not rethought the position at all , even knowing these extreme cases and the hardship that it might cause ? <allcaps> alito </allcaps> : well , what you have pointed out is exactly why , if the issue were to come up , and one were to get beyond stare decisis , the whole judicial decision - making process would have to be gone through . <allcaps> schumer </allcaps> : you did not think that through in 1985 ? <allcaps> alito </allcaps> : i was not involved in . <repeated> <allcaps> schumer </allcaps> : when you wrote the statement . when you wrote that statement . <allcaps> alito </allcaps> : and when i wrote the statement what i was saying was that i was proud of what i had done in relation to the thornburg case , which was to write the memo that the committee is aware of , which did not argue that roe should be overruled , did not argue that the government should argue that roe should be overruled , but that the decision should be challenged on other grounds that were quite similar . <allcaps> schumer </allcaps> : i understand what you wrote , but you also - - we can bring the statement up here , but i do not want to go over the thing of yesterday . i would just ask you to think of all the consequences of a broad statement , even from 1985 , that the constitution does not protect the right to abortions . not an exception of health of the mother , not an exception of rape or incest , not an exception of any of these others . i did not see any of those in your job application . but i want to conclude on . <repeated> <allcaps> alito </allcaps> : senator . <repeated> <allcaps> schumer </allcaps> : go ahead , please . <allcaps> alito </allcaps> : it was one sentence . and i think what you are saying highlights the importance of not addressing this until the judicial process takes place where all of this complexity would be taken into account . <allcaps> schumer </allcaps> : in all due respect , sir , i think it highlights the importance of an obligation to discuss it , particularly in light of a strong statement before . but we will have to differ on that . schumer is a bonafide idiot , as are many in the senate . he failingly tried to draw alito into exposing how he would rule on abortion if presented a case . alito is far too intelligent to be logically trapped by a buffoon such as shumer . it is also plain to see he interrupts when he supposes the response will indeed make sense against his flailings .	0

maybe massachusetts should allow for divorces via notarized mail by non - residents or whatever else is needed to make it easier to do so remotely and more timely , if someone has a serious need to get a legal divorce for such a marriage that only exists somewhere else . why do not we do the same for straight marriages then ? why does not a straight couple that gets married in colorado , and then moves to virginia , have to get their divorce " remotely " from virginia . or maybe you should start thinking about what <allcaps> authority </allcaps> colorado has to grant a divorce to virginian <allcaps> residents </allcaps> .	0

how have things improved in saudi arabia ? ahem ! north korea has only had one change of leadership . therefore internally it is stable . as to causing external instability - true it does do that , but then so does the usa . causing external instability is what makes both nations evil . as compared to how they would be during a period of instability ? i said they were internally stable so we agree here , ahem . also the us is not unstable as far as external physical forces are to us . economic forces you could make a point but not the extent that everyone is declaring sanctions against us . that is what north korea is basically doing only it is a physical force that is building against them . the us has no external threat against them at this time that is as threatening as what north korea is facing and that is because the us is far more externally stable than north korea is . i am not surprised that you declare the us evil for causing instability but give it no credit for creating this stability that we have been focused on .	0

every system has its flaws . does that mean that we should abolish every system ? no , we should not abolish every flawed system . however , when the flaw results in putting innocent people to death , it is not worth the risk . in 26 years the death penalty has been in effect in my home state of illinois , there have been more people exonerated due to irrefutable evidence than have been put to death . i think that constitutes a serious problem .	0

why do people on the pro - gun side continuously try to oversimplify the issue ? no one is really arguing that there would be zero murder without guns . the question is would there be less murders without guns . in developed nations with stricter gun laws there are less murders . at any rate , i do not think you can draw such conclusions based on one incident . a slimey claim you cannot support as usual . in developed nations , the u.s. is far down the list as has been posted on this very board at least 5 times . those ' other ' nations also have far more crime and violent crime than the u.s.	0
modern - day citizens are far more likely to be aware of the sheer range of religious views in human cultures , past and present , and the consequent improbability that just one of them ( and hey , waddaya know ? it ' s mine ! ) is wholly true and all the others wholly false . this leads some into woolly new - age - ist pick - and - mixing ; others to conclude that the world ' s religions are all the product of a similar , purely mundane , process of cultural evolution , and that none actually reflects fundamental truths . these are not the only two options available . the many philosophical views of the material world or ethics do not mean these two things do not exist .	0
but of course , if it happens after president obama has his people installed , people who believe in science and research and reality , and these reality - oriented people have taken full control of the agencies who oversee these sorts of things and have made sure that regular inspections are made for food safety . i think you ' d better at least allow the man six months to get his people and policies in place . oh yes , president obama also has to figure out how to get rid of the bush policy of lies and falseness bush people burrowed into the federal government by bush during his last days as president in order to thwart the spread of science , research and reality .	0
it apparently is one person . it could be an atheist . i suspect it is an ex - baptist . <repeated> but it also could be another religious minority whose religion was targeted . i think ex - baptist is most likely . if i recall correctly , many of the fires were started at about the same time , so more than one person seems likely . and were not they mostly black churches that have been targeted ? i would not discount racism as the motive .	0
yeah , i agree with everyone else who has seen the new batmans . they both literally blew my mind . that is what a comic book adaption is supposed to be , not that silly bs from the old movies . here ' s the order . 1 . new batman movies 2 . x - men 3 . ironman 4 . the first spiderman movie only ! <repeated> 5 . superman and honestly , i debate whether to even include superman . below the 5 th listed all the superhero movies are dead to me . screw them . and after the first spiderman movie they turned into cheesy suck fests . i watched that scene with the stupid cart on that wire . ugh , i swore to never watch another spiderman movie again , did not even see the end . absolutely terrible . okay , i guess i will have to watch the new batman movies soon . what did you think of the opening scene to x2 ? with nightcrawler trying to assassinate the president ? one of my favorite scenes from any movie . yeah , each spider - man movie was worse . last i heard , they are planning a complete reboot without tobey or raimi .	0
lumped in with everyone else in these ' exchanges ' . in any event , anything is more expensive than nothing . but are not the exchanges primarily aimed at those who can not get insurance otherwise ? i would have thought that if insurance was so little used by young people , insurers would be keen to get their business , and premiums would be low . maybe insurance is more necessary for young people than you think ?	0

it is only because we eat too much meat and i had said that before . the point about needing animal protien wasn ' t that we are not getting enough , but that we do need some of it in our diet to be fully healthy . well that is good that you recognize our society eats too much meat and too much protein . now will you agree with me that you can get all the protein you need from whole wheat bread , oatmeal , beans , corn , peas , mushrooms , and broccoli ? now granted some vegetarians eat alot of junk food , and in that case they are <allcaps> not </allcaps> getting the right amount of protein . but many vegans like myself dont eat <allcaps> any </allcaps> junk food and follow the recommended food pyramid for vegans . i follow it very strictly and i know beyond any doubt that i am more healthy than the vast majority of americans out there .	0

but you are for abortion in certain cases right ? i am only talking to the pro abortionists . if you believe abortion should be allowed you are technically for it . if you are pro choice that implies that you are for the allowance of abortions . if it means this much to you i will change the debate title . i am pro - choice because when i get pregnant , i want to chose whether or not i will abort it . i am not pro - abortion because i do not want to be forced to aborting my child when i get pregnant i am not pro - life , because i do not want to be forced to have my child when i get pregnant . i am pro - choice , do not call me pro - abortion , because that is not what i am . i do not go on the streets and say ' ' hey , let us all have abortions ' ' you on the other hand go on and say ' ' hey let us give all fetuses life ' ' that ' s what makes you pro - life . i do not want abortion . i wish no one would chose it because it would be much better without it . but the world is not ideal . do not change the title , i just want people to know that we are called pro - choicers .	0

in the quote which you referenced , the bottom line was " the point at which we assign rights is a matter of opinion .

there is nothing wrong with honest intelligent debate on this issue , but the anti - gun crowd do not bring honest intelligent arguments to the table . the only thing they bring is fear and emotion driven rhetoric without any factual basis . for example , just mention the low murder rates in canada and switzerland , where gun ownership is legal , and they scatter like cockroaches . and you are baffled that you do not have more intelligent debate with people . i am shocked .	1

you flaming liberals are really something else . at least we are generous with our own money . you radicals help the poor using other people ' s money . then you keep them on your government plantation so they can vote to keep you in power . sieg heil ! <repeated> you kind of made a good point here . <repeated> both the government and the church have ulterrior motives for ' helping the poor ' : the politicians hope to gain votes and the church hopes to gain converts . <repeated> both groups of suckers will be paying back for the rest of their lives in one way or another . and the church collects more of ' it ' s own money ' to purchase more poor sinners . both groups are indentured servants to their masters . what do you mean ' generous with your own money ' ? is not that what the government is ? perhaps the christians do not want to help all the poor - only those who belong to their church or those willing to sell their souls to it . both are doing a terrible job of ' helping the poor ' .	1

why do not you try to make george walker bush feel a little guilt and trauma for destroying the nation of iraq , for murdering tens of thousands of innocent women and children , for causing the deaths of nearly 3,000 young americans who left behind mourning mothers , fathers , wives , husbands , in some cases many children who will be left to the mercy of our nation ' s horrible economy and will probably live in poverty for the rest of their lives . probably because this is an abortion forum and not a forum about the iraq war . <repeated> not only that , there is no parallel .	1
no , you lose . you lose any respect as someone who has an iota of common sense and decency as an american . he was under attack because he had invaded kuwait and we were in the process of throwing him out of kuwait . there was no justification to be firing scuds at innocent israelis who were not a part of that war . you do not have a clue ; not a single clue about saddam . you just parrot the typical left - wing crapola . and it ' s doubly sickening coming from an american . again he was under attack . listen to yourself . and talk about a parrot ? no one is arguing saddam was a saint . but he wasn ' t and threat and he wasn ' t insane enough to commit sucide . you are too busy being a lemming and being led over the cliff with president shrub ( molly irvins - - gw is to small to be a bush ) . <wink>	1
saving lives is a republican goal ? then , why have the republicans condemned us to this ugly , nonproductive war in iraq ? the terrorists continue to terrorize us because we have deterred our efforts against them to iraq , ( and bush intends to widen this nonproductive war into iran and syria ) where nearly 700,000 iraqis have been needlessly slaughtered , where more than 3,000 of our young have been sacrified in vain , and you have the audacity to say that " saving lives is a republican goal . " meanwhile we burn saudi arabian oil and by so doing , fuel the funding of countless schools of hate against the united states throughout the world . osama bin laden , the prime terrorist in the world , issued out of saudi arabia . he was funded by saudi arabia . most of the terrorists on those planes that attacked my nation on september 11, 2001 , were from saudi arabia . iraq had nothing to do with that attack . iran had nothing to do with that attack . syria had nothing to do with that attack . ever had an attack of reality , gman ? simone , read the sentence again please . it was " saving lives is " not just " a republican goal . " it concerns the subject of abortion . the only way it relates to the politics of iraq , is that abortionist would rather kill our kids before they get to " volunteer " their services for iraq . i can not let one statement you made go though . terrorist continue to terrorize us ? where have they attacked in the u.s. since 9 - 11 ? consider continuing this in an appropriate thread .	1

so why , in this gun - hater ' s dream come true of congress , did they choose not to advance a single gun control bill and have it signed into law ? i do not find it surprising . it ' s probably a strategic sacrifice on their part rather than a change in their personal views . they do not want to lose votes and possible support from gun owners for their priorities like health care reform because of a difference of opinion on gun control policy . they know that the republicans are going to hit them with everything they have got during election time and exaggerated accusations about the democrats wanting to take away people ' s guns would hurt them . the republicans learned during the clinton years that creating as much as paranoia as possible about the democrats supporting big government is the way to regain a majority in congress . it ' s all politics .	0

it does not do this , because proponents of natural selection rule out ' ends ' . <repeated> other than survival , and survival simply come about because organisms survive ( hence the tautology of " survival of the fittest " which darwin himself felt was a superior phrase to " natural selection " ) . as was pointed out in some of your own quotations , survival is not an ' end ' of natural selection . natural selection is the differential reproductive success of organisms with more favorable suites of characteristics . it is a statistical tendency . individual organisms may work to survive , but they also work to reproduce . that ' s as close as it gets to " purpose . " and as you know , darwin ' s favored term was natural selection . he never used the phrase " survival of the fittest " without also making a reference to natural selection . the opposite is not the case . since darwin ' s time " survival of the fittest " has been rejected by evolutionary biologists because it is such a poor representation of the extent of the theory .	0

the interesting thing about the ' quality of life ethic ' is that , in a pro - choice framework , it means that we can not degrade anyone ' s quality of life without their permission . so far from entailing a cull of the elderly , the infirm , the handicapped , and the ugly , the quality of life ethic entails that we cannot kill them off . each person is entitled to the quality of life that they desire where what they desire does not infringe on other ' s quality of life . tell this to those infants and adults in the netherlands who are being euthanized against their will . this is a logical conclusion of a quality of life ethic without a sanctity of life basis .	0

i think you may be taking our objections a bit too seriously . what he said was stupid and homophobic , sure . but i have no idea who this guy is or how big an audience , if any , he has . if i thought he had the country ' s ear , if he was running for office , if he set policy ; then i ' d be concerned . as it is , i am quite content to just point out what an idiot he seems to be . and i am curious . you do not actually think that anyone who supports gay rights in any way could find that piece anything but disrespectful , do you ? granted , he may not be worth worrying about , but he clearly has no respect for gays at all . what do you find disrespectful about it ? maybe it is ' disrespectful ' but i sometimes that ' s not necessarily so bad . i do not think it rises to the level of being offensive .	0

yes , jp is using his usual tactic of bait and switch , starting out with a claim , and then replacing it with something that he thinks we will not notice is different . as foundit also pointed out , his statistics show " same - sex " households , which can mean roommates , etc . as well as gay couples , so it is likely that the actual income might be lower for homosexuals . speaking from ignorance once again , eh sp ? did you , by chance , ever read the 2000 census form ? did you happen to see the category " unmarried partner " ? i did not think so . now , go eat some crow . emoticonxhoho <url>	1

you do not seem to want a written constitution either , or at least one that is not as vauge as ours . i have gathered from your posts that you want a direct democracy , where everyone gets to vote on each others rights . you want the people to be able vote on such issues as abortion , and marriage , you want a tryanny of the majority . any one who wants people to be able to vote upon the civil rights of another is an enemy of freedom . i do like written constitutions very much ; and our constitution is not vague at all . in the first amendment , the question is not whether congress may make a law , but rather what is ' the freedom of the press ? ' this phrase has objective , historic meaning , and obscenity is not covered within that objective , historic meaning . neither , by the way , is the publishing of nuclear secrets . you have gathered incorrectly , for i do not want a direct democracy . how do you suppose we got ' civil rights ' recognized in the constitution to begin with , matthew ? did the words just magically appear there , or did a vast majority of people vote to put them there ? oh yes , that ' s right , a vast majority of people voted to put them there . darn evil democracy ! i say down with majority rule !	1

<url> actually have not read all of this article yet , but it looks interesting . i think i posted that awhile ago . its huge bs . thats like saying " civil rights hurt blacks " . even though abortion may have some unwated side affects , its no where near the emotional and physical pain and suffering for the rest of your life than a forced pregnancy . just goes to show that the pro - life movement is desperate .	0
on this 3 5 th anniversary of the roe v . wade decision , i would like to share my views on the issue of abortion . life begins at the point of conception . no one can deny that after a human being is conceived it will develop into the very same being as those debating this issue . what astounds me is that those who favor abortion went through an identical development stage as the being they are condemning to death . would these very same people agree that a similiar choice should have been made about their own existence ? abortion today is used primarily as a birth control of convenience because people are too self - centered to take precautions . they prefer their own pleasurable self - indulgence over the care and sanctity of the life they created . what ever happened to taking responsibility for one ' s actions in this country ? is it too much to ask a woman who has conceived to place the child into adoption ? nine months of discomfort is nothing compared to life in prison for voluntary manslaughter ! does the father of the child have a say in this ? and what about the constitution of the united states ? are not all people conceived in this country deserving of life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness ? i believe abortion is a crime against humanity and should be outlawed . we need to overturn the roe v . wade decision and get back to cherishing life in this country . for a country that murders it ' s children cannot be far from self destruction . you have some good points here , but what do you do in the event of pregnancy due to rape ? or a pregnancy that is going to put the life of the mother at risk ? and to push the line a bit further , what about failed contraception , where the ' morning after ' pill is taken ? does that count as abortion as it happens after conception ? smiley	0

we simply do not evolve , there is no scientific proof just ideas which change from day to day that also explain our siciety today . but there is evidence that we do evolve . i will give you an example . in areas of west africa where malaria is endemic there is an allele of hemoglobin that confers resistance when heterozygous . in other environments that allele is not beneficial and is , in fact , deleterious . it is fatal when homozygous . now according to evolutionary theory such an allele should decline where it offers no benefit . studies show that this allele is less frequent by about 2 percentage points in americans of west african ancestry .	0

there are a few fictional works which addressed this possibility and brought up interesting points . one is aldous huxley ' s book brave new world . in it , people were grown in artificial wombs , not born , and they could be genetically designed . in the book , a high level official of this society mentions to the main character that an experiment had been tried in which all the people made were brilliant , athletic and beautiful - anyway , characteristics that we admire in people ( nothing was said about picking their moral character ) . they ended up killing each other in competition for the better jobs and for leadership since nobody was willing to play the subservient menial role . therefore , this society purposely grew humans who were at different levels ( some very mentally deficient ) to supply a distributions of people who could fit the distribution of roles necessary for society . therefore , on an individual level , i do not have much of a problem with genetic engineering ( assuming that we really fully knew what we are doing , which is doubtful since many unforseen side effects could occur ) . however , on a societal level , it could be very problematic . well , i did not really mean to go that far . but i am talking about problems like that all worked out , thought about previously , and that the problem was worked out . i am talking more about , what if you could make laborers stronger , scientists smarter , and rid us of physical and mental abnormalities ( such as down syndrome , narcolepsy , etc . ) . i do not think of making everyone the same for that reason . i am just saying , what if there was a way to better society without going overboard ? if the problems were worked out , which i am sure they will be , what would your moral view on it be ?	0

civil rights have nothing to do with the religion . if they were based on what the bible allowed , women would only be looked at as child - bearing , housekeeping , subservient wives . slavery would be allowed and girls would get married after having their first period . it ' s one thing to live in accordance with your beliefs , it ' s something entirely different to make others live by your rules . do you have any new testament passages to back these up - or were you just interested in having a rant ?	1
i think a better question is what preserved their life for so long ? it is the mercy of god that upholds and preserves people in this life . it is the sin of human beings that is responsible for death . this is not correct . god does go ' out of his way ' to keep everyone alive . besides that , god would never be presented with any kind of problem , much less a problem of overpopulation . good grief , to suggest that the god who created the earth would have a problem with overpoulation is , frankly , as ridiculous as trying to find some passage in the bible that condones , allows , or supports any and every abortion that occurs . that is ridiculous . ok , i understand now . all those people , including children and the fetuses of pregnant women were all sinful and god had to murder them in tsunamis , earthquakes , etc . , is that how god deals with overpopulation ? i guess that wars are part of god ' s plan , too , because the recent invasion of iraq wiped out more than 100,000 iraqis according to god ' s plan for dealing with overpopulation .	1

i agree . time will tell if the cells are as effective as embryonic stem cells , and it seems on the surface , they well might be . except . these stem must be donated by pregnant women . amniocentesis , while pretty darn safe , is not without risk . first , the pregnant mother must donate the cells . the risk to the fetus is not zero . when we already have a zero risk procedure from cells that are going to be disposed of anyway . in any event , i am sure some nut job with an extremely skewed sense of morality will find a way to call this procedure immoral in some way . yeah , it does have risk unlike the embryonic stem cells , but i think that if it comes out the way they hope , it will eventually lead to more embryonic uses as well when people realize that this can have risks . i think it is good to have this way as a back up while people argue over the use of cells that would otherwise be disposed , and get some treatment to people who need it rather than letting it be denied to them by anti - abortionists . and yeah , it ' s pretty much guaranteed that someone will find something to object about , claiming it is immoral ( maybe it will now be that these stem cells are potential human life and we can not use them emoticonxrolleyes ) , but it will likely not have as many objections .	0

sympathetic jurors do not make decisions based on facts . there is no need for you all ( you all ) to feel as i do . god forbid we should all think alike . i am just getting feedback . <repeated> seeing who really has balls and who does not , among other things . i trust all my peers to be human . considering the bell shaped curve of possible reactions to various stimuli , that ' s not saying much . regarding the mental illness , why do not we just lock up mentally ill murderers for the rest of their lives ? . <repeated> no release for any reason whatsoever including some future psychiatric evaluation that claims the murderer is now ready to go back into society ? i love when differing from someones opinion is ' weak ' . such a convincing argument .	1
so thats quite contradictory to me . <repeated> you would allow a law that kills <elongated> millions of innocent babies a year and get rid of a law that rightly carries out the law . <repeated> wierd sounds like a liberal to me . you mean to tell me that you would deny a woman ' s right to her own body for a zygote , yet you have no problem murdering real human beings ? sounds like a conservative to me . <repeated>	1
that ' s not cannibalism . if it were cannibalism jesus would not have walked away from the meal . or did that cross your mind ? the catholic church wasn ' t the first church , unless you can show me that in the book of acts , or the gospels . it ' s not what they claim , but what we see in history . i imagine a great many catholics will get to heaven before you will . once again - and get this through your noggin - i base my beliefs on what ' s in the gospels and the new testament . john 3:36 of course it crossed my mind , but logic is not allowed ; this is religion . jesus is not showing up or walking away from their bread munching wine drinking rituals . i am supposed to be surprised that jesus supposedly said just one more thing which makes no sense what so ever ? the early church wasn ' t called catholic because there were no other protestants running around to differentiate between . if imagination alone could generate heaven , you would be right . i have no reason to believe heaven exists . which are based on the beliefs of the early church , which you have already admitted existed during jesus ' s life time .	1
uh , there is love minus sex , and sex minus love . what are you calling it ? are you simply jealous because you lack writing skills and no one has considered you for anything outside of menial labor ? <allcaps> lol </allcaps> . are you jealous because they will not let you out of the institution while gansao get ' s to run all over the place ?	1
how many men who are single fathers and take sole responiblity for thier children because the women refuses to do so will you find if you go looking ? a few yes , but how many more women will you find in the reverse prediciment ? i know of at least 3 personally , including my brother . he fought for custody for years and it nearly bankrupted him . he was trying to get his kids away from an ex - wife that would go away with her boyfriend for weekends at a time and leave their 15 year old daughter in charge of three <elongated> younger siblings .	0
why would you sell your genetic advantage to other people ? you would become a lot less valuable commodity . you would not be a commodity at all if you were not willing to sell , you will be hunted though . i guess you could rent out your labor for a time if you somehow did not get hunted and were not willing to sell your genetic material .	0

more concrete than the thought processes which dismiss out of hand the flat statement of the us secretary of state opining that no functioning democracy should allow private ownership of guns , but allow them only to be lawfully held by the state ? sleep well . no kidding . what could <allcaps> possibly </allcaps> be more concrete ? as far as i can tell , she has never publicly made a statement specifically about the dc gun ban but since , as you pointed out , she <allcaps> did </allcaps> say that no functioning democracy should allow private ownership of guns , i have trouble believing that she thinks the private citizens of dc should be allowed to own guns , <allcaps> unless </allcaps> what she is saying is that since we own guns , we should move toward a monarchy or perhapse some kind of dictatorship . she did not , as far as i know , voice her opinion regarding private gun ownership in a totalitarian system .	0
you cannot mandate biology . the fact of the matter is , however , that homosexual relationships , themselves , appear to have no positive evolutionary purpose . without effects on the female line , this aberration ( for lack of a better word ) would have bred itself out of the population long ago . it would be similar to a subset of the population in an animal species suddenly being attracted to another , separate animal species . it would seem to serve no positive purpose . procreation is a positive , useful purpose to any activity in an evolutionary context . sexual attraction exists to facilitate procreation . pleasure during sex exists to facilitate procreation . homosexual individuals have brains that co - opt specific biological functions to substitute creatures that do not facilitate the purpose they evolved to involve . humans do not just have sex for procreation . humans have sex for pleasure . that explains the evolution of the clitoris and the bundle of nerves underneath the head of the penis .	0

a very good friend of mine has a masters in theology from an accredited institution . she is also hosting my wedding to my partner in the fall . she is a christian but she doen ' t share your beliefs . your partner would not happen to be a guy , would he ? as for your christian friend , ask her to join the fray . i ' d like to ask her a few questions , such as : who do you say jesus christ is ? if not lord , god , savior , and jewish messiah then she is on the wrong page . ask her if people need jesus christ for redemption for their sins ? ask her if people should repent of their sins and turn from them ? ask her who the holy spirit is ? if not god , then she ' s on the wrong page ( note acts 5 ) . ask her if the bible does not say gay sex is a sin ( leviticus 18:22 , lev . 20:13 , romans 1:26 - 27 ; i corinthians 6 : 9 - 10 ; jude 7 , etc . ) ? those will do for starters .	0

regarding the exodus passage : why should men fighting each other , hitting a pregnant woman , and thereby causing her to miscarry or give birth prematurely ( take your pick on which is the better translation ) be considered " abortion " in the first place ? it seems to me the position of the woman is rather different in the two scenarios ! i am not saying abortion is always morally acceptable , not by a longshot . but i am also not saying it never is , either . it is not offered to make that assertion at all . it is offered to show that god values the life of the unborn if he will demand that a man responsible for causing its death in the womb be held accountable by paying the ultimate price .	0
this is a push to promote lawlessness . the san francisco fiasco is the prime example . people with certain agendas are refusing to follow the laws . this is a devastating precedent for our nation . first of all , it ' s not a precedent . this is the seventh or eighth state where a higher court has found anti - gay discrimination in marriage unconstitutional . secondly , when so many rulings go in this direction , it can hardly be called " lawlessness " . it ' s a call for lawful , constitutional interpretation of statutes . it takes extraordinary intellectual dishonesty to pretend there is some " agenda " at work . these decisions are the consequence of two things : our long history of rationally applying those silly words about equality that folks smarter than this generation of politicians put in the constitution <allcaps> and </allcaps> a long - term correction of the misunderstandings of what homosexuality is and what its consequences are . i know you do not personally believe it , but there is nothing wrong with us .	0
you said in one post you are a ex - christian . if you new anything of christianity you would know this is not possible . it is possible you had the title of christian without the relationship which gives you this title . christianity subscribes to the power of god to save you , not of any power of your own . if one could be come unsaved , he becomes more powerful than god ( impossible within christianity ) . well then . all of the ex - christians have it both ways do not they . since they are saved they can lie , cheat , steal and have wild , illicit sex ( following the example of several christian preachers ) .	1
anyone who looks at this situation logically should realize that at sometime in the past there must have been a time when there was less genetic damage in the genome . – and thus , longer lives . can anyone think of time that this may have happened ? i can ! the bible reports there was a time in the history of humans that lifespans were incredibly long . according to genesis people lived to over 900 years old . according to genesis ? why are you trying to present that as scientific evidence ? should i present the davinci code as scientific evidence ? how about darwin ' s on the origin of the species ?	1

quite right . the former nytimers and cnners are all familiar with this particular poster ' s distractions , fallacies , sockpuppets and ' i am really pro - gay ' shtick . he ' s been doing it for almost a decade now , and none of us are fooled . i hoped a direct challenge would show that - - one riposte to aa aside ( an attempt at camouflage , no doubt ) - - the leopard does not change his spots . mission accomplished . well , it ' s nice to know my assumption there was a dishonest ulterior motive ( rather than actually wanting to discuss it ) to the request was indeed correct . can not say i am surprised though . this poster has consistently avoided actual discourse with most anyone with whom he ' d find real disagreement ( gasp ! ) for as long as i have known of him , usually choosing instead to throw his easy ' drive - by ' insults from the peanut gallery . basically , he ' s a coward , and most anywhere else would probably be considered a troll .	1
i did say that if birth control failed ( condoms do sometimes too , i think their effectiveness is at like 97% , but that ' s not 100% ) abortion should be acceptable . i know some people want to ban the morning - after pill , but i think most people agree that it should be ok , i know i do . the day of conception , there is virtually no argument that the fetus is actually a human life that takes priority over the mother ' s life , unless they get into a purely religious rant about how the moment of conception the fetus is a human life that deserves the same rights as anyone . anyway , i do not agree with that . could you clarify the italicized sentence for me , please ? i do not understand if you are saying that the fetus takes priority or not . if so , why ? thanks . <repeated> monday morning fogginess .	0
the legalization of same - sex marriages ( or marriage - like civil unions or domestic partnerships ) would severely damage the public institution of marriage . it would send a false message that same - sex unions are equivalent to marriage , that same - sex relations and marriage contribute equally to society and provide equal potential for individual and social integrity , stability and happiness . it would convey the false message that whatever private sexual relationships adults choose deserve the same legal treatment as traditional marriages . legalizing same - sex marriage would create enormous conflict and confusion in the law and among legal systems . do you have any evidence of this that doean ' t come from a biased christian website ? so here is where you are saying nanny , nannie , poo , poo my straight realtionship is better than your gay relationship . how ? some big claims , can you provide some substance to them , in other words can you back this up with some data ? that does not come from some christian baised study .	0
the only difference is that the evolutionists are correct . <allcaps> btw </allcaps> , they have found the crater which was made by the asteroid . the mass extinction is a fact and so is evolution . your probably referring to the mexican basin crater . mass extinction does not prove evolution . the flood as described in the bible is an example of mass extinction . besides , in order for the asteroid theory to work , the asteroid would have to create an almost global tidal wave that would effectively kill the animals by drowning . also similiar to the effects of the flood .	0
" even the sight of guns , which people think of as objects that can hurt others , can induce aggressive ideas .

<url> she didnt really risk her own life , it was more a case of in the wrong place at the wrong time . she also did not sacrifice her life . she ' s still alive . to think she was any more a hero than any other serviceman or woman on the front lines is ludicrous , and to tell the truth , many of them arent heroes either . i think titles are passed around to quickly nowadays . now , if you are defending your mates who are injured from 50 ak - 47 wielding terrorists and you fend them all off , in the meanwhile losing 2 ligaments , i think thats cause for the use of the title of hero . jessica lynch ? hell no . it comes down to how you interpret what a hero is , for me , she is just propaganda for the bush admin ( or was ) . those who cannot see that are fools imho . drummond anyone who serves in the military is a hero . once you sign on the dotted line and take that oath , you are allowing for the possibility for death by combat at anytime . perhaps others did not get the recognition she got , but that ' s not her fault . the media needed a ' darling of enduring freedom ' poster child and she got picked .	0
hehei can not tell a difference between my philosophy and science , it is all knowledge that is gained through non - contradictory inquiry into reality . and yet quantum physics tends to be very contradictory , at least to our perceptions . acausal events happen . a particle can be in two places at the same time . a particle can disappear and reappear in a different location without traversing that distance . and et cetera . since the beginning of our local universe occurred at quantum levels , i would be cautious about drawing philosophical conclusions based on our macro - world experiences .	0
good questions . i agree that this logic is somewhat flawed ( unless quote mined ) . god could have made adam and eve . he could then have planted evidence that life evolved to this point . the miracle could have happened , too , in much the same way . see my post above , hi . marc ignores fundamentals of miller ' s beliefs that he clearly spells out in trying to push his anti - miller argument .	0
as has been pointed out to you now more than once , the most that can be ascertained from the evidence is that it was possibly done in some places - - perhaps in remote areas or areas that were not entirely in lockstep with rome ( or constantinople early on ) . there is much more evidence that the rcc has been consistent in it ' s belief that gay relationships are not a holy matrimony .

third , it is most tiresome to see all the horrors of the world ascribed to atheism when atheism has nothing to do with them . atheism has nothing to do with the nationalism of the nazis and fascists , has nothing to do with the cult of personality established by various dictators and similar . and do not even try to claim i do not know any of it . <allcaps> i live </allcaps> in the area you claim as " tito ' s slaughterhouse " . <allcaps> i know </allcaps> what it was all about . and atheism did not get even nearly close to the true causes . oh , buddy , atheism has <allcaps> everything </allcaps> to do with that . the morality - less framework of atheism <allcaps> allowed </allcaps> them to justify the horrors that they inflicted .	0
yes , it ' s supposed to be a ceteris paribus problem . okay , so people seem fairly agreed that , all else equal , less wrongful deaths are preferable to more wrongful deaths . now what i am curious about is eddie ' s third assumption , ' assumption three : two bad things is worse than 1 bad thing ' . now , it ' s obvious that there is a greater quantity in the number of things , but how does that quantity of things entail a lower moral quality of the outcome ? is two ' wrongs ' more ' wrong ' than one ' wrong ' ? or perhaps , is two ' bads ' more ' bad ' than one ' bad ' ? i would say so . but perhaps that ` s just my utilitarian leanings talking .	0
on the subject of analogies for genetic information , would " computer language " ( code ) be a better analogy ? indeed mutation and evolution could <emphasis> be shown with computer viruses . of course this would require some familiarity with computer code . <url> it would be ' an ' analogy , but like the language analogy , it has its limitations . it is interesting to note that creationist computer software developers / programmers cannot seem to agree on the implications of ' mutations ' when using such analogies - one such person , c.k. lester , declared that computer programs can accumulate up to 30% ' random change ' , just like <allcaps> dna </allcaps> ( hypothetically ) can , therefore , the computer analogy is a good one . but programmer r . david pogge declares that even a single altered bit in a line of computer code a million bits in length would destroy it .	0
i have no idea what mechanism / explanation you favour wrt biological evolution , but if it is the random , spontaneously generated , coincidental to organismic need , plus local , accidental , cull by chance environmental factor " natural selection " notion , then here ' s a surprise alert for you - - you believe in a notion that is intrinsically and essentially chance - based , that is , a notio9n that not only involves random accidents , but one that involves nothing but random , local , and anomalous accidents . there are no universal forces , such as gravity , electro - magnetism , weak and strong molecular forces , attached to your , " natural selection " . time for you to wake up and smell the coffee . <allcaps> rmns </allcaps> is nothing better than a childish superstition . somebody needs to check his little golden dictionary .

“ either god exists or he does not . it is a scientific question . the existence of god is a scientific question , like any other . ” this is idiotic . science investigates material phenomena , observable entities in the universe . no competent theologians or philosophers – not even the atheist ones – have ever declared that god ( if he exists ) is an object in his own universe . perhaps there is no god , and intelligent christians readily admit that there may be some legitimate doubt . but if the judaeo - christian god exists , then he is the maker of the universe and not an entity within it . so you are claiming the beardy bloke nailed to a couple of bits of 2 x4 did not actually exist ? emoticonxrolleyes	1

a computer never does anything but what it has been told to do given a certain stimulus . any real " decisions " were taken by the programmer . once a certain set of preconceived conditions are encountered , then the machine does what it was told to do if it encountered those conditions . the computer never makes up its own options and chooses its own preferred course of action . and this differs from your cell how ?

i did not attack either one of you at all . i just stated an ugly but very true fact concerning both your objectivity and your credibility . and regarding your sick hypothetical , it is not a valid question at all as its based on lytes unproven third hand slander , so i see no reason to play a what if game with someone who only seeks to corrupt the truth rather than discover what it is . but nice try . emoticonxgood calling someone a " liar " , " fool hardy " , " [ corrupter ] of the truth " , and unobjective is considered complimentary where you come from ? odd , but ok , i will go with it you lying brainwashed fool ( hey , this is fun ! i like using archie ' s compliments ! ) . actually , my " sick hypothetical " was a very valid question . i simply asked you if god commanded you to kill your neighbour for his sins , sins which you had no evidence of , would you do it . it seems like a fairly simple , straightforward question to me . why not answer it ? i see a pattern here archie . if someone asks you a tough question about your faith , you cry " corrupter ! blasphemer !

biology should not simply deal with the facts about different animals , natural selection , evolution , etc . but should also deal with how information is gathered , and different ways of analyzing it as well as different hypothesies rather than what is thought at the time to be the facts . if science deals with how information is gathered , different ways of analyzing , and different hypothesis , then it involves worldviews . the base for the worldview of a sizable part of the population should not be excluded . maybe in saddam hussien ' s iraq , maybe in communist russia , but not in the united states .	1
you need to read what people say more thoroughly , and think about it before you respond . when he said " can " ( and there are not many simpler words than that ! ) it did not mean " will " , " must " , or " shall " be more aggressive . it has been shown that in some cases it " <allcaps> can </allcaps> " happen . it may not have happened with you . it still might , we do not know . we might even say that it is not likely to happen , but we can not say that it will not , because sometimes some people do behave more aggressively when they have a gun . he stated that " statistics show that firearms cause aggression in individuals " , no mention of the word can anywhere in there that i saw .	1
careful there sarge . recently liberals in switzerland were successful in passing a mandate that militia members are no longer allowed to keep their service weapons and ammunition at home . they are no longer safe because of these pansies having their way . they are safer . the 300 gun deaths per year rate has dropped since then . let us have a little reality intrude on the gun porn fantasies . only 13% of swiss homes ever had an army - issue weapon in them , militia service extending only from age 20 to age 30 , and the ammunition was stored in a sealed pack , with severe punishments for the seal being broken .	0
i am not saying you should not argue against their weak moral position . i am saying you should not assume their emotions are what they would have to feel towards you to still oppose you if they shared your ethical system . of course they do not make one right . as for the kool - aid : i often see this referenced in arguments between americans , i have no idea what it is . i meant according to most christian theological viewpoints that oppose homosexual sex . but why should i care about their emotions ? they obviously do not care about mine . this is in reference to the jonestown massacre , where this cult leader convinced his followers to drink a soft drink ( i do not think it was actually kool - aid ) laced with cyanide . okay .	0
< snip of silly , irrelevant religious claptrap > creation is not a necessity , but i have yet to see substantial evidence to disprove it . but you have not looked . you may claim that your god did it , and no evidence to support or deny that can be offered . the assertion relies on miracle and has no suporting evidence . but when you start talking about how your god did it , your claims can be debunked by facts . certainly the mythology of ancient nomadic herdsmen is not accurate . if you look at the world and the history of the world the is evident in the geologic strata , then you can see that the earth is very old , and you can see a succession of organisms through time . when considered with other fields of science from genetics to biogeography to physiology and anatomy , evolution becomes apparent .	0

tell me , what did a cat evolve from ? how bout a dog ? horse ? shark ? see . <repeated> <url> uhm , you do realize that humans and chimps are not the same things as dogs , cats , horses , and sharks . <repeated> right ? i am under no obligation to address the evolutionary origin every possible organism . let us review the facts . 1 ) i said there is a ton of evidence for macroevolution , and there is . 2 ) i gave a specific example , saying that i could provide multipe lines of independent evidence supporting the fact that humans and chipms share a common evolutionary ancestor . and i can .	1
if all life evolved from a common ancestor , then there should be countless instances of new body parts evolving . body parts such as eyes , muscle , bone , etc . we have not seen one instance of a new body part evolving in a population in which it has not existed previously . evolutionists will wave the magic " time wand " and simply claim that such a change could never be observed in a few decades . what about fruit flies ? one generation of fruit flies = around a day . fruit flies were exposed to x rays to speed up mutation rates , we have observed the equivalent of millions of years ( in terms of human generations ) of super - accelerated mutation and . <repeated> no new body parts . evolutionists will also list in steps how a new body part can arise . this is only plausible if each of those steps could be directly observed . if not , then it is nothing more than science fiction . evolutionists have been searching for any direct evidence of the theory of evolution since the 1800 ' s . they are still looking . you have asked a good question cash , the way you know that is by all of the excuses you are getting rather than any attempts to actually answer you directly with solid evidence . of course we know that evidence does not exist , but they will never admit that either . emoticonxgood	0
as usual , the brady campaign is lying . the senate voted by a narrow margin to attach the riders to the manufaturers liability bill . then the senate voted and the bill as a whole was defeated 90 - 8 . even if it <allcaps> had </allcaps> passed the senate ( which we knew it would not ) it was expected to be killed in the house . here is an article on it : <url> decisive moment seemed to be during the later arguments on the bill . while they were debating whether or not to ammend the bill to include the assault weapons ban , feinstein ( d - california ) claimed that the assault weapons ban legislation " has reduced the proportion of banned assault weapons traced to crime by two - thirds . " during final arguments before the completed bill was voted on , craig ( r - idaho ) and young ( r - alaska ) got up there and completely shredded her numbers . it was made very clear by the end that she was a liar . god , i love cspan ! of course , the brady campaign has labeled this a " victory " . they can have all the victories like that ( where nothing at all happens ) that they can handle . teh house is still expected to pass the gun makers protection bill <allcaps> without </allcaps> the riders . senate leadership suggests that it can be fully expected to pass in the senate " the democrats simply do not have enough votes to stop it " . my my you are up on the current events . thanks for shedding light on this for everyone here .	0

we are all entitled to self - defense , but not all that is legal or moral is advisable . i am not against gun rights , or for the mad - regulators of the left ; but if i were zimmerman right now ( assuming he is telling the truth ) i would be kicking myself now until the day i die for not carrying pepper spray and trying that first . for investigating further when the police told me to keep my distance . for not telling martin i had a gun and i was willing to use it before he got close enough to knock me down . i agree there is plenty of possible damning evidence either way . one piece that would change everything is if zimmerman threw the first punch ; in which case trayvon would be defending himself and maybe zimmerman shot him because he was losing . that would not contradict known facts . freedom dearie are you serious about pepper spray ? just yesterday i presented a story where a taser and bean bag rounds from a shotgun did literally nothing against a 68 year old with a bad heart condition . what can a cheap chemical agent do against an adrenaline charged youth who ' s got more vitality and health on his side than a senior citizen in new york ?	0
hi ss . causing trouble again ? <happy> the cat experiment you describe cannot , unfortunately , be used to support lamarckian inheritance , because all the animals were denied the same essential nutrients , both the parents and the developing cats in the womb . logically , if lack of nourishment causes health problems in one generation it ' s inevitably going to cause the same problems in the next even without any evolution taking place . as others have pointed out , this experiment is evidence that adaptation to that restricted diet was not happening . had the cats initially suffered and then begun to get better , this would be strong evidence that adaptation was occurring . similarly , if you were denied vitamin c you would develop scurvy . if a pregnant woman was denied vitamin c - well , it hardly bears thinking about , but the fact the baby - were it to survive at all - would undoubtedly also suffer from scurvy is readily explicable by the observation that it , too , was denied vitamin c . now , if the baby was born with a functional vitamin c synthesising gene , that would be compelling evidence that organisms could intelligently respond to environmental changes . well i am not arguing that this is adaptation . <repeated> i have never said that . <repeated> what i am saying is the environment - - in this case diet is the cause for these traits to emerge in offspring . <repeated> but like i said earlier toe does not admit that the diet or any enviornmental variable can influence traits in offspring . traits are dictated by genes and genes are closed off from the enviornment . this is the basic dogma of weismann ' s barrier . i am not necessarily calling this evolution . <repeated> i am just simply pointing out that acquired traits can be inherited . there is no other way to describe this other than lamarckism . do you disagree that the inheritance of acquired characteristics is simply changes in physiology acquired over the life of an organism that are transmitted to offspring ?	0
lol . this entire argument is so inane . it ' s entirely based on the assumption that the bible is true . obviously that is the fallacy of begging the question . the bible as a whole is unverifiable , and for all we know was written back in the day by a guy who overdosed on opium . the idea of rapture is completely irrevelant until the bible is verified as fact . the argument has nothing to do with whether the bible is true or not , and everything to do with how certain concepts and interpretations are deduced from reading a piece of literature . i am not arguing that i believe in a rapture , but rather that there is biblical support for a rapture event . i hope you see the difference	0
when you decide to sin - you are making the decision , not god . he is just allowing it to happen . so you do have free will to make your own choices , but god must " approve " those choices . if the only choices we can possibly make are the one god approves , then we dont have free will , because we cannot free choose the option that god does not approve of , which means we are forced to only choose the options that god approves of . this is not free will	0
if somebody is not an evolutionist to you he / she is not " really " ascientist is he ? actually , that ' s not true . while all of the sciences actually support one another , one can be a chemist and not accept evolution . one can even do good science without accepting evolution , but it is difficult . for example , cosmology , astrophysics and astronomy see a very old universe . that ' s not compatible with young earth creationism . geology finds an old earth , wich is not compatible with the mythologies of sacred writings . but that is not to say that one cannot be a qualified scientist and a deist or a theist . there are lots of good christian scientists who accept evolution .	0

nice link . it destroys <allcaps> nato </allcaps> ' s higher death rate " argument " , and proves my point . california = " toughest gun laws " = 9.8 gun deaths per 100,000 population . florida = lax gun laws = 11.1 gun deaths per 100,000 population . emoticonxrolleyes and right at the top of the list , at a whopping 31.2 per 100,000 , is washington dc , even though they had a complete and total gun ban in place . how the hell do you explain that ? nobody could own handguns , nobody could ever carry a gun , nobody could have a gun outside of their home , nobody could even load their private guns , so how do they get to be at the top of the list or death rates ?	0
ecause of his direct encounter with christ in a special way . it is not necessary that all the apostles should be equally inspired to only write teachings and letters like paul , just like all the organs of a body do not take part of the same the function , but the nevertheless , all contribute to the making and building of the body . why do conservatives support conservatives ? paul ' s theology found favor with the christians that won amongst the early churches . paul was not considered an apostle by the original 11 and barnabas . luke does not have him meet a risen jesus only paul says he did . his first missionary trek was a failure and the next two he was not equal with barnabas . but the apostles did not teach the same as paul , similiar but not the same .	0

it ' s just a term for someone who has decided to live in a way that is not gay . they may be " gay " physiologically ( whatever that means in terms of biology ) , but they are living in a way that does not give in to that - - which is what matters from their religious standpoint . many people live against urges ( regarding various issues ) all the time . ironically , gay pride has itself largely to blame for the ' ex - gay ' movement . i think it ' s an example of some gays swinging back against the ' out - and - proud ' far left shift - - religious gays are , in effect , saying they do not have to abide by your prescription for their lives . and you are mentally disturbed . did not i say that there is no such thing as a " ex - gay " ? <repeated> did i stutter ? you can pretend that denial is a river over in egypt . somebody thinking that they can successfully " supress " their true orientation , and deny themselves homosexual contact , is delusional . <repeated> because the truth will always come out . <repeated> because that ' s what the truth does . show me an ex - gay , and i will show you a liar . where are they , that i can query them ? i will wait .	1

so the solutions to gun violence proposed by gun activists in this thread seem to be - 1 ) more prison time . 2 ) more guns and have more shootouts between the bad guys and good guys . yet , in other developed nations that have much lower rates of gun violence there are a lot less gun owners and people in prison . so are gun activists trying to sell people snake oil ?

i fail to understand the fascination with mrs . kerry ' s wealth . george washington inherited wealth , including money and property . and then proceeded to marry the wealthiest widow in dc , who had far more wealth than george . the only reason i can fathom for people condemning kerry for marrying wealth is jealousy . all other things being equal , i ' d take a well - traveled , multi - language , filthy rich woman actively engaged in various sectors of society over a dirt - poor librarian every time . ( no slur on librarians , i know some who are fine people , including a wealthy one , just a comparison for the thread ) as to mrs . kerry ' s tax filing extension , that ' s available to any and all taxpayers . all one does is pay the taxes due and request an automatic extension for filing . and that extension can , with reasonable cause , be again extended all the way into october . along with some others here , you have missed the point . i know we all have the ability to file extensions for various reasons . i do not really care how much money they have . more power to them for being filthy rich . a candidate for president is supposed to reveal his ( and spouse ' s ) tax returns . teresa has apparently asked for an extension just to have it revealed after the convention . why ? is there anything to hide that would hurt kerry ' s chances of even being nominated ? this has nothing to do with the average citizen .	0

because africa is not one big homogeneous ecosystem . there are jungles , plains , deserts , swamps . himps living in the jungle were not in competition with himps that started migrating out onto the plains . their food sources are different , their territories are different . the more suited to plains - dwelling we became , the less attractive a prospect it was to return to the jungle . pretty straightforward , really . but himps living in the jungle were in competition with other himps which did not migrate to the plains . and pressures from predators , climate and changes in the ecosystem should have continued to force the need or desire to control their environment as our line of himp grew to do . my point is that with all of the same basic tools to start out with such as fingers , opposable thumbs and walking upright , there is no reason why only our line evolved to the level that human beings have attained with the same hundreds of millions of years , and the same pressures pushing us all forward , or towards extinction .	0

i can not protect my family from extended family interference without marriage . i can not designate who will receive my social security benifits without marriage . i can not protect my partner from having to pay 50% inheritence taxes on a property she already owns without marraige . i can not live in an assisted living center with my partner if / when that time should come , without marriage . i can not get married to my partner in mass . and leave the area and have our marriage recognized in anyother state , without legalize federally recognized , completely 100% portable marriage ! in short , you are full of carp . there are almost 1,100 rights , protections and priveledges that are given to ' married ' couples , who almost alway take them for granted , which are flat out denied to gay / lesbian couples . what extended family interference ? even mass same - sex marriages can not get ss benefits . you should research joint tenants in common becasue that is not true that is not a gaornment decision . that is a business decision . businesses can decide to allow it if they want to , so marriage would not change that . i am saying what can not you do without it . not about marriages in mass . also the federal government would not recognize it anyways because of defense of marriage act . so far you have not named one yet . also as couples you do not have that right but individually you have the rights as any citizen . calling me full of * * * * while i just showed you have you are wrong . <repeated> funny .	0

i aborted my 6 1 / 2 week old baby and i am extremely offended by comments that portray me and women like me as ' violent ' . i had my abortion for my own personal reasons that have nothing to do with any of you , and should not be any of your business . steve , nobody was saying that you have to give 100% of yourself to your cause or otherwise you do not really believe in it . what they are trying to say is that you come on here and spout your opinions but you do not really seem to present any indication that you do anything in your personal life to confront abortion . i would like to call myself a revoluntionary feminist but i feel like that would be lying because i do not feel like i do enough for the cause to call myself one . see the point ? i just love how you call it a baby and not ' contents of the uterus ' or ' product of conception ' or ' fetus ' . the truth is , that was a child .	0

this post contains a perfectly simple explanation of why toe is a sham along with a challenge to any darwinist to prove me wrong . toe is constructed on a fraud premise . this premise says that the fundamental unit of evolution is the gene . whenever an evolutionist talks about “ evolution ” he ' s not talking about mere phenotypic change – he ' s talking about changes in genes . to a darwinist , just because an animal changes phentoypically , or even if he passes these changes down to progeny does not mean that “ evolution ” has occurred . a fish could morph into a human , but if there are no changes in genes then this would not be considered " evolution . " the only way evolution can happen , by their own definition , is if there is a change in genetics . this premise , i suggest is a complete and total fraud . <repeated> and i will explain why now : let us take humans and dogs , for example . when compared side - by - side , sure enough , humans may have an assortment of genes that dogs do not – and possibly the other way around . but just because humans may have certain genes that dogs do not , does not mean that these genes cause the difference between humans and dogs . of course , there are no “ dog genes ” or “ human genes . ” but likewise there are no “ tongue genes , ” “ tail genes ” or “ toenail genes . ” parts are not translated genes . thus , the assertion that new genes got created or that individual genes mutated over time to chnage one kind of animal into another is blatantly false and physically impossible . but it ' s worse than that . as i said before , humans have a whole slew of genes – theoretically , at least - - that dogs ( or other animals ) do not have . but evolutionists still contend that these genetic differences cause the difference between the organisms ! that ' s why they analyze <allcaps> dna </allcaps> with such scrutiny ! but did it ever dawn on them that studying genetics is a compete waste of time because of the real possibility that each dog or each human has the genes they have because of what they are ? scientists have been telling us for decades that who or what we are is determined by what genes we have . <repeated> but they have got it backwards ! instead , we have the genes we have because of who we are . a dog is not a dog because he barks ; a dog barks because of what he is . same with genes . this , of course , spells destructin to toe because it means genetic evolution is a fraud . evolution , thus , should not be a theory based on changes in genes , but a theory based on changes in traits . but scientists continue to mess around with genes and try to make the body do weird things by mutating them . they simply will not give up because they have seen correlations between gene activity and various physiological responses . but here ' s where they are screwing everything up : when you were a kid did you ever stand on your head ? if so , did your face ever get red if you stayed upside down for a period of time ? if so , do you admit that it was the act of being upside down that caused the blood to rush to your head ? or , do you have the audacity to claim that you were upside down because your face was red ? that ' s excactly what science is doing with genetics : they have got the audacity to claim that changes in genes ( the red face ) is causing the organsim to change physiologically ( go upside down . ) in reality , what ' s happening is the organism is experiencing a new environment ( turning upside down ) and then the genes are responding in kind ( turning red ) . the only way you can prove this logic wrong is to do one of two things : 1 ) show me conclusively that mutations happen completely randomly and unoriented to environmental pressures . 2 ) show me that the same environmental pressures on genes will not produce the exact same physiological effects over and over and over . so there it is . go for it . so what this guy is saying is that he believes in natural selection but not evolution ?	0
" hi it ' s me " wrote : " dr . phillip johnson has been called ' our age ' s clearest thinker on evolution ' and the ' principal lay critic of darwinism . ' he is the author of darwin on trial , reason in the balance , defeating darwinism by opening minds , and objections sustained . " he was obviously called that by fellow creationists . i also note that he wrote plenty of books . i did not realize that there was that much to cover . how much can you write about a topic you do not understand or try to misinterpret ? walking - fish : i love it when creationists / iders quote phillip johnson , but i hate the fact that he has my first name . lawyers make excellent sophists , being able to support both sides of an argument with equal effectiveness . they can expound forever about topics they are totally ignorant about . and this is what makes mr johnson such a valuable resource for the creationist movement . that ' s it ? that was your post ? to attack a source without anything backing you up ? bravo !	1

i was requested to start a new thread in which pro - gay and anti - gay marriage positions could be debated without posters being called " homophobes " , " gay bashers " and " bigots " simply because they do not favor gay marriage . while i " ve already stated why i am against gay marriage in previous threads , i will reiterate them here for newbies and for simplicity sake . 1 . gay marriage creates a new dependent class of citizen2 . it is an unfunded mandate and therefore , illegal3 . it forces additional costs on an employer via healthcare benefits4 . it adds costs to the court system via increased litigation over custody , property , inheritance , etc . , 5 . it allows more people to lay claim to finite ss and other entitlement benefits6 . it establishes a loophole to transfer property without payment of inheritance taxes . 7 . it establishes a mechanism to bypass the payment of taxes on life insurance payouts . these should be enough fodder to get the ball rolling . you know what i find amusing here . <repeated> your entire argument revolves around how it will affect your wallet . forget about the lives of the people who are denied rights in this country that you take forgranted . that is the true christian - american spirit is not it ? oh how proud our forefathers would be if they could see us now . <repeated> oh wait . <repeated> most of them owned people . <repeated> nevermind .	1

morality , in the strictest sense of the word , deals with that which is innately regarded as right or wrong . the term is often used to refer to a system of principles and judgments shared by cultural , religious , and philosophical concepts and beliefs , by which humans subjectively determine whether given actions are right or wrong . you do know the difference between right and wrong do not you ? i see no reason teachers should not play a part in attempting to teach pupils the difference . up to a point , but ther are things some people would consider ' wrong ' that others would not . for example , most muslims would consider drinking alcohol to be wrong , while most non - muslims would not . some people believe it is wrong to hit someone , whether or not they have hit you , others believe you have a right to retaliate . some believe that sex is a big deal and should be reserved only for marriage , others believe any activity between consenting adults is morally ok . all of these are moral issues . which view should schools teach ? should they teach that killing people is wrong ? how about stealing ? should they put things in context , so that stealing is only wrong in a society that recognises personal property . should they conflate morality with law ? that opens yet another can of worms .	0

this is directly from their website : thousands did not die , this number was known to be made up . see . <repeated> <url> <url> the number of illegal abortions is also overstated . <repeated> some estimate it is only around 100,000 . <repeated> considering 1973 only had around 800,000 abortions it doen ' t seem likely that a year before 1 million were done illegally . based on what ? you admit there were 800,000 abortions performed in 1973 but yet if you dared to check the fertility rate between 1972 to 1973 it is nearly static ; meaning there were just as many people giving birth before and after roe . surely , 800,000 potential births being aborted would have cut the fertility rate sharpely but it did not . you do not have to be a rocket - scientist to speculate what this means ; that just as many women were having abortions between 1972 - 1973 and roe v wade only changed who was performing these abortions . <repeated> not whether people were having them or not .	0

that is an incorrect statement . viability seems to be the topic that gets little mention here . humanity , consciousness , personhood , sentience , etc . are all extremely debatable , as has been demonstrated , sometimes ad nauseam . to you , it may be an incorrect statement . but if it is , you have to tell me what it is you kill and take the life away from when you abort the zygote . not knowing if it is being killed or not knowing someone wants to kill it makes no difference . injustice is still practiced there , and not even some abortion doctors realize it .	0

abstinence programs and gay rights are two quite separate issues . no one is trying to enact any law in this country to make it illegal to have sex before marriage . regardless , there ' s no way anyone can argue that abstinence programs are about ' straight pride ' or somehow about being straight , which was the context of the discussion when these examples came up . abstinence until heterosexual marriage is not encouraging heterosexual marriage ? i have never heard of an abstinence - until - domestic - partnership program . perhaps you could point us to an inclusive abstinence - only program somewhere . perhaps not . <repeated>	1

people make definitions . they then make statements that make sense according to those defintions . you interept their statements terms of your own defintions . maybe your definition are in a sense better but many people adopt the position that when someone defines things you interept them using their defintions <allcaps> and their defintions alone </allcaps> . you do not seem to think this should be done . this is the main reason why people treat you the way they do . it actually has little to do with them practicing objectivism or scientism . for one to have evolution as their foundation belief , means that one cannot be certian of anything . <repeated>	1

i think its finally settled that physical ( testable or tangible ) evidence of god can never be found . this is not only because of its elusive nature to science , but also because of religious requirements . from a scientic perspective , nothing ever occurs outside of the realm of phyical law . that ' s not quite right . more accurate would be : nothing that occurs outside the realm of physical law is in the realm of science . science by no means precludes the possibility of there being something outside the realm of science .	0

i am used to reading non sequiturs from you , but how on earth you imagine this follows in any way from the post you quote eludes me completely . is north korea a bastion of peace and good - living ? nope . is it religious ? nope . therefore obstacles to ' peace ' do not necessarily have to be tied in with religiosity . hope that ' s spelt out enough for you . try to keep up .	1
i have hardly ever heard any christian try to convince anyone they are all consistent and harmonized . and i have been around a lot of christians . maybe you ' d actually get more christians to consider your points if you ' d stop flinging accusations of scams and rudely calling things that are dear to them ' fairy tales ' . but hey , it ' s your loss . i can not help it if fairy tales are dear to your heart dude , i am just telling it like it is . christians all over the country try to claim the gospels are in harmony . <repeated> and very rarely , if ever , have i found a christian who will admit the contradictions in the bible . they try to explain away contradictions with lies and made up versions of their own but will never admit the truth . <repeated> no loss here , i have never since i came here hid the fact i do not like religion . it ' s nothing personal against anyone in particular , but if you happen to be religious and fall under the weight of truth i can not help if your feelings get hurt . would you rather me feed you a line of x <elongated> so you will fall for it , i mean come on , religion already did that right > . <repeated> emoticonxbouncer	1

i am speaking of the christian church . no offense to folks of other faiths . i am simply interested in what folks of any faith would say to this . as a protestant , i would say the purpose of the church is to ' be jesus to the world ' . individuals within the church are to use their god given gifts for the building up of the body to love one another and show the world what love is . any other thoughts , ( or similar thoughts ) . remember we are looking at what ought not what is . by ' church ' . <repeated> do you mean the group of people who are christian ( ie . congregation ) ? the institution of church ? to orthodox , the church is a living earthly embodiment of jesus christ . the role of orthodox is to be like god . <repeated> by following his example . we are called to return to him , but we are separated from him by sin . we are living icons of god .	0

mass . lawmakers delay vote on gay - marriage ban <url> the anti - gay family groups ( mass resistance , etc . ) are not happy about this move . time is on our side , as more time passes more and more people are in support of full marriage equality . i am a little surprised by this . the polls i have seen show that mass voters favor gay marriage . i would have thought that getting those who oppose it to put their opposition on the record before the elections would be beneficial . then again , seeing as how the lies and fear mongering have already started , i can see how they might want to avoid having the elections muddied with the inevitable dirty fighting that would be thrown at them . not the most couragous stance , but perhaps safer in the long run . you are right that the longer society fails to collapse the more inane the doomsayers seem .	0

originally posted by galileo why do people on the pro - gun side continuously try to oversimplify the issue ? no one is really arguing that there would be zero murder without guns . the question is would there be less murders without guns . in developed nations with stricter gun laws there are less murders . at any rate , i do not think you can draw such conclusions based on one incident . your <allcaps> x <elongated> </allcaps> - umption that is a poor attempt to certify a false delimma has long been answered . how many people have been killed in africa with short handled hoes and machetes ? nary a gun amoungst them .	0
they used to keel over regularly before modern medicine and my wife has been on medication for a thyroid condition ever since she delivered .

you talked about a ' natural bias ' that would stop evolution in its tracks . you are going to have to be more specific about what ' stopping evolution in its tracks ' means . do you mean preventing inheritable variation ? preventing natural selection ? preventing gene flow ? what ? things like future proof of a young earth - evolution needs billons of years . or proof of severe weather conditions that would destroy the evolutionary process . life on earth dies completely if it gets out of a fairly narrow temperature range , any time during those billions of years .	0
people have claimed that owning a gun makes you more likely to be shot . well , there is the risk of suicide , but i am talking sane people here . so how would owning a firearm make the owner more likely to be shot ? how would it make him more likely to be killed ? accidents for one . just last week a man who was drinking and cleaning his firearm accidentally shot and killed his daughter . run a google search for " man shoots self " the amount of accidental shootings is rather disturbing yet funny . most of these however are due to improper gun safety though .	0

legislative solutions and popular appeal are not the same thing . the legislature is hired to do what ' s right , not what ' s popular . that aside , where has the gay rights movement used voting as anything except a measure of last resort ? if gays knew they could count on popular support they would not need to fight to get their rights protected . we know this . we also know that ' s there ' s lots of big money opposing gay rights , and sadly enough money is often the deciding factor in voting . so where is voting being used as anything other than a last ditch attempt to accomplish something for the gay rights movement ? well , you ignored the part where i said ' voting ' . but imo legislative solutions are part and parcel to popular appeal because legislators are voted in on that basis . any legislator claims to ' do what ' s right . ' so elections tend to be popularity contests . and legislators tend to want to keep their constituents happy . oh and just to make sure you understand this kronos so as not to get off in the wrong direction , this is my opinion , just like everything else i have said . it is not a lie . how is that even relevant ? i never claimed it was a first resort .	0

very nice propaganda , siegfriedson . why do not you tell us about the terrorist activity that necessitated military activity that inevitably caused also civilian deaths . the shooting of the 13 - year - old girl is a terrible exception and i think the officer should be severely punished ( i think he was ) . the point is that israel tries to avoid civilian casualties whenever it is possible , hamas and other terrorists target civilians on purpose . here are the reasons for anti - terror operations in the west bank and gaza : list of victims since september 2000 suicide attacks just since january 2004 ( does not include mortar and rocket attacks that happen on almost a daily basis ) : tel - aviv feb 25 2005 karni crossing jan 13 2005 tel - aviv nov 1 2004 sinai ( taba hilton ) oct 10 2004 beersheba aug 31 2004 ashdod march 14 jerusalem feb 22 2004 jerusalem jan 29 2004 i love how hamas apologists require showing idf abuses to defend their actions . pathetic .	0

blood relationships are never based on choice , yet they entail moral obligations , nonetheless . this is why the courts prosecute negligent parents . they have consistently ruled , for example , that fathers have an obligation to support their children even if they are unplanned and unwanted . every relationship does entail moral obligations in one way or another , but the argument is that there is no relationship that morally obligates one to share ones body . they are trying to generalize ' moral obligations ' as if that justifies anything . there are things that cannot be morally obligated , no matter the relationship , so the argument tries to prove .	0

fortunately , the bolshevik revolution failed . 1989 , the berlin wall came a - tumbling down , along with soviet ideology . communism is a failed philosophy and the free world has soundly rejected it . socialsim and communism in the soviet union failed because the <allcaps> ussr </allcaps> spent its entire existence recovering from war . the country was bombed to hell by germany twice , around the time of the world wars . the united states put unspeakable amounts of money into their war machine , which forced the soviets to do the same . i , for one , would buy a gun if i knew my neighbor had six , and he wanted me dead . the <allcaps> cia </allcaps> and american military carried out immoral operations in 60 + countries since 1945 . the soviet <allcaps> kgb </allcaps> , as far as i know , has only been in germany , korea , china , and afgahnistan .	0
so again , i do not want to know the things you can disprove or philosophize about . i want to see the evidence . given that , you will surely begin to change my mind . i hope i have already begun to change your mind .	0
originally posted by unkerpauliethe fact is that evil and good exist , and that we can by no means use the existence of evil to conclude that god doesnt exist , because by definition the existence of evil substantiates that good exists and therefore actually supports the argument for god first off , no one says that if there is evil , there can not be a god . they say that if there ' s evil , then god can not be omnipotent and all benevolent . let us keep the topics straight . also , i see no way in which the existence of good bolsters the argument that god exists . i could posit the existence of a god of popcorn , and then say " look , here ' s some popcorn , my god must be real ! " somehow , i do not think that would convince you .	1
that does not even make sense . how do you help an abused young girl stay safe by making sure the abuser does not get reported ? i want to know how giving her abusers more reason to abuse her makes sense too .	1
actually , yes i do support full medical care for our veterans with injuries sustained while serving their country . i do not know why you would think i do not . the issue is that the government has never done anything efficiently or effectively within estimated budgetary constraints . name one government agency or beaurocracy which runs within its budget . and the estimated cost for this socialized medicine is 2 trillion dollars over what , 10 years ? and the estimated actual costs are trillions more than that very conservative estimate . but you do not care about facts . you do not even want to take the time to actually read the bill . just pass it now and worry about the consequences later . print up more money until a dollar is not worth a mexican peso . emoticonxgood now is not that a terribly socialistic position to take ? but , i am confused by it at the same time , for socialists like you do not really want to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs now do you ? emoticonxrolleyes when logic fails , there ' s alway ad hominem , right ? and the ad hominen continues . <repeated> we are larger , more diverse , more litigious , need i go on ? leaving the continued ad hominem aside , one of the causes for our high healthcare costs is litigation . since the dnc survives on the money derived from the blood - sucking trial lawyers lobby , i do not see real reform occurring until we cut those purse strings along with the big pharma ' s .	0
3 ) there ' s no evidence for the big bangsadly , yes , i have actually seen this one fairly often . i have no idea where people get the idea that scientists make things up without having good evidence behind it ( oh wait … we are out to disprove god because all scientists hate god or some <allcaps> x <elongated> </allcaps> like that ) . now everyone will know marc was right all along - - that there is an atheist science conspiracy .	0
i found this by chance and really could not resist replying : ' these are people captured on the battlefield . ' please define whjat is measnt by battlefield exactly , my understanding is that battlefield = anywhere on earth ' many of the ones released have been either recaptured or shot in combat ' sorry i do not beleive your corporate controlled bullshit media . ' because they are terrorists ! ' all i have to say to this revolting excercise in hypocrisy is the following : <url> ' this is war people , you have to start entering the reality of the situation . ' really , oh well when you put it that way , actually just out of curiosity who are you fighting against , oh yeah , a tactic called terrorism which you use more than any other nation on earth . your true colours are on display for all to see , good day :0 oh yeah , i forgot that you believe that the corporate media and corporate leaders have gotten together to create war and put innocents in jail . i will admit that the powers of the executive branch have gone way too far , but i still believe that being at war means we have to treat the enemy like our enemy , and not like american civilians . do i agree with the war ? no . but that ' s only because i feel that we could have done this all with special forces and not with an invasion / occupation . i would still support detaining terrorists captured in battle / mission ( and if they are americans , give them a proper trial , not a military tribunal or some bullshit like that ) .	0

men should not be deciding because they can not get pregnant after being raped . when was the last time a man ' s life was ever at risk because his wife was pregnant ? since when does the fate get decided by the victim ? a woman could be said to have a biased opinion on it because she is an involved party . even so , i take the stand that no one has any authority over the other to make that decision .	0
considering how symbiote has you running around in circles trying to pathetically defend your contridictions , apparently it is you who does not understand . trying to argue with a person who is babbling nonsense is not my idea of a productive time to spend my time . i have explained myself and that ' s the end of it . you can label my posts anything you want but that does not mean anything . it just means you are proficient in throwing out insults . so for purposes of this discussion i crown you the " insult king " of this forum .	1
evolutionists have taught for decades that the second law of thermodynamics — the entropy principle that things naturally decrease in complexity rather than increase — poses no barrier to evolution . their claim is that while there is an overall downhill trend in nature , uphill innovations can occur locally in a system if abundant energy is available . specifically the sun ' s energy provides all that is necessary to transform inorganic chemicals into a living cell and eventually into people . all that is necessary is an open system and abundant energy , especially the sun ' s energy . if complicated living organisms can be created in this way , certainly something not nearly so complicated as a house could be produced . especially a solar - powered house ! that ' s obviously not what is said . the sun ' s energy is not claimed to be a mechanism that makes order of disorder . what it does do is override the tendancy within the 2 lotd where total usable energy in a system decreases .	0
did you come up with that one yourself ? or did you have help by someone trying to silence the truth of those statements of fact ? my , you did a lot of work in order to try and get me banned , to boot ! someone ' s help ? whoever are you talking about ? it wasn ' t any much work at all . a simple search . i am pointing it out to you in the hopes that you will get some new material . that and the fact i ' d rather not see you banned .	1
no , not because it was a troll thread . i said no such thing . i said i was reporting the thread for the admin to look at the posts in it because it was filled with spam between o_c and archangel due to archie and o_c ' s ongoing feud with one another . i said i am sick of both of them and their bs wasting badwidth on the fora . i said nothing in the positive nor negative about the thread itself being a troll thread - just that it was filled with their spam from their lover ' s spat . - - one would think that someone ( such as yourself ) so concerned about people posting truthfully about other posters would do so in their own posts . <repeated> just a question , can someone show me where symbiote posted at all on the thread ? 4 forums . com political debates and polls - search results he ' s got 4 posts in the past day . none of which are about what cashburnrate / yankee fan / roesgen08 says they are . sorry giantorio for cluttering the forum . and thanks cashburnrate / yankee fan / roesgen08 , you just proved my point . when i prove you are wrong , you just change your argument and insult me for failing to prove your new argument you just created . you did this as yankee fan on lw . you did this here as cashburn . you are doing it again as roesgen08 . same exact story .	0
oh , so now it ' s a fetus ? in your other posts it was a " baby " cunx . are you being dense on purpose ? i said that i am not all into the semantics of baby / fetus . i will conceid that its killing a baby . the <allcaps> term </allcaps> for it is fetus , fetus ' become babies . i see the logic there ( in fact i think i am agreeing with you ) . why must you keep pounding this drum ?	1
problem is that the right to marry is not a clear constitutional right . it is a right that has been interpreted by courts on an illegitimate legal theory known as substantive due process . i see - - in your opinion is it is " illegitimate " , therefore it must be so . i think i trust the legal opinions of the courts more , but then , they do occasionally make mistakes . it ' s just not at all obvious they have made one in this instance .	1

in florida about 7.5 million votes were cast for president . bush has the lead , with 100% reporting , by 376,923 votes . this is somewhere along the lines of a 376,386 increase in his margin of victory in fl compared to 2000 . in new mexico , approximately 700,000 votes were cast . bush has the lead , with 99% reporting , by 12,170 votes . he lost this state in 2000 . the last election in which a candidate for president received a plurality was in 1984 . ronald reagan carried 59% of the popular vote and 525 electoral votes . today is 2004 , approximately 30 years between an election where the presidential candidate received a plurality . i am not disputing the numbers , and i am certainly not disputing the fact that bush won . what i am intrigued about is the razor thin margins , to my mind anyway , that characterize the us election system . do not you find it the least bit odd that it ' s been 30 years since a president received a plurality ? waxy	0
rovdak , are you forgetting that ivf and cloning technologies are abortive technologies ? so much bs . <repeated> where should i start ? eugenics is about manipulating genomes of populations . since when are most abortions performed for the purpose of lowering or raising the frequency of certain alleles or traits in populations ? if a woman wants to maximize her life , liberty , and happiness , and she feels that she can best do so by aborting a pregnancy , your intended prevention of that action ' flies in the face of the declaration of independence ' . <repeated> ( not that the declaration has any legal standing . ) whether an embryo or fetus is human is irrelevant . no thing , human or not , has the right to subsist completely on a human without the latter ' s consent . ' abortive technologies ' ? you sound like falwell , insisting that cloning destroys life when it does nothing of the sort . please explain your laughable statement .	1
just read the following story . my question is thus , should this child be put to death per bible based rules governing a child ' s unruleiness ? you know , if the god deniers even let the baby out of the mother ' s womb alive to begin with then he ' s already one step ahead of the game . as for what to do with him then , show me under the new covenant where jesus said to stone kids ? personally , i think we should stone obese , jaded statues of weird looking holy men .	1
at the time , i was picturing something along the lines of a t - rex with chicken legs . but still , unles the beast above the legs had developed to be lighter , it would overwhelm the more spindly birdlike legs . theropods had hollow bones like birds . it was " developed to be lighter [ sic ] .

you should also note that the one scenario i think the death penalty is acceptable for is if they try to escape using violence or if they attack another prisoner . this has shown that they are willing to commit acts of violence and frankly have nothing to so the initial murder wasn ' t enough to show " that they are willing to commit acts of violence " ? this makes absolutely no sense .	0
the idea of abortion as population control is absurd , especially forced abortions as someone mentioned a few posts ago . anyone who has read a biology book knows the world has methods of population control on its own , we do not need to be doing stuff like that ourselves . this stat sounds more than a bit inflated . seeing as it comes from a website called " women ' s issues " it is probably not all that credible . actually the alan guttmacher institute is quite reputible . they have their own web site . check it out . also , why would a site called " womens issuses " be in valid ?	0
i have had to really change my point of view of how people ( male and female ) look at life lately , greg . although i can see your pov , i also see a growing defeatist attitude , at least area - wide here . that is one reason i changed my custom user title , which means : life happens live with it . why the despairing attitude ? hopelessness , i thinkwhere that comes from i have no idea . okay , my computer is too slow to go search some statistics and copy the url to try and defend my opinion ; but , here is my opinion anyway . one reason there are so many crimes against women , or crimes in general , is that offenders are repeat offenders much of the time . how many times have you heard of a child molester being released from prison and repeating the crime ? there is not much determent to crime when criminals are put in jail for a year and on their first parole hearing are released back on the street to repeat offenses . i do not know what the answer is - - but i think that is the reason there are so many crimes , especially sex crimes .	0
my dear , i do not know who first invented the word ' christianist ' , but i saw it used frequently on andrew sullivan ' s website , and he ' s no liberal , just another christian conservative , only not a complete idiot . it denotes the sort of bigots who think that not only are christians better than anyone else , but that everyone else should be compelled to abide by the religious laws desired by christianists . not all christians are christianists . but you can recognise a christianist by his bigotry , and opposition to everyone who is not like him . christianists believe that the only legitimate government is one that lives by their religious principles . there are lots of them around , virtually all supporters of the gop . that ' s your crowd . my dear ; sweetie ; ( and any other ridiculous and intentionally patronizing words you regularly use ) i do not support the gop . i think both parties are corrupt . you on the other hand , seem to have sold your soul to the dnc a long time ago .	0

we saw this in the recent supreme court decision . they chose to focus a lot on the role handguns could play in defending house and home against criminals , but seemed to have no problem with a ban on machine guns - the kind of guns that would logically seem to be most protected by the second amendment because of their usefulness in military conflicts which would make them a better deterrent against tyranny than other types of firearms . thus , the supreme court chose to " strain at a gnat and swallow a camel " to use a biblical idiom in their treatment of the second amendment . now you are playing word games to confuse people . page 11 of the heller ruling stated that the definition of " arms " include all modern forms of bearable arms that ' re in common use . they did not rule on machineguns because they were not part of the case .	0

if literal creationism is indeed true , why do we not find strata with species from all eras mixed together ? we do . <repeated> most fossils found are surface finds - - which means anything found on the ground probably contradicts uniformitarian principles because every fossil found laying on the ground probably - - according to toe - - did not die at the same time . for example , many mammal bones are found on the surface - - yet so are dinosaur and other " ancient " bones from animals that supposedly lived millions of years beforehand . of course evolutionists will come back and claim " erosion " with no evidence of such , not to mention how rock can be removed from bone after millions of years of being cemented to it . i have got a 900 - page book called " hidden archeology " ( cremo ) that dives into hundreds of fossils and artifacts that are in the " wrong " strata . your assertion is blatantly false .	0

remember that darwin referred to evolution as the secondary cause by which " the creator " acted . so , when miller says " i believe in darwin ' s god " , he is saying that god sustains the natural process of evolution and an intermediate agent . and if the " natural process of evolution " is determined by humans in a university lab , many with an atheist worldview , that clash with something the bible says , you and kenneth miller immediately toss the bible out and accept what the humans say - no questions asked ?	0

i agree with you , that ' s just plain silly . first of all we do not know if a soul even exist , and secondly , even if we had proof that it did , we have no way of knowing when it becomes reality for that person . maybe it ' s like sin , you know , a man - made concept <wink> you want to consider a <allcaps> zef </allcaps> a ' person ' - fine , let us apply this so - called ' logic ' across the board . if a woman should for whatever reason die while giving birth , then the baby should serve a life prison sentence for murder emoticonxgood have a nice day emoticonxangel never thought of that . if that " person " has rights , do they have responsibilities ? could a fetus be charged for causing toxemia ? how about suing the little tyke for giving mom varicose veins and stretch marks ?	1
rationalization is probably the worst way to prove what you are doing is ' ok ' . this is what you sound like ' well , billy is doing so it is ok for me to do it !

it begins to look , then , that this is a piece of crude propaganda ( see note below ) , deliberately manipulated to give the false impression that the fact of evolution is seriously under scientific question , and that the fanciful notions of creation ` scientists ' are contributing to that debate . well then , my skeptic fellow australians , what is the answer to the question ? do any of you guys here know ? i sure as hell do not . creationists did not misquote dawkins because the words came from his mouth . and dawkins is a professional at biology , but he could not answer such a question . in the little amount of fossils that we do see , they are not evolutionary . there is no clear cut fossils showing the evolution of man , is there . by " true human " i mean they were just like us , just varients of human kind that we have today - looked human , walked like us , most likely were quite intelligent . i have got to go to school , continue this later .	0

then explain to me why a pregnant woman was hit by a car not long ago leading to the death of both mother and baby . resulting in a double vehicular homicide charge being leveled against the driver ? how can that be if the unborn child does not have rights as a human being ? and why could the mother have aborted that baby legally if she chose to ? is not that a true catch 22 for the unborn , and a contradiction in the law ? because that the law one has to presume and of course the law applied to that specific case . as to it being contradictory - well the law is loaded with contradictions if you look at all closely . on the other hand consider that the driver killed the woman <allcaps> and </allcaps> obviously damaged her fetus beyond recovery - <allcaps> without </allcaps> the consent of the woman . in other words the death of the fetus was not by consent of the person who holds the right to decide but rather by the negligence or intent of the guilty party . and yes prior to her death ( assumming all other requirements were met ) she could have <allcaps> at her choice </allcaps> and un - <allcaps> coerced </allcaps> have chosen to abort the fetus without incurring a legal penalty . but that would of course be much different .	0
in least they all should be sterilized , they are useless . wow what an awkward discussion . there is obviously no reason to sterilize when they are sexually retarded as opposed to mentally retarded and even then mentally retarded can have non mentally retarded children and some of them are able to take care of their offspring depending up the severity of their condition .	0
we have got approximately 30,000 gun laws in this country as it is . most of them that would put dangerous individuals away for a long time are never used . so we are not in the mood to discuss future restrictions that will not be used either . not in the mood ? oh i see because they restrict you already your not in the mood to remove the regulations that do not work and insert proper ones that do . excellent ignore the issue at hand and give no suggestion to improve upon the current laws and restrictions . <repeated>	1
well it all depends on who is going to determine " right " , is not it ? abortion is not math . there are no finite answers . just a myriad of opinions which inevitable lead to either abortion is right or abortion is wrong . no different now then when roe v wade became law or any other times in history . i do like aristotle ' s take ; he taught that a fetus originally had a vegetable soul but he did not say what kind of vegetable . i do not understand why people are stuck in this mindset that we have to define <allcaps> all </allcaps> abortions as either right or wrong . in between , there is the option of calling abortion under certain circumstances as right or wrong or calling abortion in certain trimesters as right or wrong . why limit yourself to the extreme views ? i do not believe that the original post asked for an absolute answer , just a survey of opinions . after all , as you say , abortion is not math and there is no one answer that everyone might agree with . however , the question of people ' s opinions on the beginning of personhood and how it relates to the morality of abortion lies at the very core of the debate on abortion rights . really . <repeated> what other question is more relevant ?	0
[ quote = toby ] [ quote ] the relative context , in this instance , is understood to be the assertion that a moral consensus is limited by a shifting perspective - i . e . changing from time to time and from place to place , etc . a radical relativist might say that ' s what attila should do - even assuming you have some heinous behaviour in mind : i am not . it might be argued that moral sentiments are instinctive . i am not going quite that distance : i am saying that moral values are expressions of approval / disapproval that do not arise from rational deliberation , but from the affective part of human nature . fine . thank you . what im hearing is that you believe attila should act in accordance with the prevailing moral consensus . how do you define the moral consensus ? in attilas case , would that be among the huns ? among the hun ruling elite ? or should attila act in accordance with a wider consensus of which he ( for the sake of argument ) has no intimate knowledge ? now why should he act in accordance with the consensus ? this is not completely clear to me . so , do you take the position that moral sentiments are learned ?	0
heading further down that path . <repeated> if the " right " belongs to the child , then the " right " obviously also <allcaps> does not </allcaps> belong to those opposed to gays . more specifically , the " right " to <allcaps> waive </allcaps> potential parents as ineligible does not belong to those who are opposed to gays . the " right " would belong to the child to decide who he / <allcaps> she </allcaps> wants , and it would be a bigger usurpment of this right of the child to <allcaps> deny </allcaps> the child the option of gay parents than it is to present him with the option . well , this gets rather complicated . a very young child does not get to choose his or her adoptive parents . who decides on who adopts whom depends on the kind of adoption and the policies of the particular adoption system . in private domestic adoption , the birth mother usually gets to decide on who will adopt her baby . the foster care system is organized differently , and international adoption is different still and depends on the country from which the child is being adopted . so it ' s pretty much impossible to generalize about adoption policies and practices . they vary greatly . the point is that the purpose of adoption is to protect the rights of the child .	0
3 ) of course if you throw out morality as a basis for law , there ' s no reason , other than economics , to not allow gay marriage . well good at least you are aware there is no reason beyond your opinion of morality against gay marriage . so by all means do not marry a man and the problem is solved .	1
murder without pain is still murder . if you pour co2 into a babies room while their sleeping they probably will not feel anything . biologically the fetus is an individual human organism from conception , i do not think it ' s about consciousness or awareness because a newborn probably is not aware of much , it ' s all really conjecture what they understand , and none of us remember . it ' s the principle , not whether the organism is sentient at that exact moment , but whether it as a category ( species ) is sentient . a sleeping person does not lose their rights because they can not pass the mirror test unconscious . i would argue against this but i would need to introduce subjectivism into the argument . lolemoticonxcensored	1

it means life is holistic , not reductionist . life , as is the genome , is a system - - an irreducibly complex system - - not an assortment of pieces that just happen to be fitted together over time via random genetic changes culled by nonrandom death . no it means that the genome operates in a more complex way than was previously believed . it does not mean that " life is irreducibly complex " since that term is not even sufficiently well defined to test the assertion . and given the scattering of information into many pieces i would say that more and more it looks like " pieces that happen to be fitted together " . more and more like a complex kludge . exactly what one might expect to find in an evolved system rather than a designed or deliberate or intentional one !	0
let me get this straight . we can not force a woman to give birth if she does not want the child , but we can force the father to pay for the child ' s care regardless of whether he wanted the child or not ? interesting . yes because it is " officially " a life . whether a person believes in life at conception or not they all agree it is life at birth and half way through life it is still life and right before death it is still life . if she does not want the child she can refrain from sex , use a contraceptive or abortion . if he does not want it he can refrain from sex ( not likely for men ) , use a condom ( not a guarantee to work ) , have surgery ( hard to reverse ) but that is it . so if he was to use a condom and get her pregnant she still has the last option .	0

cute , but not quite . the claim is that we want everybody to have guns . so i ' d like to see some proof that gun owners have called for the repealing of the federal age limit that covers the purchase of firearms , and for the prohibited persons list that keeps felons , the insane , the drug addicted , and those that beat their wives , from legally buying guns . if those of my chosen party have made the claims that we want criminals , terrorists and the others in these categories to have guns , then i ' d like to see them . otherwise the claim that we want everybody armed is nothing more than a lie . the private property of whom ? we have security stops along the mexican / american border to search for drugs and other contraband . how is it not possible on the way to and from dc ? simple answer ? dc has a lot less budget than the usa government . more complex answer ? just looking at the commuters , there are over 400,000 people that come to work in dc every day ( see link in my last post ) . making the preposterous assumption that they all come in at a constant flow , just looking at 400,000 of them and assuming that you would only check them coming in , that ' s ~ 4.6 people admitted per second for every second of the working week . good luck with that . good luck with convincing people that it ' s constitutional , as well - airports get away with it , but only because there is such a ( largely unfounded ) fear of death by terrorist that they can get away with something which is constitutionally shady . a quick search gave me two relevant results almost immediately .	0
saw a great article today by michael bloomberg ( yes , that michael bloomberg ) , about where the illegal guns used in crimes come from - mainly from the states with weak gun control laws . this is unsurprising to most rational folk , but yet we still hear the pro - gun clarion call to have no new gun laws , etc . so here ' s the article for all to read : stop spread of illegal guns from states with weak laws - cnn . com it is silly to focus on the tools and not bad people who misuse these tools , especially when the tools in question can be easily smuggled as well as made in a modestly - equipped machine shop . also , why do many of those who supposedly have a political orientation that favors freedom and opposes tyranny want to severely and arbitrarily limit the rights of tens of millions of people who have not , and show no indication of wanting to , unjustly hurt anyone with these tools ? it is wrong to tell people that they cannot put certain substances in their bodies and have abortions , just as it is wrong to tell people that they cannot have certain precision - machined metal / polymer / wood objects in their own homes .	0

other apes can also be taught these same concepts - to a more limited degree , sure , but then the related parts of their brain are smaller and less capable . yes peeling ; you say this with such assurance , yet what you can not explain with any assurance is why only one offshoot of the primate genus evolved into what human beings are today . why only us , when we all allegedly started in the same environment with the same ecosystems putting the same pressures on us . what i am saying is that in every place where our alleged primate ancestors fossils have been found , so have not the fossils of animals described as lower primates been found . so your explanation that one species evolved while another stagnated or died out rings hollow with me . especially since you can actually prove absolutely none of this . can not you see that peeling ? none of this is provable .	0

according to the old testament , sodom and gammorah were destroyed because the rich oppressed the poor ( which is nearly an essential part of capitalism ) , not because of homosexuality . according to the old testament , you must also murder people of different faiths in cold blood by stoning them to death , especially your friends and family . well , those who keep using that story can not see the real sins of those cities . they are so sure that it was rampent homosexuality which lead to their destruction . even though we know that before the angels were ever sent god had spelled out why he was going to destroy them . he sent the angels because they promiced to find even one righteous man . they failed in that because the angels were attacked for being foreigners . noone who abuses this story is ever going to admit this fact . they can not see past the supposed homosexual issue .	0
. <repeated> yet the types of mutations that are required for cumulative selection have never been observed . what ' s " cumulative selection ?

the question was about whales . pay attention will you ? you are right ; i did not type anything in at all . i just asked huntard to prove his claim . but in response to your propaganda piece , here ' s some opposing evidence . the third problem , ' as zimmer acknowledges ' , is that there aren ’ t very many early whale fossils . does that surprise you ? evolutionists have probably led you to believe that the fossil evidence for whale evolution is , pardon the expression , rock - solid . but there isn ’ t really that much ' hard ' evidence . whale evolution is mostly imaginary , or speculative at best . since whales are mammals , evolutionists imagined that a land - going mammal must have returned to the sea . at first , they imagined this without any fossil evidence . so , they went looking for fossils to support their preconceived ideas . the first hint that they were probably right came in 1983 , when researcher phil gingerich found a 52 - million year old skull in shallow deposits in pakistan . although fragmentary , the skull had teeth that were nearly identical with those of mesonychids and the archaeocetes . … despite the whale - like characteristics of the skull , however , pakicetus lacked two important adaptations which are present in modern whales . in living whales , the ears contain large sinuses that can be filled with blood , allowing the animal to maintain pressure while diving . modern whales also transmit sound vibrations to the inner ear using a ' fat pad ' , which allows them to hear directionally underwater . pakicetus lacked both of these features , indicating that it was unable to dive deeply and that it could not hear well underwater . these anatomical clues meshed well with its habitat , since the pakicetus bones were found in deposits that had been laid down at the mouth of a river on the shore of a shallow sea , where the opportunities for deep diving would be limited . although no post - cranial bones of pakicetus were found , it seemed logical to assume , from the teeth and ear structure , that the animal spent a great deal of time in shallow water looking for food , but returned to the land to rest , somewhat like a modern sea lion . … the earliest known cetacean , pakicetus , demonstrates a mixture of traits which are unique to the terrestrial mesonychids as well as marine whales , and indicates that the cetaceans are descended from the mesonychid carnivores . although we have not found any post - cranial bones from pakicetus yet , . <repeated> 5 consider what this evolutionist has just told us . first , they haven ’ t found any post - cranial bones of pakicetus . [ since this essay was written , they have found some post - cranial bones . ] post - cranial bones are bones below the skull . so , all they have found is a skull . they don ’ t have a single pakicetus rib . they don ’ t have any pakicetus vertebrae . no other bones of any kind . just a skull - - and a fragmentary one at that . why do they think it came from a whale ancestor ? because its teeth look like whale teeth . but when they look at the ear bones , there is nothing to indicate that it could hear underwater . the skull was found in association with other fossils that lived on the bank of a river or along the sea shore . yet it “ demonstrates a mixture of traits which are unique to the terrestrial mesonychids as well as marine whales , and indicates that the cetaceans [ whales ] are descended from the mesonychid carnivores . ” in a whale of trouble so the claim is made based only on the teeth because no other evidence supports such a conclusion . that ' s real complete and reliable information that justifies making such an absolute claim from . not ! <repeated> emoticonxdonno only some ? what ' s this then : hxxp :// en . wikipedia . org / wiki / image : pakicetus_ ( 1 ) . jpg replace the xx with tt in case you are wondering why i put the link up like that , it ' s the stupid post count thingy .	1

he found that adaptive genetic mutations arising systematically under these circumstances outnumbered maladaptive and inconsequential mutations to a high degree , statistically speaking . a most significant finding , and one that has been repeated again and again and again , to the point where somatic hypermutation is accepted by bacteriologists as a legitimate ' immune response ' enabling rapid adaptive [ <allcaps> eam </allcaps> ] evolution [ antibiotic resistance ] in eusocial bacteria . would you mind telling us just how he determined <allcaps> all </allcaps> maladaptive or inconsequential mutations in his test organism and just how he validated such measurements ? to me as a biologist with quite a bit of microbiology under the belt it would seem to be impossible to do so ! after all its very likely that a fairly large portion of the populutaion will have at least one mutation at at least one base pair location in the total sequence ! your claim would seem to be impossible , but perhaps there is a way he managed to do so .	0

wrong . my gasoline prices vary from day to day ( especially so , lately ) but the retail price of electricity only varies with pronouncements from my state public service commission . the investment capital is available , but ill - considered regulations ( particularly those speciously based on the endangered species act ) and nuisance lawsuits from the environmental groups make it impossible to employ that capital . for example , we have not built a new refinery in almost 30 years although people are using more gasoline than ever ; a group in arizona has been trying since 1999 to get the necessary permits for another refinery , but they have not yet been successful . you are changing the subject . i referred to societal compassion , not government compassion ( which i agree is nearly nonexistent - see the canadian health care system for an awful example of where that leads ) . they are going to say no ? ca tried that . tell me the last time utility costs were reduced by a state agency . it ' s a rubber stamp and nothing else . we travel in different investment circles . i do not know anyone putting their money in us long - term syndication on the equity side not associated with health care real property and a petrochemical plant can be a 40 - year useful life situation . what ' s your take on the us economy in 5 , 10 and 20 + years ? good enough to put up the money for what may well be surplus refining capacity before useful life term is reached ? enviros or not , if the return is there money always has its own way of doing things . corporations are awash in cash . liquidity has been the name of the game for some time , but there are always bridge buyers .	0
what do you see as the major flaw of the view opposite of your in regards to how abortion should be dealt with ? like i said in another thread , the argument i hear most often from so - called ' pro - choicers ' is that you cannot legislate morality . well then what can you legislate ? every law in existence is legislation of morality ! by that way of thinking , then we should have no laws . if someone kidnaps and murders your 3 - year - old child , then let us hope the murderer goes free because we cannot legislate morality !	1

just thought i ' d share about secular rights for gays . <repeated> not " special rights " but equal rights . <repeated> no , homosexuals do not have the same rights as heterosexuals do . we cannot serve in the military because of our sexual orientation . we do not all have protections against being fired because of our sexual orientation . as for the secular rights , i do not think this is right . from a religious standpoint , i have never seen more ignorance , hatred or twisted lies put into words as i have on this board from some of the folks who are christians . personally , i do not see the difference between what is " good " and what is " evil " when it comes to religion on here . i have seen satanists say nicer things than what has been written here . if this is your idea of what is good , i want no part of it . as far as the two , secular rights and religious rights , it seems that although the constitution has a freedom of religion clause in it , faith based people cannot and will not separate the two out making the separation clause invalid . <repeated> what ' s the point in that ? i think they are doing it out of fear . they see the moral decline in america and they have latched onto the <allcaps> glbt </allcaps> community as their scapegoat . since it ' s no longer pc to attack african - americans for their obvious differences , it ' s not pc to go after other religions ( especially judaism - not that it actually stops pure hate groups from doing it ) they have decided that attacking a group of people which are sexually different should be the way to go . i mean , their religion tells them that premarital sex is bad and wrong . even though there is a multi - billion dollar industry based around <allcaps> heterosexual </allcaps> sex , they actually depend on that money too much to bite the hand that feeds them . insted , they attack a group that has not legal rights to marriage let alone little legal standing as far as individual rights . it ' s easier that way .	0

from my memory your medical references both showed the trend you state , but they were also limited in geography and sample ( two cities ) , and provided no casue and effect , merely a curious relationship in the numbers . well let us deal with one thing at a time . the <allcaps> nejm </allcaps> study about washington d.c. concluded that banning handguns saved 47 lives each year . the study did not conclude that it was just a " curious relationship in the numbers . " go back to that thread and read the study . if you are looking for evidence that is absolutely without any degree of uncertainty then you will not find it . you can not prove things to a 100% certainty with statistics . what you can do is show what is probably true and what is probably not true . even in court you are not expected to prove that someone is guilty to a 100% certainty . you are expected to prove that they are guilty beyond a reasonable doubt .	0

an evolutionary mutation of a gene is : a new and useful gene that never b4 existed , bring new body structures and functions that never b4 existed . actually , there is no such thing as " an evolutionary mutation of a gene . " a mutation is a mutation . for evolution to have occurred requires neither that a mutation be new nor useful and they do not require new structures nor structures . here ' s a little mental exercise for you . at most , a person can have only two alleles for any gene . this would have been the condition of the human race 6,000 years ago according to creationists . it would not have been possible for there to be more than 2 alleles for any given gene . now consider that for every gene in the human genome there is an average of 14 different alleles , sometimes more , sometimes less . where did all of those alleles come from ?	0

intellegent design is the study of the idea that certain biological phenomena are too complex to have been evolved from a series of simpler organisms , and therefore must have been created fully functional from the onset . it is based on the idea that if we can observe an organism or an organic function whose existence cannot be explained by the successive adaptation of the evolutionary model , then that organism or function is evidence for intelligent design . when intelligent design first emerged , among the long list of examples of irreducibly complex phenomena were the eye , the flagellum and blood clotting . all of these have been shown to have simpler counterparts which also fucntion , and therefore which could have been the evolutionary basis for the emergence of these more complex functions . these examples are summarized in wikipedia ' s article irreducible complexity - wikipedia , the free encyclopedia yes i know , a lot of people have done a lot of work to try to refute behe ' s work . from your link ;	0

lack of a natural mechanism . charles darwin , in his origin of species , proposed natural selection to be the mechanism by which an original simple - celled organism could have evolved gradually into all species observed today , both plant and animal . darwin defines evolution as " descent with modification . " however , natural selection is known to be a conservative process , not a means of developing complexity from simplicity . later , with our increased understanding of genetics , it was thought perhaps natural selection in conjunction with genetic mutation allowed for the development of all species from a common ancestor . however , this is theoretical and controversial , since " beneficial " mutations have yet to be observed . in fact , scientists have only observed harmful , " downward " mutations thus far . time constraints . both creationists and evolutionists agree that if evolution is at all possible , there needs to be an excessive ( if not infinite ) amount of time . for much of the 2 0 th century , it was thought evolutionists had all the time they needed . if the earth ever looked too young for certain evolutionary developments to have occurred , the age was pushed back in the textbooks . in 1905 , the earth was declared to be two billion years old . by 1970 , the earth was determined to be 3.5 billion years old , and by the 1990 ' s , the earth had become 4.6 billion years old . however , young earth advocates have identified quite a few young earth chronometers in recent years . currently , there are approximately five times more natural chronometers indicating a " young earth " than an " old earth . " each discovery is a separate " limiting factor " that places a constraint on the possible age of the earth . for example , moon drift , earth rotation speed , magnetic field decay , erosion rates , chemical influx into the oceans , ocean salinity , etc , all constrain the possible age of the earth . each limiting factor is distinct . if one were successfully challenged , there is still the problem of all the rest . furthermore , there are limiting factors constraining the possible age of the universe , such as spiral galaxies where they are maintaining their spiral shapes despite their centers spinning faster than their extremities . you are incorrect when it comes to the age of the earth . all inidciation by all branches of science indicate an earth that is over 3 billion years old . ( aside from the lies of the young earth creationism . each and every one of those ' indications ' are based on misunderstandings and out right lies aboutscience . a discussion about the various methods ( and where the <allcaps> yec </allcaps> claims go wrong can be found at <url>	0

of those that are beneficial , the chance of actually being passed on is minimal considering the animal bearing that mutation has to actually be the biggest strongest animal to pass on its genes - unless it is lucky . no it does not . that ' s why darwin objected to the use of that phrase in reference to his theory . those who do not bother to learn the theory tend to misunderstand . fittness is not a reference to big and strong . it makes it too easy to misrepresent evolutionary theory . i will state it again since you seem to have missed or ignored it the first time . natural selection is differential reproductive success . those organisms that are well adapted to their environment tend to survive to reproduce in greater numbers , and therefore they tend to leave more offspring , than those organisms that are less well adapted . you have got to be a pretty shallow thinker to equate an environmental advantage with big and strong .	0

yeah , that ' s generally the conclusion that i come to which is why i see nothing wrong with abortion . i am probably not going to be killed by abortion any time soon . here we go dan . your problem with the law is not whether its fair or not , its whether you can benefit personally from it . you have no problem with abortion because your not going to be the victim of such a law , but youd definitely have a problem if you were the one suffering from the law . apparently you dont care if the law disadvantages or is unfair to others , as long as it does not hurt you , you are ok with it .	0

this statement is wrong . people from hundreds of years before jesus was born prophesied that a baby would be born , in bethlehem , of a virgin . there were over 50 more prophesies that were made about his life , and the sacrafice he made to pay for the sins of man , and the bigest one of all . <repeated> he completely fufilled scripture when he rose from the dead . these men were inspired by jesus , god , how can you argue that he is not the christ ? the odds of one man filling all the prophesies is impossible . and these scriptures have been unchanged for the past 2000 - 2500 approx years ! thats proof for me that jesus existed and that he is god . pm me if you like . the egyptians predicted his birth , death , <allcaps> wwi </allcaps> , <allcaps> wwii </allcaps> , and they have predict the supposed end of the world . are you saying that this religion was wrong ? they predicted a lot more that i have not put that have come true .	0

from national health service greater glasgow & clyde women & childrens directorate - social gynaecology patient information complications of termination psychological effects : a small number of women experience regret or adverse psychological effects . few experience any long - term , adverse psychological effects . early distress is common and usually a continuation of symptons present before the abortion . however , long - lasting , negative effects on both mothers and their children are reported where abortion has been denied . so , it ' s a proven fact that children denied the act of abortion suffer negative effects ? hmm <elongated>	1

umm . <repeated> thats the point of saying god of the gaps - when science fills in the gaps then there is less for your god to do . this is just pure intentional ignorance - you do realise peddlar , that things can happen over time ? not to mention that evolutionary hypothesis have been made and then tested - protein homology for one , there is no way anyone knew the answer before hand but what was observed later when technology improved is what was expected . <allcaps> dna </allcaps> dating pretty much gives the same time for common ancestors as fossils do . there is really no difference between carrying out an experiment a fraction of a second in the past and observing it than millions of years - other than the latter makes it a little difficult to get all the evidence sometime . science is the current sum of human knowledge about how the world works . never get published thoughthere is a massive amount of evidence that points to things being designed via evolution rather than a concious designer - there are massive amount of badly designed organs and organisms , either god is spiteful or incompetant . lets not go into the parasitic wasps and hyperparasitic wasps which are what made darwin convert ( or part of it ) . he could not beleive that a kind benevolent creator would design such horrors intentionally . having something ' s larvae consume your organs whilst still alive and feeding of another catapilar ' s guts whilst still inside them strikes you as a kind and good thing to do ? mayabe this is a miniscule amount of suffering compared to what awaits you on the flipside . weather it be an eternity of bliss or agony and suffering . who really knows . mayabe those who have this happen to them have it coming to them ?	0

one other point : say that the laws of physics ( which are derived from mutual human experience ) are wrong but just appear to be right and that some omnipotent being can change them whenever he likes . if these apparent laws have remained the same for all of recorded human time , then why should we suspect that they may change at any moment ? it all comes down to probability - if things are not what we expect they are from science , then that should have manifested itself by now . i am not claiming any omnipotent deciever . i am not sure where you derive ' probability ' from , or how you can have any degree of certainty over your past experiences or those of other consciousnesses . and in any case , saying ' it has not happened yet ' is hardly logical proof .	0
the enumeration in the constitution , of certain rights , shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people . rights retained by the peopleaside from contending that a bill of rights was unnecessary , the federalists responded to those opposing ratification of the constitution because of the lack of a declaration of fundamental rights by arguing that inasmuch as it would be impossible to list all rights it would be dangerous to list some because there would be those who would seize on the absence of the omitted rights to assert that government was unrestrained as to those . 1 madison adverted to this argument in presenting his proposed amendments to the house of representatives . ' ' it has been objected also against a bill of rights , that , by enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power , it would disparage those rights which were not placed in that enumeration ; and it might follow by implication , that those rights which were not singled out , were intended to be assigned into the hands of the general government , and were consequently insecure . this is one of the most plausible arguments i have ever heard against the admission of a bill of rights into this system ; but , i conceive , that it may be guarded against . i have attempted it , as gentlemen may see by turning to the last clause of the fourth resolution . ' ' 2 it is clear from its text and from madison ' s statement that the amendment states but a rule of construction , making clear that a bill of rights might not by implication be taken to increase the powers of the national government in areas not enumerated , and that it does not contain within itself any guarantee of a right or a proscription of an infringement . 3 recently , however , the amendment has been construed to be positive affirmation of the existence of rights which are not enumerated but which are nonetheless protected by other provisions . the purpose of the bill of rights . preamble to the bill of rights	0

i went about this wrong . i am meaning that it would take millions of years for wings to evolve . during these millions of years , they will be undeveloped , simply masses attached to the dinosaur , and totally useless . when they reach their fully evolved form , they may have been of use , but until then , they could serve no purpose , and help the dino in no way at all , serving only as excess weight , and larger profile , hindering survival by not allowing particularly good hiding or movement . during the actual period of the wings evolution , they would be totally useless . and yet this is what they fossil record shows . there is alot of information floating around on the uses of feathers for insulation , hunting techniques , display etc before flight . half a feather might not be as good for flight as a " fully developed " one , but dinosaurs had them and they probably were able to glide , albeit poorly , with them . even less of a feather might shade a pool of water to allow them to spot small fish or for display to attract a potential mate . to say they were " totally useless " , is simply false . evolution works on adapting already functional structures for different functions .	0
i believe dametel is referring to leviticus 20:13 - ' if a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman , both of them have done what is detestable . they must be put to death ; their blood will be on their own heads .

i would say that if a diety can not go out of his way to demonstrate his existance and make clear what he wants this may surprise you , although we cannot observe not test this , god has come down to earth many times throughout human history . your reason for believing this lies entirely within the bible . i hardly consider a 1500 year old book " making clear what he wants " . particularly given that even among those who believe the book , they still can not agree on what god wants . and of course , that does not even beging to address the issue of all the other holy books which contradict the christian bible . you may personally believe that you know what god wants , but if so it ' s not because god has been clear about it .	0

most evolutionists believe that matter and time were created by a " big bang .

the car crash analogy only goes so far . the consequence of a car crash is merely damaged property . not all unwanted pregnancies are due to unprotected sex or irresponsibility , contraception can fail . humans are sexual beings , they have sex ( something some posters may understand some day if he ever have sex ) and pregnancy can occur despite the best of precautions . the puritan expects everyone to be celibate until marriage . not all people get married . also , unwanted pregnancies also occur within marriage . i totally understand the concept of being responsible , but the consequences of a pregnancy or an unwanted child can be devastating to a woman or a couple . it is naive , simplistic and yes , punitive , to simply conclude that the woman should ' face the consequences . ' sure , no doubt . but , there are ways to be absolutely 100% sure that you do not get pregnant . the obvious way is not to have sex , but i know you will not settle for abstinance as an answer . that ' s way too religious for this site i suppose . obviously i cannot propose that no one have sex unless they want children . if someone does not want to ever have children and is willing to undergo an operation ( abortion ) to remove the possibility , why can they not simply have a different operation before practicing casual sex ? this is true within marriage as well .	0

' he was a partial - birth abortion provider that killed babies late term . in terms of fetal viability he might as well been killing babies right after they ' d been born . i do not condone it , but i am surprised it did not happen sooner - - one monster killed by another . it wasn ' t right , but what that sicko doctor was doing was certainly no better .	0

humans attempt to create new species , such as breeding donkey with horses to get mules and lions with tigers to get ligers , but these " <allcaps> new </allcaps> " species are almost always born sterile and unable to perpetuate themselves . actually , breeding horses and donkeys is not an effort to create a new species . where did you get such a thoughtless idea . and neither is interbreeding lions and tigers . however , you do not seem to be aware that neither ligers or tigons are sterile . they are capable of breeding with each other or with either of the parent species . and then there are polar bears and brown bears , which can and will interbreed if given the opportunity . and the offspring are perfectly fertile .	1

no , you are mixed up . you see , superman is a fictional comic book character who was created by jerry siegel and joe schuster back in the 3 0 s . jesus is the true messiah of humanity who in fact did save the world from spiritual darkness . he defeated death and even travelled in ways that defied the laws of physics after being crucified and presumed dead by his murderers . jesus christ is the real superman . any powers you attribute to the fictional character superman , you can accurately attribute to jesus and you wont find him wanting . i am a real fan of superman , but i love , worship and trust my eternal life to jesus christ . with that said , i am calling it a night and have no desire to help you continue to mock the lord . wow archie , way to suck the fun out of something . let me use your words here :	1
all of the british papers keep going on about how bad it is , how more people than ever are being gunned down in the streets , how guns are being imported into britain and resold through underground channels , how criminals employ young women to act as gun mules for transporting and storage , etc . now who should we believe more , your or the papers that relate the news to us ? is that a trick question ? no , the tabloid and other gutter press keep going on about how bad it is , because they sell papers by fanning fear and hatred , and fear of crime is one of their biggest markets . yes there has been an increase in gun crime over the years , but that ' s largely attributable to increased attractiveness of crime in a society where social mobility has come to a standstill . in any case the number of incidents where firearms are used in crime is still very small , which is why every time someone gets shot it is headline news . guns are incredibly rare in this country , the only time i have seen guns in real life ( other than air rifles ) is on a military base .	0
it ' s a false dichotomy that some critics of religion have cast religion in by saying that submitting to spiritual authority and thinking / reasoning are going to be juxtaposed . yes . it ' s not logical to simply cite , " the bible tells me so , the bible was written by god , " and consider that an argument . the bible has been wrong . it ' s also not logical to cite authority to god . it necessarily begs further questions about your god ' s unproven existence to those who do not believe in that god , or in any god . if we do not simply believe in your god , on the basis of your presupposition , he can have no authority over the rest of us . one must come up with another argument . should each religion have it ' s own definition or completely different idea of logic , which favours that religion and its god ?	0

hello everyone , i am a high school student seeking help . me and my partner are about to enter a debate on firearms , and we already know that we are for guns . can you all just tell me if you are for guns or not and a short reason why ? thank you . well if you already know you are for guns , then you should know the basic reasons , right ? or was this an uninformed decisions ( i heard from my friend that guns are good ) ? but basically other people have said it . they are protected by the constitution , they generally result in lower crime rates , and they can be used for defense as well as hunting . oh , but the burden of proof is not on the people supporting guns , but those who wish to ban guns . most arguments for banning guns are easily refutable .	1

2 . preventing a poor / unhappy life , 2 . you have no idea whether the unborn will be ' unhappy ' , or even poor , for their lifetime . it would be more sensible to evaluate a person ' s life at , age 10 perhaps , and then kill them if they have been unhappy and are likey to continue . again , anyone on welfare is a likely target . in fact , it might be expedient to simply nuke the poorest parts of the world . if the child is to be born into a poverty stricken part of the world and is expected to die by the age of 7 by either disease or lack of food , why not spare pain and abort ?	0

put a fork in it . socialized medicine is <allcaps> doa </allcaps> . the possible scenarios that could get the healthcare bill made into law are both suicidal moves that will cause the democrats to become washington outsiders in quick order . they are : 1 . get the hr to pass the senate bill without any changes . this will be suicidal to the most liberal democrats and the most conservative ones , because the senate bill is a neutered version of the house bill . 2 . they drag their feet on certifying brown until after the reconsiliation process occurs so that they maintain their supermajority . this option is ever worse than option 1 because it exposes every democrat in congress for the unprincipled b @ #$ % rds that they are and will cause a firestorm against them for years to come . if there ' s one lesson that crooked politicians should have learned by now , it ' s the lesson of watergate . the people have long memories when it comes to blatant attempts to throw elections . so you are saying that the democrats have no choice but to inaugarate brown and let him stop the bill ? you suggest that whatever option they pick will be political suicide .	0

if we were created in god ' s image , then it would make sense that equally our emotions are a reflection of god ' s emotions . that our emotions are imperfect versions of his . of course i would personally say that when man invented god , they felt the need to give him human characteristics in order to make their invention more understandable . and to assist in the oppression of others by the ever - present threat of an ' angry god who will smite you ' . an ' ambivalent god who is above that sort of thing ' just is not as good at convincing people that whatever you say is right . man cannot invent anything that did not already exist in form . did we invent the wheel , or discover the idea ? did the wright brothers invent machine powered flight , or was it that they stumbled upon it ? in every culture , in every society , man looks to something greater than himself . they simple do not leave it at themselves and be done with it .	1

your analysis might be correct , although i do not think i ' d bet big money on it . in particular , i am not sure about your conclusion here : " the legislature is required to consider constitutional amendments in a joint session until final action is taken . " my reading is simply that if they do not reach a conclustion in one session , they have to take it up again in the next one . if it ' s going to pass , it has to pass in two consecutive years , so simply taking it up in year three and saying , " did not pass in two consecutive years , failed " may be legit . i think this is a fair conclusion . i went as far as i did because of what it seems to say about the governor calling for a joint session . i may be wrong , but the text seems to instruct the governor to keep them in joint session until final action is taken . in other words , it does not appear that the governor has an option . and it does not seem that the constitution allows for a legislative session that never ends . i am not sure how else to square the two except that the legislature should pursue final action . of course , as you have pointed out , it really is hard to speculate on this one without any historical context of the amended amendment process , and / or the relevant legal precedent surrounding it . any thoughts on this ?	0

i was just wanting to make sure it was in the new testiment . my reason for this is you said . <repeated> if the verse were from the old testiment , it would not matter that jesus can come in and perfect one ' s heart because they did not know who jesus was . that ' s really all . but it does not really matter since that ' s not really the main point of your post . i am kind of amused by the idea that the king james version is the most accurate , there are a lot of fairly well documented flaws , like the introduction of unicorns into the old testament . you also seem to imply that modern translations were dreamed up by a couple of drunken biblical scholars with nothing better to do on a friday evening , whereas most are at least as rigorously researched as the kjv , and often with a greater number of sources available .	0

and what a terrible threat those damn socialists have been . emoticonxrolleyes it ' s sad that so many americans still refuse to see that the greatest threat this country faces is itself . oh , yea . you are damn right those european socialists are dangerous . americans might look and see their governments actually doing something <allcaps> useful </allcaps> for the people and think that we should have that here . i am surprised we have not nuked them yet .	1
oh and by the way i agree with benjamin . god is good all the time and in the end god will win meaning creation beats evolution every time . * i wonder how much i would get paid to make up another idea for evolution and convince people its ture . like peas evolved from acorns or something . * then why does not he answer prayers like he says he will in the bible ? so is jesus , aka god , a liar ? or was not even one of the millions of believers who prayed for terri schiavo ' s life to be saved really god ' s child ? gee , i wonder how many people out there are being led by a pastor , priest , or what have you , that prayed but god did not listen because that religious leader is a fraud ? hmm <elongated> , maybe the rape or molestation of young boys , adulty , and so on , by religious leaders is more widespread than anyone could have imagined ? ! <repeated>	0
or perhaps you meant things like inheritance rights , ss survivors benefits , hospital visitation , immigration status , adoption , housing , employment , etc . , etc . , etc . <repeated> . <repeated> i guess those are all " straight things " too ? no , everyone should have those regardless of marriage . you are the one here who seems to think straight and gay marriage should be a litmus test for those things .	0
how can you think that a baby that is not born yet a nonentity ? yeah im only 15 and yet i know that what " abortionist ' s " say is a load of * * * * ! <repeated> i feel sorry for you when i get older because im determined with all my heart to stop abortion ! i believe god put me on this earth to stop you people from killing his creation ! hear my words i hate liberals and i will never change my mind about abortion . i try to love everyone but it ' s hard for me to love somebody who kills an innocent child . i am pro life ! so you are pro - life and you hate liberals ? actually republicans are being liberal in this case ( liberal = bigger government , more laws ) . but i will assume you mean democrats on this . what if the baby is a democrat ? if it ' s a democratic parent it ' s most likely it will grow up democratic and one more person to attempt to keep abortion legal .	1
if you were trying to use that to counter my point , it failed . anecdotal evidence does not affect statistical probability - that there was a single event says nothing about which is generally better . and yet the post - dunblane handgun ban happened after only one event .	1
yea the legalizatioin of drugs would cause an epedimic of problems . crime , suicide , mental health problems , and physical health problems . too late , drug usage has already created those epidemics . legalizing drugs may increase some of them temporarily , but they already exist . i would argue that there would be a decrease in crime , for certain .	0
yet mine is right . <repeated> well it is not really mine , it is the majorities . ok , fine , you can use that line , but there is also a moajority that believes in other things . there ' s this crazy thing , called a choice . we all have that . remember ? i made the choice to have sex , you are making the choice to be a total * * * hole . we all make a decision , and its the strong ones that stick with them , even though there are others who dont believe the same thing .	1
gravity is a fact because we can observe it ' s effects on objects and we can do tests to determine more about it . and some of those tests fail . there are holes in the theory of gravity . yet gravity remains fact in simple every day terms . evolution is fact because " we can observe it ' s effects on objects and we can do tests to determine more about it " . further there are very few holes in that theory . evolution is therefore more deserving of being called fact than gravity is . what i think you are really trying to say is that you can think you understand gravity ( drop ball ; ball falls ) therefore you see it as a fact . but evolution is complex even at a basic level , so you do not see it as fact .	0

lol , when did moore do anything even close to that ? did he change anybody ' s word to make it as if they said what they really didnt say ? when did mike moore do that ? how about in bowling for columbine when he portrayed chuck heston . here is the scene : 1 ) cut to heston wearing a dark suit . 2 ) cut to crying children outside columbine high school . 3 ) cut to heston saying ' from my cold dead hands .

are you refering to japan or some hypothetical police state ? a little of both . japan is known for allowing its police officers to physically and mentally torture suspects and deny them legal counsel if they determine that such counsel will interfere with their interrogation . suspects are not allowed to read confessions before signing them either . is that what penfold really wants ?	0
true , but it does make evolution a known factor , and the scientific method requires that one prioritise exhausting the explicative power of known factors before inventing new ones . and evolution is exhausted . it can not do anything with origins , and recent discoveries of the complexities of the simplest forms of life exhaust it even more .	0

how do atheists account for the laws of logic in a universe without god ? the laws of logic are conceptual by nature and absolute . being absolute they transcend space and time . they are not the properties of the physical universe ( since they are conceptual ) or of people ( since people contradict each other , which would mean they were not absolute ) . so , how do they account for them ? examples of logical absolutes are : something cannot be itself and not itself at the same time ( law of non contradiction ) . a thing is what it is ( law of identity ) . a statement is either true or false ( law of excluded middle ) . these are simple , absolute logical absolutes . how can absolute , conceptual , abstract laws be derived from a universe of matter , energy and motion ? in other words , how can an atheist with a naturalistic presupposition account for the existence of logical absolutes when logical absolutes are conceptual by nature and not physical , energy , or motion ? try the ( law of common sense ) . if your an ex - atheist , you already know the ( law of relativity ) .	1

truth can be both subjective & objective bryers choclate chip ice cream is the best in the world . true for me , the subject . bryers choclate chip ice cream cures cancer . not true for me or anyone else . objective truth . truth can be found in god . we as humans have a relative idea of what truth is because everyone will not agree on what is truth and what is not . for instance , one might say that europe will regain world power or that america will remain the world power but if everyone does not believe it how true is it ? but universal truth can be considered aboslute such as math . 1 + 1 is 2 , 12 inches equal a foot , etc . the question will remain to be unanswered until god reveals what truth is .	0

it is kind of funny how abortion has to do with a woman ' s body . and yet , if it was left up to the state : congress : women hold 81 , or 15.1% , of the 535 seats in the 1 0 9 th us congress 14 , or 14.0% , of the 100 seats in the senate and 67 , or 15.4% , of the 435 seats in the house of representatives . in addition , three women serve as delegates to the house from guam , the virgin islands and washington , dc . only 15.1% . <repeated> so that means that 276 men ( 51 senate / 225 congress ) will be needed just to pass a law that has to do with a women ' s body . <repeated> and if its something that could be bad for a woman and / or unfairly good for a man then they can get no where near the amount of senators / representatives needed to supress it . <repeated> [ 66.6666 - 15.1 = 51.56666 - - ( 535 / 100 ) ( 51.56666 ) = 276 ] ( <url> i love it when people manipulate statistics in order to attempt to prove a causal relationship that does not exist . considering the fact that more women vote than men , one could argue that their views are over - represented .	1

a free society works by saying " you can not do this stuff but everything else is up to you guys " . if you go around saying " you must do it this way " then you really are not a free society but you have the government controlling instead . i think a free society works better by saying " you have to have at least a certain variety to give your customers a choice in products " . businesses should have the restrictions , not private citizens .	0
the problem with id is that there is no evidence , and it is simply not possible to falsify it . if we were able to prove that our dating procedures were false and that really we stood on 2 legs back when the earth was created and that the fossil record is not really as we thought it was , evolution would be falsified . intelligent design can simply not be falsified because there is no supporting evidence for it . that is the line between religion and science . the problem with happenstance origins is that there is no evidence , and it ' s simply not possible to falsify it . if we were able to prove so many scientific proceedures ( from abiogenesis to radiometric dating - all based on the presupposition that there is no god ) were indisputably true , then id would be falsified . there is not enough supporting evidence for happenstance origins . yet so much of happenstance origins is considered science , so all too often , there is no line between religion and science .	0
i doubt it . a story on the news today . those who have firearms in their homes are more likely to die of murder and are more likely to die from suicide . interesting . sucide ? is not that a mental health issue ? if you take a gun from a sucidal and depressed person , does that cure depression ? if it does that you have addressed the root cause of sucide . if it does not than you really have not done anything to cure the fundamental cause of sucide .	0
whatever you think about what she was intending to do or not - - though she communicated quite clearly - - is rather irrelevant given the offense and those surrounding circumstances . i bet this is your opinion <allcaps> any </allcaps> time the story concerns a black defendent and a white police officer . because you are a racist . more irrational drivel , and have you forgotten that i am an arab ? a smaller minority in this country than blacks ? yet you must play the race card and assume that because i oppose this criminal woman for threatening the life of her unborn child by actually holding her responsible for her own poor conduct that i am somehow a racist . your argument is as pathetic as your character is found wanting , you immoral apologist for all that is wrong with this country .	1
if that ' s the case , then we should alsdo eliminate corporate taxes and only have ' natural persons ' pay taxes since corporations would be taxed without representation . why would you think such an absurd concept . corporations do not cast a vote in an election do they ? why not ? does a corporation have a mind of it ' s own that it may look to it ' s interests in it ' s attempts to influence legislation ? no , it permits individuals to overcome finance laws and exercise greater influence than is normally permitted for an individual . should your car have rights ? you pay a tax for it . how about your house ? pay a tax for that also every year .	1
science is different . in science it ' s a matter of who has the most convincing evidence . if we are to give christianity the benefit of the doubt and allow it to throw its own evidence into the list of candidates , can you <allcaps> honestly </allcaps> tell me that creationsim is the best answer ? if so ( and i extend the challenge i made to lappster ) educate and enlighten us . i am eager ( as always ) to read the evidence for myself . i have posted responses to demon38 ' s earlier post . i have offered <allcaps> dna </allcaps> findings as evidence to begin with . it is not my evidence , but scientific evidence . that is the only evidence that i will provide in this discussion . i think there is ample evidence to cause scientists to rethink their theories , evidence that they do not want to accept because it puts certain hypothesis they have advanced in a poor light .	0

then a man who needs an artificial heart to survive is a new species of man . that is the analogy i gave , and you ignored . in both cases ; human and bacteria , before the advent of a human product , a particular group of individuals from each larger group would die off . i am not trying to participate in gang debate , but well . <repeated> the population of " people with heart trouble " would only be in jeopardy if the heart trouble made it more difficult to reproduce . if reproduction is not hindered then there is much less chance of dying off .	0

it ' s a sin , matthew . and homosexual relations are unnatural , according to scripture . are there other scriptures in the new testament which deal with homosexuality ? yes . romans 1:24 - 27 ; i timothy 1:10 and jude 7 . if one takes these scriptures seriously , homosexuality will be recognized as an evil . the romans passage is unmistakably clear . paul attributes the moral depravity of men and women to their rejection of " the truth of god " ( 1:25 ) . they refused " to retain god in their knowledge " ( 1:28 ) , thereby dethroning god and deifying themselves . the old testament had clearly condemned homosexuality but in paul ' s day there were those persons who rejected its teaching . because of their rejection of god ' s commands he punished their sin by delivering them over to it . your problem is that you take the bible as the literal word of the invisible man which everyone with a brain knows it is <allcaps> not </allcaps> . there are other " sins ' listed in the old testament that you ignore and try to explain away but you know as well as i that jesus did not change the laws . if you want others to live by your false book of fairy tales it would be a good idea for you to read it and follow it yourself first . choosing one or two scriptures and using them to attack people is only making you look foolish .	1

' peer ' does not mean anything because ' peers ' are just people with the same background / bias etc . i notice you did not touch upon nationalist sciences . or for that matter , capitalist science . * you mean ' understanding ' written english . * * i say ' western ' because there are other evolutionary theories - marxist , nazi , feminist etc . thank you , come again .	0
of course men can , do , and should have opinions and feelings about abortion , but to say that your interest is equal to that as a woman is silly . men will never be pregnant , regardless of what laws stand , they impact men very little in any real way . pure conjecture on your part . as a father of three , i have as much vested interest in my kids as my wife has . to suggest otherwise is bs . but , maybe you do not understand that because you have not walked a mile in a father ' s shoes . emoticonxrolleyes	1
there has been . there ' s been a lot of grumbling in congress and among the people more to the right of the scale . by saying he still had support i assumed you meant you thought it was somehow shifting to the democrats . <repeated> my mistaken assumption . there is one major difference between the democratic spending plans and the republican plan ( for this election cycle anyway ) : dems want to repeal the tax cuts , so they have a methodology for paying for all of this . oh , and they have not been too keen on sending men to mars either . and just a quick aside , was it legal to invade iraq ? probably , b / c of the legislation broker cites . but i think he makes a logical leap when he extrapolates ' justified ' from ' legal . ' the calculus used to say this was a ' just ' war is a very dangerous one , and if cross - applied could justify innumerable conflicts ( how many nations can legitmately say that another nation has ' dangerous activities ' that make it pose an ' imminent threat ' ? at the very least , the entire mid - east ( arab / israel ) would explode under that logic ) .	0

i honestly do not care what you believe about my comment but the reality is you were prejudice about it while at the same time claiming i was the prejudice one . it honestly makes me laugh because it was that ironic . the simple fact that i rarely / never use the word ' lifestyle ' for ' gay ' would indicate that i meant something different than ' gay ' . unlike many i use words that i find represent what i try to get across . for those that do not know what the word ' lifestyle ' means i have taken the liberty to post it for you below : the habits , attitudes , tastes , moral standards , economic level , etc . , that together constitute the mode of living of an individual or group . <url> doh , you used the ' l ' word . how dare ye ! ( tsk , tsk ) <tong> do not you know ? you can not use the term ' lifestyle , ' you have to use the description of lifestyle instead . that usually works much better . gotta know the rules to talk with the gay rights folk here , do not ya know ? lol see , if you use the word , they can not stay on topic and so then your use of the ' l ' word becomes the topic . it ' s just too damn distracting for ' em .	1

i have believed that god created everything ' in the beginning ' for as long as i can remember . there was a time in my life where i believed that god created evolution , but after seeing the video , i changed to total creationist . well , it does take some scientific knowledge to understand the evidence for evolution . one does not expect creationists to possess it .	1

the fact is foundit , that creationists and i - ders understand that there are so many unanswerable questions , so we know we can not answer them for certain , because man just does not have the knowledge to discern the truth from the minutia . so we should just say " god did it " , and give up ?	0
eugene volokh • july 29, 2010 11:48 pm friday , the michigan supreme court handed down an interesting case — people v . dupree on this . the case is not novel , and my sense is that the defense is generally recognized : just as what would otherwise be the crime of murder , attempted murder , battery , and the like might be justified if done in defense against an imminent threat , so a felon ’ s taking possession of a gun is justified if done in defense against an imminent threat . ( the defense does not apply to a felon ’ s arming himself against a possible threat of attack at some indefinite future time . ) still , the case struck me as an interesting illustration . thanks to jason c . miller for the pointer . did you slip in it <allcaps> again </allcaps> ? were you led astray by a passage from heller you thought you could use to legitimize gun control , your wet dream ? i submit from many past rulings of the courts that little statement is in error .	1

i would not say one can not be a christian if they support abortion but i find it really hard to understand how one justifies or rectifies it with the bible or their faith . ultimately their are responsible to god for what they believe and how they advise others on what to do in a situation based on that belief . i know that one of the things god <allcaps> hates </allcaps> and there are not many things mentioned in the bible that he hates , one of the things is the shedding of innocent blood . if god <allcaps> hates </allcaps> such a thing then i certainly do not want to support it . i do not know what could be more innocent than an unborn child . i did a bit of research on abortion & the bible a few years ago , here is a collection of what i found - abortion & the bible can we get away from quoting 5 year old posts ? seriously , if you do not take the time to actually read the thread why should i respond to your post ?	0

my challenge has been met ? where ? where ? did i assert that god did it ? please find that quote . trebor is apparently atheistic , and seems to believe that god didnt do it . he offered no substantial argument that god didnt do it . the burden is on trebor ( or whomever takes his position ) to demonstrate that god didnt do it . i dont need to show that god did it ; its trebors apparent position that god didnt do it that is in need of support . nobody has addressed <hashtag> 64 </hashtag> . why is that ? my challenge has been met ? thats a big hoot . if somebody actually wants to argue , they should know what has already been argued , and be prepared answer the arguments presented . if you have no answer to <hashtag> 64 </hashtag> , please just concede . so , you admit defeat to a child ? you have no argument and can only name call . answer my posts with something other than ad hominem or admit defeat .	1

we are still waiting on you to show how the government will determine coverage with your plan . and more importantly , how it will pay for it , specifically . until you clear up that 900 lb elephant , it ' s all moot . the assumption that we should not give govt . more and more control is the default . you want to change that . <repeated> the burden of proof is on you . the govt . has to make determinations - - everyone knows that . it ' s a govt . benefit , after all . the question is , how it will do that . how did you private insurer determine the coverage in your plan ? do they ever make case - by - case determinations not to cover something ? i strongly urge you not only to read the house bill and the upcoming senate bill , but also to read your own health insurance plan , in detail , fine print and all , as well as to look into their record of denying claims . it ' s one of those things that most people do not realize is a problem until it affects them directly , at which point it ' s too late .	0

marriage has other important functions ? like what ? i am not going by what anyone has told me , i am going by what i see : men typically marry for steady * * * * * , women typically marry because they want kids ( eventually counts ) or they want someone else to come home to and do not mind the side effect of kids . <allcaps> holy cow </allcaps> ! <repeated> is this the " sacred institution of marriage " you and jyoshu are so fervent to protect ?	1

i would like to address the theory of evolution point - by - point . since i do not want to misrepresent the theory , i have used an explanation of darwin ' s theory from gould ' s book , " full house . " on page 138 , gould states : 1 ) all organisms tend to produce more offspring than can possibly survive . 2 ) offspring vary among themselves , and are not carbon copies of an immutable type . 3 ) this variation is passed down by inheritance to future generations . ( we know that black folks have black kids ; white folks , white kids ; tall parents tend to have tall children ; and so on . ) 4 ) if many offspring must die ( for not all can be accommodated in nature ' s limited ecology ) , and individuals in all species vary among themselves , then on average survivors will tend to be those individuals with variations that are fortuitously best suited to changing local environments . since heredity exists , the offspring of survivors will tend to resemble their successful parents . the accumulation of these favorable variants through time will produce evolutionary change . a fairly good explanation , toned down a bit from darwin ' s explanation ( for the average person who does not have a <allcaps> phd </allcaps> in biology ) .	0

what i have the guts to do is to submit to gods perfect understanding and not hold the eternal god of time and space to the limited perspective which we have as finite beings . to claim superior knowledge to a perfect , holy and eternal god is the epitome of " arrogance " which you obviously are not lacking . i am humble enough and introspective enough to look at my own past , recognize my own human frailties , nature and shortcoming and humble myself before his perfect wisdom and knowledge to see clearly that which is not clear to me at the time . also , just to clarify , god has not told me or anyone else to kill anyone enmasse in 2000 years since the advent of the age of grace which jesus , our messiah ushered in . er . . . how do you know that god has not told anyone to kill enmasse ( in the last 2000 years ) ? does he run all his orders by you ?	1

i personally think that abortion is wrong . i think that a fetus is still a baby . i do think that abortion can be okay but only if the mother ' s life is in danger , otherwise they should live with it . they should have stayed away from the causes of pregnancy . if you think that it ' s ok when the mother ' s life is in danger . why would not it be ok when her life is not in danger ?	0
the process to fossilize a bone is painfully slow . non - fossilized tissue can not survive more than a few years , let alone long enough for any other part of the bone to become fossilzed ! it would decompose ! actually , the process of fossilisation is not slow and can be done relatively quickly . all what you need is for sediments to quickly cover a dead ( or an alive body - as what would have happened to noah ' s flood ) and hence , fossilsation can occur rapidly ; evolutionarly speaking , fossils take millions of years to fossilise a bone , but unless the bone is covered by sediments quickly , the bone will never fossilise .	0

2 ) along the same lines , how did the appendages created by mutations actually become something usefull ? for example an animal might have developed a wing like appendage , but it wouldn ´ t have the correct muscles that it would need to actually move the wings . i suspect that you are thinking of birds . but early birds had fingered claws on those wings . it is generally true that no organ ever springs into existance completely developed where nothing existed before . the wings of bats , birds , and pterodactyls are merely the modified fore - limb of a tetrapod . there is evidence that insect wings may have arisen from some sort of thermal panel . and of course , size has considerable relevance to flight . wingless spiders fly by spinning a loop of silk that is carried by the moving air . very small insects require almost no wings to fly . what they do is more similar to a whale in water than a bird in air . if by chance , a small animal is upsized because of a competetive advantage , and the wings are too , then it becomes a larger flying animal .	0
are you joking ? christians cannot legally be discriminated against in employment , housing and accommodation . gays can . christian couples can marry . gay couples can not . christians can join the military and mention they are christian . gays can not . christians can freely adopt children anywhere . gays can not . enough ? hmm <elongated> , the employment , housing , and accommodation thing is really state based and for employment i am pretty sure every state does not allow you to ask about sexual orientation . as for marriage . <repeated> anyone is allowed to marry ( so long as they are of age ) . you just have a problem with the definition of marriage . as for the military thing . <repeated> seems like a complicated issue . where does a gay man shower for example ? the womans bathroom ? there own special bathroom ? the mens bathroom ? other issues involving relationships could arise as well . as for the adoption thing . <repeated> only florida does not allow it outright .	0

rubbish , there are many that argue otherwise . the life of twins can be viewed as starting at the moment the zygote / embryo splits for example . the reality though is there is no single point at which a human life begins : the moment the egg and sperm form , the moment of conception , first division and implantation , the moment the heart starts to beat , the moment of birth etc all mark stages in the formation of a new life . oh yeahrubbish rubbish , scientifically speaking , human life ( using a most bsic term ) begins at conception . the twins exist as two seperate entities the moment each contains the individual human dna . seems to me you better be certain when it begins before you go around ending it . if you are driving at night an you " think " you might see a person ahead in the middle of the road you are hopefully not gonna drive over that person . instead that uncertainty should lead you to stop . if you dont like that example , consider a hunter who is unsure what is in the bushes .	0

the benefits aspect can be resolved simply by petitioning the government to stop using the word marriage and substitute in its place the word civil union and allow any couple ( of age of consent ) to join in a civil union . right . . . but rather than removing every reference to marriage from every state and federal law and replacing it with the words ' civil union ' and then extending the right to participate in a civil union to gay people and straight people alike , would not it be way easier just to , uh , let gay people get married ? besides , if the idea of gay marriage is seen as an ' attack ' on straight marriage , how exactly is the notion of removing ' marriage ' altogether going to be construed ? not as a friendly compromise , i am betting . oh yeah . way easier . which is why gay marriage has come such a long way since it started . <wink> marriage would only be removed from any legal document . it will still appear in religious documents . the compromise will be a hell of a lot more amicable than the tension that currently exists .	1

the death penalty assures that an incorragable criminal never has the opportunity to kill anybody else . in prison , the criminal could a ) kill another inmate , 2 ) kill a guard , 3 ) escape and kill a civilian , 4 ) have their sentence commuted and get out to commit another crime . quote : would you agree if the death penalty was banned ? no , for the reasons stated above and one more . some people do not deserve to live . <repeated> like sh , for example . __________________true , gang members put in prison often kill other opposing gang members in prison so that is true . they also get put in prison and are proud some of them , gang leaders consider it a mark of honor something some of them getting caught by the ' fuzz ' and put in jail . who are we to decide who is to live ? what makes us so much better ? hitler didnt deserve to live but that does not give us the right to kill him . i agree with shooter and proud but hey heres a situation , why do not we give murderers fates to the ones most hurt by their crime , and rapists fates are decided by the ones t hey rape . they would know the best . if the ones raped are too young such as under maybe 10 or are like seven or its a loved one and they can not seperate justice from love , then the case be decided by law . give them the chance to live in solitary confinement , give them the chance , we can always take it away . but those killed do not get no more chances . in prison if they do kill put them in confinement . same with the others , if they are in solitary and they succeed in killing someone else , death penalty then fine . but gang murders should be different , if someone is in jail for killing a gang member in a fight or something like that , it is murder but it isnt as open and as clear justice as it is if they shot a four year old in the head for being related to someone in an opposing gang . then its wrong flat out , solitary or death penalty . personally id be for giving them death penalty for anyone who would do that . but i have two three year old cousins who i love to death and would kill anyone who harmed them so i do not want anyone to get away with killing kids . child killers are some of the worst criminals there are . so , in summary , you are not against the death penalty on principle . you just want it used judiciously ? same here . where we will differ is in the details of what ' s judiciously .	0
yes , but the title comes with benefits . people will definitely look differently on your resume if they see ' legally united ' over ' married ' . it ' s all well and good that everyone has a water fountain , but if that separate water fountain is not really the same , then it ' s not fair . do you know what a marriage is under the law ? oh yeah , that ' s right , a legal union . they are the exact same thing just with different names , its like if i had two identical roses and called them joe and sam , they are still both the same rose .	1
since you brought up the questions , i wonder what your answer would be to that second question : " can one girl kill herself or do harmful things to her body if she chooses . <repeated> even against the other heads will ?

sorry i missed your thread on that . it sounds like you are mainly concerned with health issues that could very potentially lead to the mother ' s death and or / complete debilitation ( like paralysis ) , and i ' d be much more open to that . but as you said , we have two extremes to choose from , and <allcaps> scotus </allcaps> chose the one that does not take into account the woman ' s health for this particular procedure . i ' d also add that because this is a late term procedure , if health is the reason to not take the baby to term , then caesarian delivery very well might be an option , in many cases . and that part of the decision ( not allowing for the woman ' s health to be taken into account ) is why i do not agree with nor do applaud this decision ( in fact i am rather disgusted with it ) . if you ' d like to see a more concise view from me , you can see the thread that another_opinion started here : <url>	0

do not you dare try and give me a lecture about cherry picking ! all you ever do is cherry pick ! you come around about once a month , scour the news to find a crime committed with a gun , and you use that single incident as if it ' s evidence that there ' s a serious problem that threatens the entire nation . if that ' s not cherry picking then i do not know what is . as a gun owner i am also a property owner . or are you denying that guns are property ? i have been posting at least a few times a week . that ' s a lot more than once a month . i pointed out that the us has higher levels of gun crime than most developed nations while you tried to focus on a few tragedies in response to someone questioning the claim that criminals will always get guns . i think it ' s obvious whose argument is more cherry picked .	0

now orion , there you go trying to bash someone else ' s religion when you still have not been able to document who your god is , where it lives , and be able to substantiate your beliefs with anything other than a feel - good whim . you have created your own god - a liberal ' s god who approves of gay sex , shacking up , fornication , worshiping satan and baal ( i . e . your ' all paths lead to heaven here , frank ) , etc . , etc . you have got no credibility around here until you come out of the closet with your ' god ' . then you can run with the big dogs . i simply quoted to you your own scripture , ez . how is that construed as bashing ? de 21:20 - 21 and they shall say unto the elders of his city , this our son is stubborn and rebellious , he will not obey our voice ; he is a glutton , and a drunkard . and all the men of his city shall stone him with stones , that he die : mr 16:17 - 18 and these signs shall follow them that believe ; in my name shall they cast out devils ; they shall speak with new tongues ; they shall take up serpents ; and if they drink any deadly thing , it shall not hurt them ; they shall lay hands on the sick , and they shall recover .	0

the civil union argument is a disingenuous one . those people who are fighting against the rights of gays to marry do not want to see same - sex couples receive any rights or recognitions of their relationships . the authors of all those constitutional amendments ensured that there were no recognition of any other types of relationships in their wording . why should any of us settle for something that these very same people are going to attempt to deny anyway ? you bring up a very interesting point . all those state level marriage amendments which were voted on also made civil unions illegal as well . when polled , residents in those areas were actually unaware that the amendments also outlawed civil unions . so , not only are the anti ' s disingenuous as far as what they promoted , but were so in <allcaps> how </allcaps> these amendments were promoted .	0
once again cookie , i have shown you clearly that ahm a dam nut job wants to force the return of the 1 2 th imam through the 3 rd world war . that is his method of forcing islam onto the world as the one true religion . and all of your excuses and justifications for what he represents wont change that aspect of his beliefs and agenda . once again archie squirms when the definition of regime is pointed out to him and it nullifies his claims . <repeated>	1
the areas of america where divorce rates are highest are also frequently the areas where many conservative christians live . kentucky , mississippi and arkansas voted overwhelmingly for constitutional amendments to ban gay marriage . but they had three of the highest divorce rates in 2003 , based on figures from the census bureau and the national center for health statistics . <url> you know , i heard that from my mom last week . my parents moved to arkansas when my dad retired a few years back . mom thought it was amusing and disgusting that the state she moved to would have voted in such an alarming manor yet takes no measure to secure the marriages they already have . ironic indeed .	0
look over the heller ruling again . all nine judges agreed unanimously that the second amendment protected a right that was wholly individual in nature . the only disagreement was whether the right still applied today . stevens said that bear arms has a military meaning . so was he saying that the right is individual but existed in connection with militia service ? is this some kind of hybrid model ? interestingly , scholars who made similar claims in the past got lumped in with those who supported a collective right by the pro gun crowd . but i suppose it sounds good to say that all nine supreme court justices supported an individual rights interpretation .	0
who said anything about rape ? peter tatchell , a british gay activist advocated the age of consent being changed to 14 years old . you see all the straight people know that whatever ther gays get , they will want more . <repeated> and you just proved it . did he say it should only be lowered for gay relationships ? probably not . are there straight people who would advocate for changing the age of consent ? yes . there are different arguments for and against lowering the age of consent which have nothing to do with gay equality rights .	0

" that may be true , but it is not harmful so i doubt it really should be on the list . " well that may be your contention , but medically that is not necessarily true . maybe being gay does not mean you are suicidal or depressed , but there is more of it going on in the gay life than in the hetero . that in itself is a wake up call . depression and suicide are harmful , even if it does not touch you personally . if it were as simple as you say the <allcaps> apa </allcaps> would not be re - evaluating " reorientation therapies " would they and with positive critiques too . you would not have prominent gay activists like camile paglia deriding the gay community for being malcontent when those unhappy with being gay seek and desire the way to be hetero .	0
since we already had one example of a creationist lowlife tactic in the george gaylord simpson quote , i decided to skim the site and see if i could find another . i did . gee , gives the impression that dr . david m . raup , curator of geology , museum of natural history , chicago , puts little stock in the fossil record and rejects evolution , helping support the preceding assertion that surely one ’ s belief in evolution based on paleontology can scarcely be considered scientific . but that ’ s not at all what dr . raup was stating . while googling for a fuller quote , i ran across a page that showed how this – and many other – statements by dr . raup were distorted by creationists . to start with , here is a fuller quote : the page linked to just above explains how a letter was sent to dr . raup asking for his statements about how he had been quoted by a creationist journal ( one of the quotes being the one being addressed here ) . of course dr . raup ’ s reply shows that he does not reject the fossil record , nor evolution , nor the fact that the fossil record documents evolution . the page also lists numerous other creationist distortions of dr . raup ' s statements . do not you think this would fit the ' creationism is nothing but lie ' s thread a bit better ? although i notice the skeptic making disparaging remarks about your examples , it seems he attacks you more than deal with the well documented examples you have .	0

nope , read the amendment . it clearly says nothing more than one branch , and one act of governing ( making laws ) . no matter how much you ' d love for it to say more . it does not say a darn thing about ' remaining neutral ' . really ? congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; sounds like a requirement to be neutral to me . it could be rephrased : ' do not meddle with religion ! do not regulate . neither promote nor inhibit . ' why would anyone have a problem with this ? and we both know that the limitation of government regulate of rights and liberties is read today , thanks to the 1 4 th amendment , as applying to all legislative authorities in the us , not just congress . no state legislature can establish a state religion either .	0
wow a statement that is both honest and correct from a creationist ! will wonders never cease ! yes , but the statement directly contradicts proponents of " creation science " and of id . their claim is that they are doing science , even though they can not show how . scientists have claimed all along that creationists / iders are doing philosophy and religion , but not science . that is the problem . they never offer any evidence that supports their assertions , only mythology and superstition . but now we have ray admitting that creationism and id are not science and can not be included in science . they either philosophy or theology , but not science .	0

you can preach pretty religious philosophy all day long but i ain ' t buying . saying that jesus told you that all life is special does not comfort a rape victim , does not provide health care to a woman without it , does not feed a family if a single mom has to quit her job , does not provide an education if she has to quit school . reducing women to pretty quote that is hung in your kitchen does not mean squat out in here in the real world , and it does not indicate that you get it , let alone care . just cause you dont buy it doesnt mean it is not true . that life is sacred does provide a ( if not the only ) compelling altruistic basis for and responsibility to social justice whether it is actually walked out or not . i think that the fact that it is not really walked out in america proves that the majority of americans are not pro life ( including a majority of those who actually claim to be pro life ) . this doesnt negate the truth though .	0
similarly , every mutation that has ever occurred has had a definite proximate cause , and if we knew what they all were and what they would all be in the future , evolution would lie mapped out before us in all its detail . nevertheless , in the absence of perfect knowledge of these individual causes we can still describe the occurrence of such events statistically , saying how long we might have to wait , or how many trials we might conduct in order to expect a given outcome . so to say that the evolution of the nylon bug , for instance , was based on chance is misleading : the evolution of the nylon bug was based on whatever proximate cause shuffled its <allcaps> dna </allcaps> . invalid argument to assert that mutations can map a road outside of their assigned task in illogical , where would the information to do so come from ? biology works because every individual cell doing what it was created to do along with what the one next to it was , though created to perform another set of instructions creates the molecular change that the combination of the cells together would produce . but there is no additional information there . <repeated> not int he way you assert .	0

no , that logic does not hold biblical mustard ( or is it muster ? ! <repeated> ) . remember when jesus christ was nailed to the cross , and all kinds of people said things like , " he who saved others , come down off the cross and save yourself , so that we might believe " ( that ' s a paraphrase ) . well , jesus christ did not come down from the cross and save himself : he allowed himself to die . allowing himself to be banned from an internet discussion form seems trivial in comparison . so i am starting to believe that the poster here named jesus actually is jesus christ ! emoticonxangel maybe he will unban himself on the third day ( or was that three days and three nights . <repeated> )	1

because satan is a fallen angel . he had a chance to be with god , but he did not take it . he could go back to god any time he wanted to , but he does not want to . he has free will . god will not take that away , even though he can . i do not agree with this debate . if preventing the devil from interfering on earth should not be prevented by god then why is it that god did prevent the devil from interfering in heaven after he was defeated ? they are both essentially taking the devil away from an area where he could potentially harm those that are good . god seemingly saw fit for one to occur but not the other . why would that be ?	0

science tells us that there was no global flood a la noah , not that there is no god . now , if you choose to interpret that as a reasonable person and realize that science shows that " a noah ' s flood - causing god " does not exist , then kudos . this does not mean that there is no god whatsoever . the error you are making is that you are equating creationism with god . we have disproved special creation . handily . so one might say that there ' s good evidence that a god represented by a literal interpretation of the bible does not exist . but that does not mean that no god exists , or that a christian god does not exist . that ' s the standard dance . victor stenger did not say it that way . on the back of his book , one review puts it this way ;	0

theories and laws are completely different . i think this paragraph should answer your questions thoroughly . true until proven otherwise eh ? xcaliber and you must get along great . you have things backward and you are probably being confused by the ' experiment to falsify a theory ' , that is a tenet of science based on the generalization that untrue theories are easily disproved . no logician ( and by extension no good scientist ) would ever hold a lack of disproof as proof . oh right theories are never proven , so in fact your definition of theory would go something like this - > ' an idea that is not disproved which we assume is true ' .	1

the vast majority of proclamations and assumptions illustrating a cultural gap between science and christianity , such as this post , are over emphasized and exaggerated as they focus on people who are expected to be out of touch ( ie . people educated in the 40 ' s and 50 ' s when higher education was less common ) or a very small percentage of christians . christians included in mass people of all academic backgrounds who find their paradigm consistent with their viewable ( and non - observable ) reality and by alienating them in mass by focusing on the minority of christians you perpetuate falsehoods . actually , the more educated a person is , the less likely he is to be a creationist . creationists tend to be semi - literate ( poorly educated ) , rural , poor , and female .	0

i am assuming static because that ' s the case i am interested in . in real terms , i am holding a ball ; it ' s motionless with respect to the earth . i let go . what about warped space makes the ball move towards the earth ? that ' s the specific question that i am trying to get an answer to . yes , the marble should roll towards the ball regardless of the orientation of the sheet . if you use a horizontal sheet then the analogy works as long as you do it in the presence of gravity , but that smacks of a circular definition to me . an analogy for gravity that requires gravity does not convince me , or explain anything to me . so you are asking how a gravitational field overcomes the intertia of a less massive object placed within said field ? i do not know but your question kind of confused me : in this example the only reason the object is not moving is because you are exerting an opposing force to counter that which the warped space has induced on the object ( gravity ) . all that has changed when the object is released is it can accelerate freely and we can observe the resulting notion . i see what you are getting at - the question could be rephrased as how is an object in a region of warped space constantly under an acceleration towards the centre of the gravitional field , the strength of which depends upon the size of the bodies and the distance separating the two ?	0
originally posted by debategirl88 1 . jesus did not go to heaven he went to hell . he couldnt go to heaven because he had all of the sins of the world on him . if ya know anything about the bible you would know that sin does not go to heaven . that means jesus spent 3 days and 3 nights in hell . three days ? non christians supposedly spend an eternity in hell , not the weekend .	1

you have claimed god is real , and unknowableto claim knowledge of the unknowable is self - contradictory . yawn , again you keep repeating this . you not only refute yourself by providing an example of knowledge of the unknowable , but you gave an example of what is unknowable , by telling me i ' d never be able to know you !	1

true . it would have to go through the lower courts unless ' fast - tracked ' . scotus could rule that ffca is not applicable because it is a license issue and not a statute . that ' s the sad state of affairs that exists today . we can not depend on the scotus acting in accordance with the constitution . emoticonxmad imo , the creation , by an activist scotus , of a phantom right is more dangerous than the loss of that bogus right . if we had a scotus that foillowed the constitution and did not dabble in legislating , i would not be fearful of ' big brother ' . there are ' real ' safeguards to protect us from that possibility , so we do not need scotus to ' make up ' new ones . this i do not agree with . i cannot see how the court could rule in favor of doma based on 1 4 th amendment protections . as far as the law goes , the marriage license from couple a from state 1 is the same as the license from couple b from the same state . how could it be constitutional to refuse to recognize the marriage license from couple a , yet recognize the marriage license from couple b from the same state ? that is unconstitutional .	0

good i will be linking this view of yours in the future . what you say will be used against you . used against me ? i never denied this . surely you refer to this in terms of gay marriage . considering i do not believe gay marriage is a right i do not see how my words do you any good .	0
i am sure you have convinced yourself that was what you saw . however , suprisingly ( or not so ) , none of the ' prayer over the terminally ill ' has ever been able to be confirmed . in double blind tests , there is zero effect on prayer to health and recovery . confirming god is , at best , a one - on - one job . <repeated> anyway . unless someone has personally experienced the things of god - how would one go about proving it ? i know , i know . <repeated> can not prove a negative . <repeated>	1

and in any case , saying ' it has not happened yet ' is hardly logical proof . it has not happened yet is not absolute proof , just that it makes the probability of it being wrong quite small . by the way , if you are in the least bit intellectually honest , i challenge you to actually act on any of those doubts about the reality of existence and any other reality that we understand from all human experience . otherwise , if you never act on those doubts , you are simply being hypocritical .	0
. <repeated> many of carl baugh ' s creation ‘ evidences ' . sorry to say , aig thinks that he ' s well meaning but that he unfortunately uses a lot of material that is not sound scientifically . so we advise against relying on any ‘ evidence ' he provides , unless supported by creationist organisations with reputations for biblical and scientific rigour . where are those organizations with such scientific rigor ? if they truly do exist , they must be in the position to understand the god of the gaps they are worshipping has become microscopic .	1
the whole point is that you can not use this warped version of the razor for hypothesis testing . in the example , impetus was a hypothesis for a cause for movement . ockham eliminated the hypothesis as a description of the phenonmenon . and if there are two competing hypotheses that are actually hard to choose between ? as they get closer , it becomes less possible to choose by instinct or testing . a principle comes in handy .	0
next they have trashed god ' s creation by diverting everyone ' s attention . it ' s a subtle move that not many people have noticed . but i have noticed . what they have done is a clever sleight - of - hand move . science no longer looks at animals . they no longer study how organisms interact within their environments . instead they have turned everyone ' s attention to genes , bacteria and viruses … . and this is because they know full - well that most people know nothing about these things … . thus , they assume ( correctly , unfortunately ) that most people will just take their word for it . the concept that science no longer looks at animals boggles my mind . my brother is a wildlife biology major in college meaning his primary focus is . <repeated> looking at animals and their relationships to one another . it is somewhat understandable that your misconception could arise because molecular biology and genetic engineering are the latest crazes in science . the simple fact is most of the big breakthroughs when studying whole animals have been made . a similar turn has occured in chemistry . i could argue that chemists have subtly turned away from chemical reactions . all the research now is about electron orbitals and nano - structures . the reason for this is these are new fields that are relatively young and many scientists are interested in them . i myself am doing research on buckminster fullerenes . it does not mean we have abandoned good old fashioned reactions , we just have more field to play in now .	0

humans have an average life expectancy of 70 - 75 yearsâ … with a maximum of around 120 . but what happens if a man marries his first cousin ? it has been shown that life expectancy of such offspring diminishes by 10 years . this is because of the large numbe how about the individual ' s offspring ? is a " subtract 10 years " gene encoded in the genome just because of one marriage ? still no evidence .	0
originally posted by wsm2506 : personally , i think it is the inability of mankind to accept the fact of their eventual mortality . so , they conjure up " gods " that reward or punish with " everlasting life " ( immortality ) . it has been true through out history . nice observation , chum , but the real god - the god of abraham , isaac , and jacob - is alive and well and wants to see you when you die . oh , ez , so this god of yours wants to see me , does he ? well and good . because when i have access to that god he is going to get an earful from me about how his people have screwed over the world .	1

his opponents were not overlooking " most likely " . instead , they were taking " most likely " to the extreme and saying " this is what it actually is " . you do the same thing with your dead animal and car vs alien . while you say " most likely " , what you really mean is that the alien hypothesis is wrong . and my interpretation of my writing is that i did not mean that . who has more authority ?	0

no it f****n <censored> ' is not ! if that was the case then plessy v . ferguson should have been used as precedent for all the following cases that dealt with segregation and racism . in plessy the supreme court ruled that black men were not entitled to the same facilities as white men , rather they had to have their own private facilities , separate from those of white men . forget precedent , the supreme court should instead focus on what is truly constitutional regardless of what previous judges have ruled . i think he is just disturbed because he did not get his 40 acres and mule ?	1
well its not . <repeated> are not you more concerned about those people that have a abortions after unprotected sex ? no i am not . to me it does not matter how the fetus got there , and seriously , why is it relevant for you to know that ? what result ? describe to me the result and we will see if its the same . well . with condoms . <repeated> you have no baby . and with abortion , you do not have any baby either . <repeated> no i am not . well you certainly should be . to me it does not matter how the fetus got there , and seriously , why is it relevant for you to know that ? wow . <repeated> i ' d say i am surprised but i am really not . so you are saying that people who do not want a baby stupid enough to have unprotected sex are on an equal playing field with those who properly applied protection which failed ? that ' s ludicrous and you really should know better . well . with condoms . <repeated> you have no baby . and with abortion , you do not have any baby either . <repeated> you left out a few important details there buddy . with the killing of a 3 - month old with an axe you have no baby . but its the same result ! yippee !	1

bryan makes a good point though . bloomberg is basically trying to suggest that if we got tough on gun laws here in virginia that the crime rate in new york city would go down . this is pretty doubtful . you never really see someone go ' man , i ' d x <elongated> your head off but guns are too expensive ' . instead , people are just smart enough to get guns where it is easiest . should those 10 states suddenly become the hardest states to get guns in than you ' d see 10 other states be on that list with the exact same crime rates . the reason we can tell this is that virginia and those other named states do not have higher crime rates than the cities with strict gun laws . i do not think much can be inferred about the relationship between guns and crime by comparing the crime rate of a densely populated city with the crime rate of a whole state . virginia has a higher homicide rate that most canadian provinces which is probably a better comparison - homicide offences , number and rate , by province and territory is it possible to make it much harder for criminals to obtain guns ? yes , i think so . if your boat is sinking then you have to plug all the leaks not just some of them . if you keep plugging the leaks then eventually you will reach a state in which significantly fewer criminals are obtaining guns . why do i say this ? because significantly fewer criminals are obtaining guns in developed countries with stricter and more consistent gun laws . in the us , there is too much inconsistency in gun laws .	0

look around . faith did not spontaneously generate out of thin air . it is obviously part of our psyche . every civilization throughout history has felt the need for some type of faith . even on different sides of the planet . it ' s as natural as the sun rising . but what about the hypothetical ? i can not think of a single child on this planet that has never been exposed to the ideas of the supernatural . so , what i was asking is whether faith is nature or nurture . that ' s why i brought up kids being afraid of the dark , likely no matter what anyone tells them . i think it ' s this fear of the unknown linked to the " logical " brain of a human that possibly creates this need for explanations . but faith involves specifics , so when the specifics are filled in and " make sense " to more than one person , these specific " explanations " can be passed down . so i do not know how much of faith is nature and how much is nurture .	0

the concept of a gay family makes me a little uncomforatable , but i can not formulate any logical arguements to support marrige segregation . by default , i am a supporter of gay adoption . any two loving people can bring up a family just fine . as for marrige , it began as a religious institution , but has been ingrained into american society as a cutural union . gay people deserve the right to recognition in front of the world as a couple , as a partnership . spicygirl is more uncomforatable with gay couples than i will ever be , and that will never change . i would bet money she has not figured out her sexuality just yet . that aside , there is no logical argument to deny gays rights . if you have one , i would love to hear it . i am back ! <repeated> had to re - visit the real world . anyway , how is it that you say i am confused about my sexuality , because i do not approve of gay marriage ? ! <repeated> that is weak ! people always claim things like that when they have nothing else to say . i am straight as hell , and you really do not know me engough to say diffrently . but you on the other hand must be confused .	1
folks should be aware that every state in the united states except florida allows gay people to adopt as single parents . the issue comes in many states when a same - sex spouse tries to adopt as a second parent . some states permit this and some states do not . it ' s weird indeed that all states except one allow single gay people to adopt children , but many do not allow gay couples to be adoptive parents together . it makes no sense to me , since two parents are usually better than one . does the sexual orientation of the would - be single parent even come up ?	0
1 . are you referring to " christian " creationism ? intelligent design ? if so , then it ' s nothing more than a christio - centric argument . there ' s no difference between christian creationism / id and the wapuri warrior ideal creation myth which focuses on the divine parrot . if you are focusing on christian creationism vs evolution , there is more than one system of creation , and it does not necessarily revolve around one omnipotent , omniscient being . it could be an accident as well ! what one thing is an obvious fact from history ? you are talking about western civilization . western civilization ' s religious beliefs are not the be - all , end all , of creation . <repeated> there ' s as reason to believe in spontaneous generation as there is in christian creationism . you can also use any eastern or south american or native american belief system of creation . creationism is not something new , it was the prevailing view of scientists up until darwin . none of them belived in a divine parrot that is just plain silly . in the crucible of natural science throughout the middle ages , the scientific revolution and well into the 1 9 th century theology was the queen of the sciences . now we subject students to higher math studies that they will most likely never use and speculations about conceptual mechanisms like natural selection that have no practical application . naturalistic presumption has become sacrosanct in the rhetoric of the professional scientists who have been crystal clear on how they define creationism . you can ignore the statement by d.j. futuyma and identical ones made by gould , mayr , dawkins , dobzhansky and others but not without departing from mainstream evolutionary biology .	0

well , my views are probably shaded by my anger of religion , after being under its influence for all of my childhood and a better part of my adult life . i am going to get on board my pontoon boat on this beautiful 70 degree autumn day and float out on the lake and ponder . maybe a more reasoned perspective can be found at the lapping of the waves below and in the intense blue sky above . well , i am back from my rejuvenating outing . did i have any epiphanies , you ask ? what , one wonders , could the old masters have produced if their minds were unrestricted , their canvases allowed to contain any subject capable of being conceived , without the censorious church acting as final arbiter and judge ? mankind could have had this centuries earlier to uplift us in troubling times , and ennoble us in our daily pursuits .	0
another view of this nylon - eating - bug is given . <repeated> " finally , mr cerutti is out of date about this new nylon digesting ability allegedly from a frame shift . new evidence shows that the ability was due to plasmids [ e . g . k . kato , et al . , ? a plasmid encoding enzymes for nylon oligomer degradation : nucleotide sequence analysis of poad2 ? , microbiology ( reading ) 141 ( 10 ) : 2585 ? 2590 , 1995 . ] in fact , more than one species of bacteria have the ability , residing on plasmids . this suggests that the information probably already existed , and was just passed between different types of bacteria . " " all that would be needed to enable an enzyme to digest nylon is a mutation causing loss of specificity in a proteolytic ( protein - degrading ) enzyme . this may seem surprising ? how would a loss of information create a new ability ? answer : enzymes are usually tuned very precisely to only one type of molecule ( the substrate ) . loss of information would reduce the effectiveness of its primary function , but would enable it to degrade other substrates , too . since both nylon and proteins are broken down by breaking amide linkages , a change in a proteolytic enzyme could also allow it to work on nylon . if this process were continued , the result would be a general enzyme with a weakly catalytic effect on the hydrolysis of too many chemicals to be useful where much selectivity is required . to put it into perspective , acids and alkalis also catalyze many hydrolysis reactions , but they also lack specificity . indeed , an inhibitor of a protein degrading enzyme also inhibits the action of the nylon degrading enzyme " <url> gave their usual doubletalk " whilst this particular case does not " prove " evolution , it is consistent with , and supportive of , the theory of biological evolution . " why do they say this ? because it ' s still a bacteria . it ' s not like it suddenly became a large multi - cellular organism . but it might just prove that this bug was so well designed that it can cope with newer situations . one site does say that it , the bacteria , had the capability already within it of change ? not resultant in ? mutations ? , but more like switching on previously dormant apparatus . <url> poster on another forum summed the problem up like this . <repeated> " in order for species to advance there would have to be a net information gain , which is not the case with nylon eating bacteria . the bacteria gained the ability to digest nylon , therefore was able to survive in a new environment . two distinct advantagesbut , the bacteria lost its ability to survive in its old environment , eat its former diet and suffered a 98% loss in efficiency . three disadvantages . so by taking two steps forward and three steps backward , where is the net gain ? if nylon eating bacteria was " proof " of evolution , we would still be pond scum , but with the ability to digest whatever happened to become the primary food source . " <url> none of these alternate views go outside the framework of evolution . they all use poor wording , though , and try to lead one to some conclusion about " information " or something .	0

5 ) moving on , if we look teh other way , evolution is actually a theory not physically proven , one of it s theory suggested that human started out in africa while another in asia , but if u look at them none resembles the other and none have a characteristic of an animal . and of course , the theory of gravity is not " physically " proven either . neither is the heliocentric theory or atomic theory or the germ theory of disease . however , evolution has been observed to occur and the current theories are the best explanations that we have for the observations . as far as your mangling of the " out of africa " theory , it would be nice if you actually learned what you are talking about before you babble such nonsense .	1

then there is the argument that flaws in the death penalty lay with the judiciary system , not with the actual penalty itself . while anyone can accept that a “ perfect ” judiciary system would only send real murderers to death row , even if this were the case , it does not negate the problems mentioned before . well , what faults ? you say that innocent people are sentenced to death far too often . well , the death penalty does not sentence people , our judiciary system does . the death penalty is mearly a punishment . i will agree that some innocent people have been sent to death row , and when their innocence was discovered , they were released . a perfect judiciary system would not sentence innocent people , and would alleviate all problems with the death penalty . if we had a perfect system and no innocent person was ever sent to death row , we could take them directy from sentencing to a little room beside the courtroom containing a bed and a few drugs , put an iv in them , and carry out the sentence before the jurors got out of the courthouse . of course , we know that our judiciary system is an imperfect thing , so we understand the need for appeals .	0

evolution implies species go through a process of advantagous and purposful change no it does not . first , the changes may not be neutral . i will presume that you are intelligent enough to grasp that idea the mutations in and of themselves are neither advantagous nor disadvantageous , and the they have no purpose . evolution happens when the mutations ( and other mechanisms that increase genetic diversity ) are acted upon by other mechanisms of evolution . even in natural selection there is no purpose . natural selection is differential reproductive success . some organisms tend to produce more offspring because they have characteristics that give them an advantage in a particular environment .	0

libertarians are social liberals and economic conservatives . they want decreased regulations on society ( legalize drugs , gay marriage , etc . ) . <repeated> and here is the crux of the matter where i think libertarians are missing it : as one founding father said , " there can be no liberty without virtue . " someone else once said , " intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their bindings " . if the god of the bible is right , a nation which legalizes sin and intemperance loses the favor of god . and when the sins of a nation reach their fullness ( in god ' s eyes ) , that disfavor can turn to judgment ( genesis 15:16 , deuteronomy chapter 28 - " the blessings of obedience and curses of disobedience ) . therefore , while many of the libertarians mean well on liberal social issues , they nevertheless either do not see the big picture , or they do not believe it will occur .	1
creation : the belief that the universe ( and of course everything in it ) was created by some supernatural entity . to support creation you must first tackle the concept of something " outside " the knowable universe . because this is irrational , the entire concept of creation is irrational to " believe " in . you can believe in it , but you must accept that the belief is not a rational belief .

in the following example that you provided : what is the context of the word ' truncated ' ? the way i read it - it is talking about a truncated string of code or something . what was truncated ? the gene and therefore the enzyme it produces . <allcaps> lpl </allcaps> is the designation for a gene that encodes lipoprotein lipase , an enzyme that hydrolyzes lipids in lipoproteins . the actual gene encodes a protein of 475 amino acids that becomes a mature protein of 448 amino acids after cleavage of a signal peptide . one study was able to identify 3 common snps ( single nucleotide polymorphism ) in the coding region of the gene , 2 of which result in small changes in enzyme function in european populations . the third <allcaps> snp </allcaps> converts that locus to a stop codon and results in an enzyme that is 447 amino acids long . thus , the enzyme has been truncated . the resulting enzyme , <allcaps> lpl </allcaps> s447x , is functional . in fact , it results in lower incidence of vascular disease and lower blood pressure . other truncations result in non - functional enzymes .	0
okay , here ' s the hypothesis i pulled out of my rear . long ago , some females began to wear primordial shoes . the newly evolved shoe - wearing gene was selected for , as females with leather booties were less likely to cut their feet and acquire a deadly infection . this prolonged lifespan set up a selective pressure to develop a shoe fetish among males . males who became attracted to the booties would be at an advantage , as they would more likely impregnate the bootie women who in turn would be more likely to survive to take care of their sperm products . your hypothesis falls apart with your first statement . we all know that it would have been impossible for only " some " of them to have shoes . if one had them , then you can pretty much guess they all . <repeated> just had to have them . now you make no inference to men having shoes . here we can agree . <repeated> women probably did invent shoes what is your theory about the foot fetish gene ?	1

the day when you have to walk into that abortion clinic and make that decision , you stand up and tell me what a real man is . those poor girls and women who go through abortions did what they had to do , more than you could ever do . do not stand on your high horse and lecture the world on the virtuousness of your position . do not talk about being virtuous , be virtuous . a " real man " helps those who he loves , whether he likes what they did . a father loves his sons and daughters , despite what they do , rather in spite of what they have done . good day to you . right on ! a real man supports those he loves , through thick and thin . he does not try and control the things he can not either . in the end , it ' s not a man ' s decision . it is not his body , therefore , he has no right to make the ultimate decision . he can only express his view . that ' s about it .

it may help to look at election in this way ( wow , i almost wrote evolution emoticonxic ) . <repeated> god is deserving of all glory . in fact , because god is ultimate perfection , he seeks to glorify himself . because humans are not god , we are not deserving of his glory . in order for god to demonstrate his glory , through his characteristic of justice , he allows us to go to hell . however , another characteristic of his glory is that he is merciful . in his mercy he chooses some to be saved and with him in heaven . thus two of his characteristics are being glorified ( mercy and justice ) . and as i have already pointed out , this notion that god needs to glorify himself smacks of narcissism on a cosmic scale . why would god in any way need - - or even want - - to demonstrate his glory ? he ' s god : he knows how glorious he is ! is not that enough ? and again , as already pointed out , i do not find arbitrary salvation of an undeserving few to be merciful , nor do i find arbitrary damnation of an undeserving many to be just . the calvinist vision of god strikes me as a celestial tyrant .	0

this is a statement written by someone who obviously has not read scripture . one of the most astonising " proofs " if you will , that the bible is of supernatural origin , is predictive prophecy . science cannot , as you claim , " explain " everything , and it has no natural explanation for the predictions made in scripture . how can science explain through statistical probablity the over 600 prophecies in biblical writings that have come to pass ? also , how can it explain how supposedly uneducated people ( uneducated in the ways of modern science ) wrote about astronomy as if they knew about the universe as we do today . how could they have described the hydrological cycle as we have only come to know it recently ? ecclesiastes 1 : 6 the wind goes toward the south , and turns around to the north ; the wind whirls about continually , and comes again on its circuit . how did they know that the earth " hangs on nothing " when the accepted norm of the day did not even accept that possibility ? job 26 : 7 he stretches out the north over empty space ; he hangs the earth on nothing . how did they know that the " vapors " of the earth rise to create moisture , that is seeded by lightning with nitrogen and then falls as rain to fertilze the soil ? jeremiah 10:13 when he utters his voice , there is a multitude of waters in the heavens : “ and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth . he makes lightning for the rain , he brings the wind out of his treasuries . ” hydrothermal vents [ 4 ] are described in two books of the bible written before 1 4 0 0 bc — more than 3,000 years before their discovery by science . genesis 7:11 in the six hundredth year of noah ' s life , in the second month , the seventeenth day of the month , on that day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up , and the windows of heaven were opened . even though the bible is not a scientific text book and does not purport to be , nowhere is it scientifically inaccurate . in addition , many of the scientific ideas you are so impressed with are nothing new to the bible . it was speaking of these things long before modern science spoke of them . the story goes " they ( scientists ) are slowly working their way to the mountain ' s peak painstakingly measuring and analyzing every step that they take . after many years of research , they finally arrive at the top of the mountain , scale over its leading edge , only to find a group of theologians sitting there with the answers all along .

you made a ' just - so ' statement about what is scientific method , and your own talkorigins site suggested this was one of several philosophies . further you said definitions do not need to be justified / proven , and again i cited talkorigins that shows this is not the case . sorry you missed it ! <happy> see post <hashtag> 115 </hashtag> of " out of china " and post <hashtag> 145 </hashtag> of " lets discuss the actual reason creationists object to evolution " for scientific method , note the later i responded to questions you ' d asked . you ' d have thought you ' d have been curious to see what answer i had posted to a question you ' d asked . and post <hashtag> 147 </hashtag> of " lets discuss the actual reason creationists object to evolution " for definitions of definition i responded to your posts on the thread of " lets discuss the actual . <repeated> " i suggest we continue that discussion there .	0
so what is it you are looking for ? sympathy ? yes , i am sorry you had to go through that . i would not wish that on anyone . it sounds like you definitely had a difficult time and i can understand why you may have hesitated in a decision to let him live . are you looking for mothers always having access to medical care which you almost did not have ? i agree , they all should . though i do not think you would have been turned away at most any hospital - - it probably happens on rare occassion . but i agree , women should have whatever medical care they need . if you are looking for me to say that ' abortion is ok in some circumstances ' , i can not do that unequivocally . if the life of the mother is in definite danger , then yes . i am looking for you to recognize that a pregnancy can not successfully happen without addressing the circumstances of the mother - whatever those may be . you can dismiss everything but health / life of the mother but i can pretty damned well assure you she will not . and whether you like it or not - the pregnancy can not succeed without her . get it ? she is not a barbie you can bend to your will with law . do you see her ? do you recognize that babies grow and live inside women ? address all her issues or you will fail in your endeavors . oh - and i do not require your sympathy - my life is great .	1
i have no facts but would speculate it was more about punishing those who chose not to marry ( rogues ) than the other way around . ever notice how wives often have a problem with their husband ' s single guy friends ? ha . a . a . a <tong> emoticonxgood good one , sinjin . what is the sound of one hand clapping ? . <repeated> ladywolf , your answer will probably come from many different sources . your idea that it evolved is pretty - much it , <allcaps> imo </allcaps> .	1
just out of curiosity , please pick out your best one ( just one , your best one ) alleged contradiction from the gospels and let me see if it holds up to close scrutiny . please include the scriptural passage and your argument or evidence to support your claim . sure . god commanded faithfulness in marriage . yet he never even raised an eyebrow at abraham inpregnating his maid , and went on to bestow blessings on him like it never happened . god commanded you should not steal . yet moses ' brilliant idea of having the israelites borrow gold and jewelry from the egyptians they knew they never were going to repay seemed mildly humorous to god at the time . god commanded that noone should make graven images of him or anything in heaven . so what ' s the deal with the ark of the covenant ? and the number of instances god commanded his people to kill , shortly after commanding them not to kill , well this could become a pretty long post . i know you asked for one , but i just started rambling because so many came to mind . pick one if you want .	1
to think that a common sense measure like this could come out of a senseless place like illinois . apparently this is a petition opposing the pending resolution before the illinois lawmakers that will deprive the rights given in the constitutions . it is to encourage the lawmakers to vote against it . the lawmakers have not yet agreed to vote it down . knowing the state of illinois , i am predicting they will pay no attention to the commoners . the only thing a glean out of this is that the common people have more sense than the lawmakers . but i have actually known that for a long time .	0

since only abstinence is 100% effective you are in effect suggesting that unless you are prepared to raise a child , do not have sex . a return to controlling women ' s sex lives through negative social pressure is the objective of the pro - life movement , not saving babies . if every pro - lifer was an adoptive parent i think they would have more credibility . why should every pro - lifer have to be an adoptive parent in order to have credibility ? this is akin to saying that every pro - choicer should have to have an abortion - - or at least face that choice personally - - in order to be a credible pro - choicer .	0

there all types of denominations of the catholic religion . however , most religions that i consider ' christian ' are really not the same as ' catholic . ' catholicism tends to be even more strict and loony than christianity . i believe you are thinking of orders , not denominations . there is a big difference . strict and loony ? could you be a little more specific , because this statement sounds like it ' s coming out of complete ignorance . you also seem to be making the assumption that all of the non - catholic christians are somehow very similar , which could not be further from the truth .	0
this is the old viability arguement , but it just does not hold up . it means that as our medical technology has gotten progressively better , and a premature baby can survive outside the womb at earlier and earlier stages because of this , the point at which it is unethical and / or considered murder has gotten earlier . there is a point , however , that the fetal lung is not mature enough to survive outside the womb even with mechanical assistance . so , unless our technology will be pretty radically different in the future , it is not about getting it out , it ' s about it not surviving when it is out .	0

i can understand the argument that gun laws may infringe on some individual freedom , but i don ` t really understand what the constitution has to do with it . sure , its much harder to make a change in the constitution , but this doesn ` t really affect wether the change should be done or not . the difference , eddie is simply this . if the constitution needs to be changed , the founders instigated a means to do so . said means is doubly hard as to make sure what is done , has been given much thought and study . the plan afoot today by the gun grabbers is to incrementally usurp the rights of free men , until , the fait accompli has been established . if the right to keep and bear arms , or any of the other rights guaranteed by the constitution are to be abridged , they must ne done so by legal means , i . e . constitutional amendment .	0

ok , i will play . assuming a fetus is a person , it depends on the body and organs of the host to live . it will put the host ' s body through stress and discomfort for months , possibly even cause it to die , at the very least it will change that body forever . no person can be compelled to give organs , tissue , or blood against their will , even to save the life of another . this is so fundamental that not even condemned prisoners can be so compelled . forcing a woman to use her organs to support another person is the same thing and should be forbidden the same way . it is clear that the profetallifers wish to make the pregnant woman a slave to her fetus .	0

for the teleporter , i agree that you would be dead . i am not trying to argue that ' you ' would ever cease to be dead when the new you was created . i believe that you would be dead the moment your body was destroyed , and when it was rebuilt , that would not be you . if two such clones were created , then there would be two clones , but neither would be you . this is why i am saying that who we are is more than our physical selves , indeed the teleporter example seems to prove it , therefore we are also our frame of reference . yes , your brain and your senses change to a degree , but your frame of reference remains that of wraith , which is why you remain you your entire life . yeah you are saying what it is not but not saying what it is . i am not sure what you mean as physical either . can i ask you out straight - - are you suggesting a metaphysical component to ' you ' ? this questions just , i feel , needs to be answered because i am still trying to grasp what your saying . to a degree ? as soon as it changes you are something else surely ? i would be wraith + 1 or , after a heavy night out wraith - 20 - - the ' wraith ' bit is just seemingly a conveniance to show nothing more than perceived lineage - - i am not the same frame of refference at any given point as i was a second ago . i might as well be called cow + 20 after eating , and assimilating a beef burger , the lineage part really is quite meaningless .	0
not all reform jews are liberals either . i know more than a few conservative reform jews . also there are fundamentalists of every christian denomination , i have even spoken to people who have encountered fundamentalist anglicans . <tong> orthodox judaism , as i understand it , attempts to perpetuate the same system of law as was delivered by moses , and more specifically the associated traditions of the last 3 - 4 millnenia . fundamentalist protestantism , meanwhile , sets itself against the christian tradition , such as the priesthood , apostolic succession , the doctrine of transubstantiation , infant baptism . the point i am making is the rejection of these doctrines does not make the fundamentalist protestant churches any less christian , nor is the rejection necessarily incorrect , and the same principle applies to reform judaism . that is the comparison i was making . i am intrigued by that last tidbit there , infant baptism . can you please substantiate that with some scriptures ?	0

reading back through this thread , i realized that i must have missed this post . i am glad you posted it because although the post is ridiculous , it nevertheless has comedic value . can the government tell someone that they cannot beat their children , even if they choose to beat them only in the privacy of their own home ? and further than that , it is an obvious fact that just because something should be in the constitution does not mean it actually is in the constitution . are you telling me that my pubes are sentient ? i agree , however i am no constitutional expert .	1
i did not see it that way at all . moore handled himself way better than i expected before i hit the play button . i thought for sure that he would be " outfoxed " to use a pun . then you must have expected him to be a mute on the show . he was basically just there ; he made no worthy comments . it was so bad he had to resort to an emotional hypothetical . he made no sense , and that comment had no part in the interview . bush does not send kids to iraq . first of all they volunteer . second of all , they are older than 18 . please let me know what comments michael moore made that you thought were worthy . you might have trouble .	1
there are in fact no transitional fossils known . some believe there are because they have been told there are . an examination of the fossils proves otherwise . what there are however , is thousands of animals in fossils which exist exactly today as they did hundreds of millions of years ago without noticable change . . so do you think that the earth is hundreds of millions of years old ?	1

yes . <repeated> nice guessing . could you elaborate a bit more , though . for example , when and why did he die of hypothermia ? is it not extremely cold at 35,000 feet ? did he not suffer from hypothermia due to the extreme cold at 35,000 feet ? did he not fall from the sky and break near all his bones when the wheel well opened for landing after a lengthy flight at 35,000 feet ? do i have to give you the flight number and type of airplane in order to get my stuffed animal circus prize ?	1
making up your own logic sounds exactly like something you would do . or maybe you just needed to redesign logic to go along with the redesigned universe you came up with when you first arrived ? that i later ' concede ' in a pm ? you mean despite the fact that probably coming up on a dozen times now i have told you premises represent evidence and you decided that the last time i told you this was a concession . <repeated> what do you think a ' logical premise ' is ? show me denying that i said a . i will be honest i have no way to prove otherwise because proof relies on logic . of course there is an objective truth here , i can illustrate the contradiction inherent in false logic using the real world ; but if you do not accept that contradiction is unacceptable . <repeated>	1

one reptile has a type of third eye , but it is not for sight nor is it permanent . it is used to absorb vitamin d from the sun for the first 6 months of life in order to help it grow into a healthy adult . then it is covered by scales . tuatara fact sheet but the question persists as to why it seemingly devolved the need for that third eye if it originally had 3 working eyes ? i mean , it did not simultaneously evolve a poison gland or some other form of defense to replace the need for it . now let us look at some insects which you will invariably mention as flaws in my argument . they too have extra eyes called ocelli , not working eyes mind you ; and neither do they aid in sight but the ocelli are simple structures and are believed they only detect light levels and movement . now why would evolution not give vulnerable flying insects perfect vision when they have allegedly had literally hundreds of millions of years and many reasons to evolve it ? are you aware that the visual acuity of insects is approximately 1% of that of humans ? and we all know that humans do not have the best eye sight in the animal kingdom . <allcaps> microscopy </allcaps> - uk / <allcaps> micscape </allcaps> - insect insights . insect eyes . honeybee legs . what really distinguishes evolutionists from creationists is that creationists will ask the questions fear to ask since this fraudulent gospel has so many inconsistencies which can not be reasonably or rationally answered , they refuse to even consider them . keep in mind that i have pointed out scientifically documented realities about what exists within the animal kingdom , but what i will get back from you are what ifs and maybes regarding these inconsistencies . why is it that you never look at what is evolutionary dogma and ask why if random mutation happens based on environmental , social and predatory pressures , has not it made more diverse selections where needed , as in a working third eye in the back of animals heads , rather than in all cases follow a proscribed formula which exists today , just as it existed in the oldest fossils ever collected ? there is no need for prey animals to grow a third or forth eye as a defense mechanism . binocular vision works . its balanced and can render 3 d positioning in the mind accurately . the lizard that you mentioned is born with a spot sensitive to light which helps the body absorb vitamin d , as humans do due to skin that is light - sensitive to a certain extent . it is not an eye for defending against predators , and it does not need one . as for insects , the fact that they have survived for such a long time goes to show that they have adapted adequately and are doing well . have you tried sneaking up on a fly lately ?	0
i prefer the playstation because you get to have free to play online and you do not have to pay online . you have some major titles that xbox does not have like infamous , ratchet and clank series , uncharted , god of war , the last of us , sly 1,2 , 3 , and 4 , jack and daxter collection , killzone , heavy rain , resistance , and others that i can not name off the top of my head . playstation does make updates on things the reason they came out with the slim ps3 was to prevent the yellow light of death to other users who had that problem because their ps3 overheated . xbox had the same problem as well but they had the red ring of death and they changed the color of their xbox to the black and they have slim as well . wow that ' s an excellent bit of knowledge . i did not know that about the ps updates , i only had 1 and 2 and i felt like the hassle of continually buying a new one was not worth the free internet . also , as for the red ring of death on xbox , i guess i wasn ' t an extreme enough gamer to let mine over heat .	0
you completely miss the point here . a long time ago with the native american creation stories some of them believed that the earth was flat . it was just a belief , and teaching everyone that is similar to us teaching intelligent design , except at least they taught it as a parent and not as a public school . oh no , i completely hit the point and exposed it for what it is . your continuing to compare the id concept to a flat earth belief proves my point even more . that and the fact that you referred to the flying spaghetti monster seven times in your last post .	0

if minorities ' civil rights are truly being taken away and hurt due to ballot initiatives , then that is a far better reason to change the system than the fact there are people out there who misuse the system . and the risk to minority ' s civil rights is , of course , the reason for the bill . they are , after all , limiting what can be started via initiative , not eliminating the initiative process altogether . the fraud was merely an example of why the change is needed . as has been argued here before , if civil rights need protecting , it ' s from the majority . allowing civil rights to be modified via the initiative process simply makes it too easy for the majority to impose it ' s will on the minority . that ' s not what a democracy is about , at least not our democracy .	0
i have got no problem with it . geez , your not normal if you do not have it circumcised . some woman will not want you ( sexually ) because of it . babies do not remember the pain . and its not just for religious purposes , come on , the main reason is for hygienics . you could get an infection or something at an older age and have to get that done at 15 - 16 or so on . how painful would it be to get it then . i am happy i am circumcised , and i am glad my parents did it . so you are happy that they chopped of the most sensitive part of your penis ? that someone took and cut out a part of your body without your consent ? what if it where your nipples ? after all nipples on men serve no purpose .	1

( i will not debate this , i am just curious as to your view ) . actually , i am of the opinion that the fetus has no natural rights of its own . any rights we grant to a person as a citizen or national are granted at the moment of birth . by granting equal rights to a 3 week old fetus that you do to a 20 year old man , you are endangering the rights of the woman who carries that child . yes , i believe that in most circumstances , the child should be carried to term , but there are exceptions to every rule , and i am not quite ready to forsake the lives and health of women to protect unborn children . yes , i think the unborn child is worthy of protection , but not any more so than the mother , in fact probably less .	0

the fact that someone does not do or believe what he is selling does not affect the validity of the argument . there are teachers who do not believe in evolution , yet they teach it because it ' s standardized . i ' d be pretty dumb to buy something from someone who does not even believe in what they are selling . those teachers may teach it , but they do not believe in it .	1
very representational with a 4% floor concerning the national parliament ( that is ; you need at least 4% of the votes to be given mandates in the riksdag ( national parliament ) ) that explains why your politician can work together i bet your current government is made of a collation ? in the uk parliament we still have a first past the post system where the party with the majority form the government . it is slightly different in scotland we have a hybrid system of pr and first past the post , the politics in scotland has changed slightly in fact the executive is made up of a collation between two parties . this has the effect of making our politics more consensual where parties can actually discuss and negotiation solutions without party politics and vote scoring .	0
well done nato ! i can not believe you took the time to fisk all of these stupid points . showing the <allcaps> ridiculous </allcaps> nature of some gun laws ! even the antis can not ( or maybe will not ) obey them ! ridiculous paperwork traps that even caught and surprised the queen of gun control ! " a story in some early editions of yesterday ' s daily news incorrectly reported that gun - control advocate sarah brady may have skirted delaware ' s gun laws when she bought a rifle for her adult son but did not declare who was going to own the weapon . " the delaware department of justice initially insisted to the news that gun purchasers must declare who the weapon was intended for so that person ' s background could be checked . yesterday , a spokeswoman for the delaware department of justice said it misinterpreted the law and that brady was not obligated to state that the gun was for her son as long as he was legally qualified to own a firearm . " in addition , a spokesman for brady said , ' sarah brady told the gun store that the gun was for her son and filled out the forms that they asked her to fill out . ' " the news regrets the error .

* <allcaps> note </allcaps> * : <allcaps> this is not for the weak at stomach </allcaps> <kiss> <allcaps> note </allcaps> * just read . <repeated> dear mommy , i am in heaven now , sitting on jesus ' lap . he loves me and cries with me ; for my heart has been broken . i so wanted to be your little girl . i do not quite understand what has happened . i was so excited when i began realizing my existance . i was in a dark , yet comfortable place . i saw i had fingers and toes . i was pretty far along in my developing , yet not near ready to leave my surroundings . i spent most of my time thinking or sleeping . even from my earliest days , i felt a special bonding between you and me . sometimes i heard you crying and i cried with you . sometimes you would yell or scream , then cry . i heard daddy yelling back . i was sad , and hoped you would be better soon . i wondered why you cried so much . one day you cried almost all of the day . i hurt for you . i could not imagine why you were so unhappy . that same day , the most horrible thing happened . a very mean monster came into that warm , comfortable place i was in . i was so scared , i began screaming , but you never once tried to help me . maybe you never heard me . the monster got closer and closer as i was screaming and screaming , " mommy , mommy , help me please ; mommy , help me . " complete terror is all i felt . i screamed and screamed until i thought i could not anymore . then the monster started ripping my arms off . it hurt so bad ; the pain i can never explain . it did not stop . oh , how i begged it to stop . i screamed in horror as it ripped my leg off . though i was in such complete pain , i was dying . i knew i would never see your face or hear you say how much you love me . i wanted to make all your tears go away . i had so many plans to make you happy . now i could not ; all my dreams were shattered . though i was in utter pain and horror , i felt the pain of my heart breaking , above all . i wanted more than anything to be your daughter . no use now , for i was dying a painful death . i could only imagine the terrible things that they had done to you . i wanted to tell you that i love you before i was gone , but i did not know the words you could understand . and soon , i no longer had the breath to say them ; i was dead . i felt myself rising . i was being carried by a huge angel into a big beautiful place . i was still crying , but the physical pain was gone . the angel took me to jesus and set me on his lap . he said he loved me , and he was my father . then i was happy . i asked him what the thing was that killed me . he answered , " abortion . i am sorry , my child ; for i know how it feels . " i do not know what abortion is ; i guess that ' s the name of the monster . i am writing to say that i love you and to tell you how much i wanted to be your little girl . i tried very hard to live . i wanted to live . i had the will , but i could not ; the monster was too powerful . it sucked my arms and legs off and finally got all of me . it was impossible to live . i just wanted you to know i tried to stay with you . i did not want to die . also , mommy , please watch out for that abortion monster . mommy , i love you and i would hate for you to go through the kind of pain i did . please be careful . love , your baby girl <url> confucius , that is one of the biggest puddles of sentimental puppy dribble that has ever been manufactured .	1
those who object to same - sex marriage primarily ( or so they claim ) because it would " change the definition of marriage " should perhaps be made aware that that train has already left the station : merriam - webster on - line <url> dictionary . com <url> encarta <url> american heritage <url> this is not to say that every current dictionary includes such a definition . <repeated> yet . <repeated> but a number of major on - line ones demonstrably do , and to my knowledge human civilization has yet to suffer any negative effects . ( by the way , the above entries also include the typical " husband and wife " kind of arrangement as well . funny how words can have more than one meaning , is not it ? ) the whole " change the definition of marriage " is mainly a scare tactic used by anti - gay religious bigots . they do not seem to realize that words can have several meanings .	0

we do not execute people who can not comprehend the nature of their crimes and society says that , under 18 you can not fully comprehend criminal actions . actually , society has not said this . 5 judges , in very recent times , have . i for one think that some 17 year olds fully comprehend the full implications of murder , and therefore should be held accountable in the same way as an 18 year old . i guess i just do not see any reason why a jury could not address the issue on a case by case basis . i do not see the " 18 and over execution rule " in the eighth amendment .	0

the potentiality argument is often used against those who do not believe that a fetus is worthy of being called a person , a human , or whatever word you prefer to argue over . too much spin there buddy . the potentiality arguement is used by those who believe women have a right to have control over their fertility . as an aside it is also a fundemental tenent in judaism ' s view of the unborn - the foetus is a potential life , but has not yet attained that state of being , which occurs at birth .	0
no , i think i ' d have much better luck asking one of yours . ha , nice try . i sincerely doubt that . you are caught , and now just making it up as you go along . you originally said , ask any gay man and he will seem to know . i have never come across that at a rest area . perhaps i just do not know where to look and when all of this goes on . maybe i should again , consult you or your close friends if i want to know . here in michigan , they closed down the first rest area on i - 75 because of the high amount of gay encounters taking place there . maybe you should poke your head out of your closet once in a while and see what the rest of your community is up to .	1

and it ' s so bleedin ' unnecessary , too ! why not just create the universe as it is ? and just let the light take it ' s sweet time to get here ? imagine what proof for creationism that would be : we can only see stars out to 6000 light years or so ; looking at old star charts we realize that people 1000 years ago could only see stars out to 5000 light years ; and as time goes by additional stars appear in the sky as the light from them finally reaches us . if god did create the universe only 6000 years ago , the fact that we can see the entire universe now can only count as a deliberate , i will repeat , a deliberate , oh how i love that word , <allcaps> deliberate </allcaps> deception on the part of the creator . deliberate deception would be putting million year old dinosaur bones on a thousand year old planet . even more deceiving would be putting vast amounts of oil here as well which takes millions of years to create . i would put the stars in the sky in the same category as this in terms of deception . the stars could be more of a cosmetic thing as far as god is concerned . he could have just added them to our sky without concern for whether it made sense or not . i personally would not fault him for this .	1
of course this does not show numbers of couples who are ' separated ' ( and possibly sleeping around or with multiple people , but still legally married to one individual . so the article is of no use in drawing the aformentioned conclusion that homosexual couples are more monogamous than heterosexual ones , or vice - versa . and the reported data is 8 years old . anything that does not fit your preconcieved prejudices is automaticlly wrong ?	1

through the media ' s support of the presuppositions taught in high schools and under graduate institutions people all to often espouse their expertise in their knowledge of the certainty of evolutionary “ theory ” which is most always overwhelmingly lacking and incorrect . and you , on the other hand , because you are not educated in science in general , and evolutionary theory ( why the quotation marks ? ) specifically , are qualified to correct those of us who spent years in study of the topic .	1
and he accomplished all this human carnage without a gun . this just proves that if it was possible to eliminate all projectile firing weapons from existing on earth , men would find a way to commit atrocities against his own kind just as he did before such weapons existed if murder was in his heart . guns are not the issue , the corrupted heart / nature of humanity is . why do people on the pro - gun side continuously try to oversimplify the issue ? no one is really arguing that there would be zero murder without guns . the question is would there be less murders without guns . in developed nations with stricter gun laws there are less murders . at any rate , i do not think you can draw such conclusions based on one incident .	0
do you really believe not spanking your children will make them less likely to hit other children ? why ? where ' s your evidence ? i personally want my children to be proficient at violence and know when it is appropriate to use it and when not . to suggest it is never right to use violence is simply not true . spanking does not teach children to defend themselves against violence . it teaches them the exact opposite because they are forced to submit to these acts of violence and <emphasis> they are told it ' s being done out of love . do you ever wonder what conditions some women and men to accept violence from their partner ? do you ever wonder how they could not recognize it as abuse ? i will give you three guesses . different personalites process and categorize information in different ways . unfortunately for many children , this is one of them . <sad> and unfortunately i am speaking from experience .	1
when religion is discredited , is it a " win " for science ? emoticonxconfused kronus said this was a win for science . he never mentioned that religion was discredited - never mentioned religion at all . religion and science are utterly unrelated . why would you make that connection ?	0
certainly , because with calm empathy you can casually address such a matter simply because the struggle does not pertain to you personally . to be able to put into question the love of another human being is simply not only alarming in nature , but damning to the very definition of love , equality , and freedom in creation of man . <repeated> and to trump this as a question of morality only serves as a mask to curtail the prejudice objections one personally has to a ceremony , right , and relationship that person will not even be personally affected by . <repeated> it is worse then that they just do not get it . once you put some civil rights on the ballot nothing is off limits . freedom of speech , religion , assembly ect . <repeated> they are all up to be voted out of existence for an unpopular minority by the majority . they just do not get it .	0
the violinist analogy suggests that a mother has no more responsibility for the welfare of her child than she has to a total stranger . mcdonagh ' s view is even worse . she argues the child is not merely a stranger , but a violent assailant the mother needs to ward off in self - defense . ' self - defense ' never enters into it , imo . unwillingness to share ones body is not necessarily self - defense , so this does not apply .	0
the definition of deter is " to prevent or discourage from acting , as by means of fear or doubt " . a lock does nothing to induce fear or doubt in an attacker , all it can do is slow them down . as said before the best lock is only as strong as the door and screws used to hold it in place , so their effectiveness is highly questionable . see above . a lock can create doubt about the ease of entry into a residence . many criminals move from door to door until they find one that is unlocked , rather than drawing undue attention by smashing one in .	0
an independant perspective does not make it a good thing . politicians that propose anti - gun legislation do not have to live in the real world with those of us that the bill will affect , they should not be allowed to propose it . ha , that is just an idiotic perspective . we ' d have no laws ( and many important ones ) if you can not make a bill that does not affect you . sorry civil rights legislation !	1
so by your various definitions , left - handedness makes that person a deviant . most of america is right handed ( so it would be considered the norm ) , left - handed people function different than right handed people as well as behave differently in the way the go about their lives . are left handed people wrong and unnatural as well ? no one has determined why people are left - handed , and whether it is caused by genetics or early environmental stimuli . they are deviating from the norm . did you know that the word sinister is derived from the old english meaning ' left handed ' due to old beliefs about left - handedness ? do you actually ( by your previous arguments ) believe that left - handedness is wrong ? if you do not , then you cannot possibly apply your arguments to homosexuality . if you do , i am sorry , but you are ignorant . you mus think you are pretty smart huh ? well guess what ? you are confusing common , most common , majority , and norm . lefthandedness is considerd common and the norm . you are using a superstistion from 300 years ago to qualify left handedness as deviant . good try though . also left handed is genetic . it ' s not a gene but it ' s genetically related to the person ' s physical characteristics .	1

the christian theistic worldview can account for the laws of logic by stating that they come from god . god is transcendent ; that is , he is beyond the material universe being its creator . god has originated the laws of logic because they are a reflection of his nature . therefore , the laws of logic are absolute . the are absolute because there is an absolute god . the atheistic worldview cannot account for the laws of logic / absolutes , and must borrow from the christian worldview in order to rationally argue . this is totally false . the laws of logic being absolute does nothing to support a case for god . in fact , everything the bible tells us about god ' s nature indicates that god is illogical , unpredictable , unreliable and irreplicable . this is totally the opposite of logic	0

since evolutionism and creationism are both attempting to answer the same question , ( i . e . , how come existence ? ) they are mutally exclusive , and if one is true , it automatically falsifies the other . this means that if evolutionism is accepted as true , then logically creationism , and by extension the entire bible , is false . the notion that the bible is completely and uncompromisingly true is paramount to christianity . with all that in consideration , it should be no surprise that christians will do everything possible to show evolution as false i see a subtle distinction here . creationism is concerned with the spiritual origins of people . " evolutionism " is entirely concerned with explaining the nature and history of the physical world . the conflict of opinion arises out of the importance of the detail - can genesis be accepted as a parable which contains a fundemental truth or must it be taken as a historical account ?	0
i would disagree here about this , in terms of the pro - life view . it ' s not that mental existence is irrelevant . <repeated> quite the contrary ; in fact it ' s the reality that there will <allcaps> soon </allcaps> be mental existence that makes it matter . i do not think the issue of abortion should ever be divorced from the reality that the embryo will likely grow into a human being . <repeated> a human that is human by pretty much anyone ' s standards . so i suspect that the big difference here is that pro - choicers are more " in the moment " in terms of the way they view the fetus , and pro - lifers are more " long - term bigger - picture " in terms of the way they view the fetus . certainly the likely potential of what the fetus grows into has a lot to do with the pro - life position on whether it is truly human . but growth is fairly irrelevant . my sperm can grow into a human too , and have mental existence , yet ejaculating is not murder . it just becomes a huge debate on where to draw the line , therefore it is best to focus on the state that it is right <allcaps> now </allcaps> . not what it was or could possibly be . that seems reasonable to me .

obrotion became populer in the 1800 and thats oround the time evoluion became populer . and the lie that the embro has gill slits . evolution wasn ' t introduced until 1859 . when did abortion become popular ? the industrial revolution occurred in the 1 8 0 0 s . maybe that was the cause of abortion ' s alleged popularity . grover cleveland was elected in the 1 8 0 0 s . clearly he had something to do with the alleged increase in abortion ' s popularity . the american civil war occurred in the 1 8 0 0 s . it must have been the impetus for the rise in popularity of abortion . a human embryo does have features that look like gill slits . they are not gills but pharyngeal clefts . no modern book presents any information that human embryros have gill slits as if it is fact .	0

" ' arms ' in this context were military arms not the personal weapons of private individuals . the context of ' depriving of the whole nation of arms ' was the refusal of the british to conscript indians into the british army during the first world war . gandhi was an extreme anti - militarist . the statement is odd coming out of him , but he used the circumstance for political purposes to advance the cause of home rule and independence .

it has to do with freedom and equality but then again i do not expect non empathic people to understand that . looking at you answers below i would have though you would understand the concept that i get to choose who i share my life with , who i transfer my property too and who i call family . you do not understand that the government says to everyone who is a family by the issuance of that piece of legal paper . the in equality part comes in when i am told that i can not have that piece of paper but some hetero can because someone else has a religious belief that should have no effect on my life what so ever . i am saying that if so religious <allcaps> x <elongated> </allcaps> wants to force their religion on me by using that religion as an excuse for the state not issuing me that piece of paper then i want a say in their life and want the government to remove that belief . if the religious <allcaps> x <elongated> </allcaps> stay out of my life then i will stay out of theirs but if they want to get involved in my life then i want to get involved in theirs . <allcaps> eye for an eye </allcaps> equality by its very definition . you want the government out of your life and i want religion out of my government and my life . pathetic , why would you let anyone besides yourself determine who you call family ? nobody is forcing their religion on you . nobody is even saying who you can or can not get married to . what is being said is that you , or anyone else , does not have the " right " to have that marriage recognized by gov ' t . universal recognition by gov ' t does not even happen in hetro marriages . nowhere in the founding documents of this nation does it say " all gov ' t entities shall recognize all people ' s marriages " . since we have " a government for the people by the people " , the duties of government not spelled out in the founding documents are determined by the people . you have the freedom to vote your beliefs and so does everybody else .	1

will not work . " danger to the mother ' s life " has to cover allowing an abortion if there is a significant risk of psychological damage which might lead to suicide . any doctor , especially in a country like yours with a runaway litigation culture , faced with " i will kill myself and the baby if you do not abort " will decide there is a significant risk ( to his wallet mainly ) . it is for this reason that " convenience abortions " are technically illegal here in the uk , but they occur anyway . those abortions that are perpetrated as " birth control " should be outlawed .	0

gay sex is a sin and brings god ' s disfavor on men and nations . we do not need the extra grief . that ' s all you need to know . cower in fear of your god easy , i am not afraid , and nothing that you say is going to make me fear things which i believe to be imaginary . thankfully , our nation does not make laws based on your phelpsian beliefs that god punishes the masses for the sins of others .	1
i think by now you surely must be realizing that you are wasting your breath - - to them it <allcaps> has </allcaps> to automatically be true because some scientists think so . ( as if scientists are never wrong . ) but let us face it , they <allcaps> want </allcaps> it to be true so much , they are not willing , under any circumstances to consider that it just might not . why do " they " want it to be true ? some " gay " science agenda ?	1
the terrorists saw it as absolutly necessary . personally , i disagree . when we kill children in iraq , we see it as absolutly necessary , call it a horrible side effect of war . i disagree on that , too , i do not think it is necessary at all . this seems to conflict with some of your earlier posts wherein you support terrorists .	0
actually that ' s not what he said , but if we are going to bring it to gay relationships i have yet to see homosexuals campaign against heterosexual relations . i have the other way round . easyrider just does not like gay men trying to shove it down his throat ! emoticonxangel	1
i do not believe that the point you are raising will make an impact on easyriders behavior . i was hoping that talking in old english would help him understand .	1
be careful lesz , your hatred for me and your bigotry towards the bible and christianity is showing again . emoticonxwow after all , i did not write the verses that condemn homosexuality , i just posted them . and neither did god write them . they were writen by men and there was no devine inspiration . there is no difference between the bible and margaret mitchell ' s gone with the wind . oh yes i am sorry gone with the wind at least gets history correct .	1
that is not exactly true . there is written law going 2500 + years back and death penalty was not the most common punishment used . it was used only for specific crimes , while the most common practice was eye for an eye doctrine . at least until the time of the roman empire and their law . lol , read your bible more carefully next time . i do not know it in detail but well enough that i know your words are full of bs . um <elongated> . <repeated> the death penalty has always been around . i never claimed that death was the penalty for every crime , nor that it was the most common punishment . try to catch up	0
that ' s really interesting and that would be awesome if i could ask you questions my college course is based on biology so i could use the help <laugh> i can see why it would put you off certain things <happy> oh yeah . the things i do for fun just ruin my appetite . i like to look at bacteria under a couple of microscopes i have . sometimes i just place random bacteria together to see how they react . usually they dont do anything . if you do have questions do not be afraid to ask .	0
why do i think they are popular books , and not peer reviewed scientific articles ? because you know the peer review process is biased . anything submitted for peer review with a recognizable name like dembski or behe will be automatically rejected before the first word is read . the scientific community ' s problems are just that big .	0
the author is arguing that gun control in rural areas does not constitute crime control in urban areas but somehow you try to spin that into making it sound as if the author is making some blanket statement against all gun control . so what if the author is not arguing against gun control ? at last , there is indication that england has taken a step in the right direction and realized that taking all guns away from everybody is not the answer to crime .	0
no one knows anything about the constitution so how do they make claims that abortion is constitutional ? yeah , you are right dono . <repeated> so explain to me about the constitution ? <repeated> would you like to start with the federalist papers and move on from there ? i have yet to hear someone prove me wrong on the constitution . if you think that the cruel and unusual term does not apply to the living constitution then you are sadly mistaken . how do you think it became that the death penalty for minors is illegal now ? the court 1 5 yrs ago said differently ! <repeated> how can the inerpretation change with no basis other then ones own personal opinion ? this is scary . <repeated> people , you gotta think this stuff through !	1
well , of course the issue is not " limiting " marriage , but rather making it more open - ended . but again , either way , it ' ll be a moot point before too long . not true , california ' s ammendments are not doing as well as other states did . you are talking about a very liberal state . if it is decided that marriage is allowed by the courts , then you are talking about taking away rights people have been granted by the courts . i just do not think that will happen in calf . much too liberal .	0
first he ( orion ) starts with a comedy website , but then he actually gets on this thread and starts asking questions positing " what if " jesus was gay ? i know . sad indeed . orion and his liberal ilk make it a habit to come up with these sophomoric ideas . as if jesus ( who is god according to scripture ) would come out and give moses the commandments against gay sex and then turn around and incarnate as a gay man . get real . when the antichrist comes he will probably be gay ( one ot scripture alludes to the antichrist as having no affinity for women , and satan loves to mimic god ' s kingdom with some kind of diabolical twist . ) . then orion will prostrate himself before him and receive him as his long lost savior .	1

i think the obama administration has been working with republicans , and much too much . that ' s why the bill is what it is . although i think it was feingold who said that obama has gotten the bill he intended to , from the beginning . even worse , as this is not a compromise since there is no public option , for starters . btw , jazyjason , before you edited out your complimentary comment about howard dean . just wanted to say i am surprised you said anything to associate yourself thus with a such an irrational far left commie . must stay with the mudflingers and lynch mobs and , especially if they are jesus lovers , ya know . so . <repeated> i understand why you took it down . merry christmas .	1

" ( 17 . ) the glorification of firearms in movies and video games is wrong and promotes irresponsible gun usage , but the gun industry ' s advertising propaganda , which exploits people ' s fear of criminals to sell guns , is perfectly responsible . brinks plays on people ' s fears to sell security systems that do not even work . insurance companies play on people ' s fears to sell their policies .	0
i suspect that those statistics are harder to find and harder to determine ( since , once a person is dead , there is much less motivation to prove him innocent ) . nevertheless , various sources mention a number of people who have been executed despite probable innocence . here is just one of numerous sites that i found with a google search . this site ( a few years old ) claims that 25 people in the last 25 years have been executed despite probable innocence . <url> anyway , i do not think there is a formal procedure to establish official innocence after death . i do not think the mechanisms are in place in our justice system to have a trial for the dead , so we can only look at the evidence in the cases that people have privately pursued . ok , so none can be shown . how many people with a life sentence without parole have died an prison and been innocent ? my point being that a mistake does not make the sentence not worth having . in fact , with the death penalty you get more due process than someone with a life sentence . <repeated> there are not many advocates for helping those guys out .	0
i think he basically intimated that only believers have anything of worth to contribute to american society , and that the separation between church and state was a bad idea . about as contrary to kennedy ' s stance as you could get . what specifically did he say to lead you to those conclusions ? i do not know what speech you heard , but i have heard romney ' s religion speech as well as read it , and i see nothing there that declares war on secularism , or intimated that it ' s only believers who offer anything of worth , or that separation of church and state is bad . ( in fact he defended separation of church and state . ) the text of the speech is here ( among plenty of other places accessible via google search ) for people to draw their own conclusions .	0
not really , especially when checking a posters numbers takes about two to seven seconds ( depending on your connection speed ) , but the amount of time taken to actually post as often as you do is must more ! emoticonxrolleyes since he ' s commented on it several times now , and seems to have me confused with someone else , maybe he ' s channeling a past life or something - - who knows ? better yet , who cares ? <tong>	1
the last guy who owned the gun legally is a good place to start . if there ' s a stolen weapon report , so be it . if there ' s not , we investigate certainly and prosecute if the law allows . remember i support mandatory theft / loss reporting . well then maybe you can prove it somehow . california has all these laws you support , and even more than that . so if they have these laws on the books and have had them for a while now , and if they are effective at fighting crime , then you must surely have evidence of some sort to prove your case .	0
i am watching letting go of god now and following it up by the other two . great choice . you may remember her from the beethoven movies , she played the mother in part 3 . i have seen that film at least a dozen times and i like it more with each viewing . yeah i know what you mean , but i can not help watching sometimes , lol . <repeated> i treat it like taking a trip to the candy store , i am always surprised at how much research some of these atheists will do to debunk god . <repeated>	0
only if the question is from whence did you get your prejudices ? 1 ) i dont recall saying anything that i believed 2 ) someones experiences should definitly be looked at you are just one rude person . i was just sharing an experience my mom had teaching . not only that , youe are comparing a pedophiliac to a gay man adopting . what does this prove ? i never said all striaight families are perfect and i never said all gay families are bad either . all i stated was one persons direct observations on the situation . how many child of gay couples have you taught ? observed ? 30 years worth ? i believe i will take someones experience over you being rude .	0
no , the church is not evolving . neither is society , language , ethics , morality , or our ability to shop . only biological populations evolve . nonsense , societies change over time , therefore they evolve . only biological populations evolve through natural selection and the theory of evolution only applies to biological populations , but the term " evolution " applies to other things too .	0

where in the hell did all the anti - gunners on this board go ? did they all run off or give up the fight ? could it be that they have finally realized that there is no viable argument for gun control in a country that was built on freedom to bear arms ? each time the control - lobby comes up with an argument . <repeated> they get shot to pieces . ( laugh out loud ! ) it is interesting to note that both of the democratic front - runners for 2008 favor gun control . with the recent death of charlton heston , there ' s a weakness in the armor of the nra . i would go on a handgun buying spree , but i already have enough guns and ammo to stave off a thousand or so government guntakers at a place we call ' the little alamo ' .	1
are a subset of criminals ( ie not all criminals are burglars or muggers ) . ripskar pointed out that gangs ( criminals , but not necessarily burglars or muggers ) tend to have guns . he also stated that burglars and muggers tend not to have guns . lemme guess , in real life you are a lawyer , correct ? you must be because you are extremely hypertechnical to the point of absurdity . it does not matter what you call them , be it criminal or gang member of dope dealer or home invader , if somebody breaks the law then they are a criminal and it ' s as simple as that . seriously dude , you are trying to get off on a technicality here . like a lawyer trying to argue " your honor my client is not a prostitute , she ' s a female escort " . does not matter what you call it or what you try to pass it off as , a criminal is a criminal regardless of what their formal title is . so which is ripskar , do criminals have guns and are likely to shoot you in the face and kill you , or do they not have guns at all . it ' s one or the other , it can not be both .	1

whosoever shall be guilty of rape , polygamy , or sodomy with man or woman shall be punished , if a man , by castration , if a woman , by cutting thro ' the cartilage of her nose a hole of one half inch diameter at the least . - thomas jefferson that ' s your man jefferson , whom you love to quote elsewhere . how do you like those apples ? so what ? jefferson is a prime example in opposites and double standards . he believed in freedom but owned slaves . wrote the declaration of independence yet only believed in freedom for white men not women or people of color . this stance is very consistent with his double standard . he was also an adulterous , womanizer who had sex with his slave women and producing children who would remain slaves . so there again is his double standard he enslaved his own children .	0

what about your son , as mary did ? taking revenge on the wicked is god ' s perogative . irrelevant . what about the common people that were not blessed with god ' s son ? revenge : definition , synonyms from answers . com tr . v . , - venged , - venging , - venges . 1 . to inflict punishment in return for ( injury or insult ) . 2 . to seek or take vengeance for ( oneself or another person ) ; avenge . n . 1 . the act of taking vengeance for injuries or wrongs ; retaliation . 2 . something done in vengeance ; a retaliatory measure . 3 . a desire for revenge ; spite or vindictiveness . 4 . an opportunity to retaliate , as by a return sports match after a defeat . tell me , simone , how exactly does using force to defend oneself qualify as revenge ? revenge is tracking down the person that wronged you and cutting their throat when they are at their most vulnerable . revenge is not killing your attacker because you are in fear of your own life .	1

1 ) it ' s hardly " solved " . same - sex marriage is not legal in france . as of 2006 , one same - sex marriage ceremony has been conducted in france and was declared void . france has a statute authorizing civil unions , known as <allcaps> pacs </allcaps> , between same - sex and unmarried opposite - sex couples . same - sex marriage was an issue in the 2007 presidential election , with the conservative <allcaps> ump </allcaps> opposing it and the socialist party supporting it , though both candidates support civil unions ( <allcaps> pacs </allcaps> ) . <repeated> on june 5, 2004 , former green party presidential candidate noël mamère , mayor of the bordeaux suburb of bègles , conducted a same - sex marriage ceremony for two men , bertrand charpentier and stéphane chapin . mamère claimed that there was nothing in french law to prohibit such a ceremony , and that he would appeal any challenge to the european court of human rights . french justice minister dominique perben had stated that such unions would be legally void , and called for judicial intervention to halt the ceremony . same - sex marriage in france - wikipedia , the free encyclopediawhat france has is " well , both the blacks and the whites can enter by the side - door , but only the whites can enter by the main door " we would not find such an " acommodation " satisfactory for blacks . and furthermore , i think you would find that it ' s the <allcaps> anti </allcaps> - <allcaps> gays </allcaps> who have the problem with this . if obama is able to try to put up " civil unions " on the federal level , you can bet dollars to doughnuts it will be the religious right who fight him . not the gays . <repeated> if same sex couples are offered equal rights under a <allcaps> pacs </allcaps> ( or some other legally recognized union ) as married couples , why does it matter which " door " they come in through ? they get all the same benefits , including the benefits that come when one partner dies . what ' s the beef . <repeated> except that you can not say that you are " married " ?	0

quote : so it would make sense that a mold ( which is a type of fungus ) shares the same common ancestor that other fungi share , and would have a lot of biochemical similarities with them which it would not share with bacteria . but would not the biochemical similarities speak for themselves ? that is , does one have to believe that the two specimens ( which share biochemical similarities ) evolved in order to infer that they will respond similarly to antibiotics ? the observable facts of the similarities would seem sufficient ( and more scientific ? ) .	0
so you can tell me the athletes that were brought into the school to specificially play sports are going to abide by all the rules as well as the students that attend the school at their free will also , are going to spend 15 hours a week studying ? i do not think so . its more of a lesure activity than a serious requirement . do you go to study hall ? probably not . it is a requirement where the athletes sign in and sit in the library with their teams and are monitored to make sure that their studying is getting done .	1
is global warming a real threat or is it just a hoax ? i agree it ' s a threat to us but the point is whether it ' s really caused by increaing amount of carbon dioxide and how big the threat is . maybe global warming is just a part of process of global climate change which occured several times long time ago , ie , ice age things like that . as far as i know , global warming is one of the catastrophe which leads to extinction of human beings . however , there might be another problems which are also big threat to us and all creatures on the earth . anyway , i am not an expert of environment , so i might be wrong but at least i can say it seems there are some bad effetcts of global warming such as rising sea level , abnormal climate pattern , things like that . we should do something , which might not be appropriate way to solve the problem but it ' s surely the beginning .	0

what about the fact that scientific information allways changes to suit what is observed . it isnt consistent . dont get me wrong , i am facinated with science , and agree with a lot of what it has proven , but i dont think that the bible should be discarded as a piece of fiction . after all , jesus was a real person . he did exist . did he ? what secular evidence do you have from before 70 c . e . that confirms his existance ? what is the outside verification to the new testament ?	0
if so , what would be bad about allowing a view that places objective value in human life to be the basis for making law ? 1 - it is innacurate . we allow killing in times of war , in self defense , and in state sanctioned executions . so we already have a situation where , when given x mitigating factors , it is justifiable to take a life . it is impossible to say all life is equal , and then to apply that as law . people will be outraged . i know i would be . 2 - objective to who ? who gets to decide how valuable life is ? and why should they get to ? and who says they are right ? the relative value of life works fine , thanks very much .	0

i do not mean to get off on a tangent here , but it ' s our duty to protect ourselves ? right is one thing , but duty ? well let me put it like this , i consider it your duty because if you do not protect yourself then you basically shift that responsibility to someone else . not only is this incredibly selfish , but 9 out of 10 times the ' protection business ' gets outsourced to the state . this in itself it dangerous because when people decide that a third party like the state ( which has no real accountability ) has control over their lives it can all to easily lead to a situation where the state becomes tyrannical . more people have been killed by their own government than by any foreign government .	0
this sounds utterly nutsy . it could only be said by someone who knows diddly squat about babies . hah ! anger is not an emotion ? so , what do you think a new born baby goes through ? what is this already ? i am out of my nice , cozy little nest , there are bright lights , loud noises unmuffled , it ' s cold , i feel icky and i am really angry ! wah <elongated> ! happiness is not an emotion ? whew ! i went wah <elongated> and now i am cozy and warm , my tummy is full , my bottom is dry , someone is cooing soothing sounds at me . . . . where is your head , steve <elongated> ? jitobear , i always love it when you post . you are succinct and to the point and i always wish i had said what you said .	0
so you are saying that the ones who are eligible to carry a gun , those who are 21 or older , never been convicted of a crime , undergo fingerprinting , pay hundreds of dollars , attend an eight hour course held by the police , pass a firearms safety class , and weight three months to finally get their permit , would intentionally use it as an excuse to murder a teacher over a trivial matter like an unfavorable grade ? no . i never mentioned grades . you brought that one up . i am saying that having guns on school campus is not a good plan due to the high level of emotions in the area .	0
secondly , i see you are falling into the usual o.p. of your ilk : when without an argument , attack the opponent on a simple spelling error ( especially when the one letter is right next to the one intended on the keyboard " n " is right next to " b " last time i checked ) . really phyllis , get an actual argument instead of attacking your opponent on spelling errors . no , that was not an argument . it was an illustration of a point . the point was this : that in order to stand in moral judgment of god , you would have to be of higher moral character than god . in other words , you would have to be god in order to judge god . now , the point i made is that this is highly unlikely , as any being claiming to be god would not misspell words , no matter how closely the letters are on the keyboard . to be clear , i was not attacking you ( at least i did not intend to ) by calling out your spelling mistake . i was trying to illustrate a point . and the point was this : you are not perfect , and therefore , you are not god . and if you are not god , then you really cannot stand in moral judgment of god .	0
i wrote a huge post on how animals emerge pre - adapted , and continue to adapt throughout their lifetimes . do you not see how this could give the <allcaps> illusion </allcaps> of evolution ? not by any means . evolution works on genetic change that future generations will inherit . adaptation does no such thing . it changes an individual , but not its genes . for example , if my parents volunteered to be part of a scientific experiment where they two additional arms fused onto their body before i was ever conceived , i would not be born with two extra arms . on the other hand , if a genetic mutation made it advantageous to have two additional arms , and both my parents had that mutation , i would be born with both arms .	0
" modern " atheists have only been around for a short time . in biblical times , atheists were people who beleved in god ( s ) , but did not believe he / they intervened with life on earth . how and why do you think the terms have changed , and what are the similarities between tham ? in older times man had more questions without answers than today . some men believed if a god of fire because they did not understand what fire was . because of their misunderstanding they invented an answer , the fire god . today we know exactly what fire is and we do not need to invoke some mythical explanation . today ' s atheists know that there are many other questions we do not have answers for and it ' s ok to simply say we do not know instead of buying into the whole " let us - invent - some - god - to - explain - it " mentality . <repeated>	0
you behave as if i have to demonstrate that no ider has ever tried to use ic to support id . i do not and i have made no claims that one could not . ' the two points within the video do actually disprove what you said . you said that ic cannot be used to support id . when in fact , the video states very clearly that id / creationists use the argument of ic to support their ' theory . ' ( the two points being cases where the video indicates that iders try to use ic to prove id ) all i said is that they cannot . so i ask you again can one support id with ic ? youtube - fallacy of id and creationism - false dichotomy [ reloaded ] ridiculous . if ic cannot support id , id has absolutely nothing going for it , right ? including their supporters of ic , since all of them with the exception of you use it to support id . behe is wrong , dembski is wrong , johnson is wrong , every id supporter is wrong for using ic , because freedom the great thinks it ' s wrong . daewoo : ic is irreducible complexity , the idea that complex biological systems like the eye or bacterial flagellum could not have evolved through a gradual process , but had to have been formed all at once , by a designer with a function in mind . id is intelligent design , creationism with new pseudo - scientific skin , a political ploy for creationism to gain scientific respect . it failed . michael behe is an advocate of id who came up with ic .	0

diseases used to be ascribed to god and it was thought that those people who got sick deserved to be sick because of their lack of piety . now we know that diseases strike indiscriminately ( where piety is concerned ) and affect people only based on their risk of acquiring the virus and their general state of health . there are many other examples . see above . nothing has been demonstrated that convinces me that god has been ruled out of all these issues . he probably is not active in all situations , but there ' s nothing that says he ( or even satan ) are totally inconsequential either .	0

i thought it was common knowledge that merv was gay . it may have been an opinion piece ( as are all blogs ) , but he indicated he researched these facts for a book he had written . signorile is no slouch . he is a respected writer . certainly strongly opinionated , but he backs his opinions up . this is not a fox ' news ' piece . how does telling the truth prevent the guy from resting in peace ? well , signorile certainly did not back up his opinions in this instance . how do you know it ' s the truth ? if it were definitive , i ' d be more inclined to agree . it ' s not ' common knowledge ' that merv griffin was gay , at least not outside of hollywood . i ' d never heard it myself . i do not see how you could know for certain anyone was gay that was in the closet unless they admitted to it or were seen doing something that made it clear they were ( like having sex with someone of the same gender ) . and the idea he should be hold some responsibility for not talking to reagan about aids in the 8 0 s is absolutely opinion .	0
( playing devil ' s advocate ) and , by what authority would you deny a woman ' s " right to choose " an abortion that happens to be " late in her pregnancy ? " thats a very good question . to be honest - i would prefer no legislation period - but i would not get up in arms about a late term restriction like i described because 1 ) a fetus could very well survive outside of the mom at that point , 2 ) most reputable doctors will not conduct an abortion at that stage without a legitimate medical reason anyway .	0
' most of the time ' is not good enough . killing animals is murdering members of other species and those same guns can be used and are used for killing humans . the same applies to guns used for target shooting . you can take them home , have them stolen and then used to commit a crime ; or your son can take them to school and shoot a few dozens kids . well , i am not saying a school massacre has ever taken place in the usa or canada ; do not get me wrong oswald only used his gun for hunting , did not he ? do you think banning guns would stop people who wanted them from getting them ? also you failed to address my point . is self - defense not a legitimate use for guns ?	0

' prostitution is not a victimless crime as there are child prostitutes , and the human trafficking among other things . ' the reason human trafficking if prevelent in prostitution is exactly because it is illegal . if you legalised prostitution , supply of ( and demand for ) native prostitutes will rise dramatically . do you not see that trafficking and child prostitution would actually be lowered by legalising prostitution ? ' legalization of prostitution would lead only to . <repeated> a further spread of hiv / aids . ' again , do you not see how there would actually be a reduction in sexually transmitted viruses if prostitution were regulated and legalised ? the majority of problems with prostitution are directly attributed to their illegal status . oh really xaeon ? netherlands has had prostitution legal for years and they are one of the most primary destinations for humans being trafficked . europe has many countries who have legalized prostitution but suffer from increased human trafficking . but maybe the us is different ? <url> with it legalised more people are having sex with whores , and as soon as a whore is infected she does not even know it yet , so if she gets infected with hiv she still has sex with customers up until the day her next ' check up ' is which is usually once a week . what happens to the infected prostitute ? she gets kicked out onto the street . so thats one more woman infected , and possible many more men .	0

walking around naked endangers my right to innocent thought . watching little girls in the bathroom endangers their right to privacy . gay marriage does not affect anyone other than those getting married . if you could effectively prove that two homosexuals marrying each other would harm me physically or mentally , ( and thus taking away my rights as a citizen ) , i would say you have a point . also , along the lines of what mach said , no one has the right to walk around naked . the law applies equally . same with looking at little girls naked . no one has that right . however , everyone except homosexuals have the right to marry whomever ( not whatever ) they please . only homosexuals are told they cannot marry other homosexuals . your argument is contradicting how can seeing people naked ifnringe on your personal thought and the other not ? also the right is not to marry whomever neterosexuals want . the limits apply to everyoen equally just people have different preferences .	0

i have never understood this need to call babies he or she , rather than " it " . i refered to my own daughter using " it " for the first month after she was born . it was only because my own mother objected to me doing so that i stopped . babies look like babies , not like boys or girls . it makes sense to refer to them as " it " . it also saves strangers getting embarrased when they guess the gender wrongly . refer to babies as " it " : it is not disrespectful and it ' s sensible . well i know it would not be sensible for anyone to call my child an it that is just disrespectfull to both your partener and child .	0

an example of this would be an airplane for the most part . the laws are strictly enforce although they can still be beaten . however instances of this actually occurring in a way that puts people in danger are few and far between . so yes it can work but it takes incredible measures to make it work . it appears the safety nazis feel gun free zones should be ran like prisons . maybe the safety nazis should take a field trip to their states prison system and ask the guards if guns or any other weapons ever make it into the prisons . prisons are considered gun and drug free zones . if this was true then how can an inmate get shot by a gun in prison ?	1
that is because all citizens are born here , eh ? emoticonxrolleyes where is here ? you do not seem to want to display your location . we all know there ' s more than one way to become an american citizen . that said , as an american citizen , english is the native tongue . it ' s the primary language taught in american schools and it ' s how our government communicates with its citizenry . i am not really interested in debating this topic with you , it probably should be a thread unto itself . i think dono was merely pointing out that if you want to make a ' snippy ' reply , it carries more weight when correctly spelled .	0
haha , you are too funny sometimes . i never understand why you take a topic and just randomly make a comment which is barely based on anything in this entire thread . it reminds me of kayne west going " george bush hates black people " randomly during a pledge drive . keep up the good work . are you just not bright enough to make the connection between :	1

i suggest you wait for someone to make a statement then attack / address it , rather than presuming statements that were not made and arguing against them . the tactic you are using is called ' strawman arguments ' and is not an effective debating method unkerpaulie , thank you for this explanation . boing ! eureka ! i have finally concretely grasped what a ' strawman ' argument is . creating something that does not exist . making mock , in a sense . sorry , i just have to reiterate the term in my terms to paste it firmly into place in my cranium .	0

no , but they can change laws if they are unconstitutional . them being irrelevant can however be played as a factor . not an absolute one . true , they can change laws if the are unconstitutional . so what makes a ban on abortion unconstitutional ? also , what makes the dealth penalty for minors constitutional one day and not the next ? in fact 1 5 yrs ago it wasn ' t an unconstitutional decision . i guess now it is ? <repeated> makes no sense . clive14 , those are obviously not my beliefs as i think everyone is equal . i am not sure your wealth makes you different from someone else . it means you wealth is unequal . <repeated> we are talking about just people . we all end up 6 foot under ( so to speak ) in the end .	0

proof . give me proof that ' these animals ' are the same citizens of iraq which we are attacking , occupying their homeland and adding an extra layer of tyrrany to an already terrorized , fearful country ? give me proof that shoving our fear and anger at innocent civilians is anything close to what is right or just . we replace saddam hussain with george bush and the only real difference is that gb has never once set foot inside their country . so do not give me that line that aborted fetuses are innocent in comparission . if you claim that a fetus is a life , what does it matter what type of life it is ? human life is still human life . so now name calling and accusations as to my mental health are what you concider as rational thought ? i expect that you must be some sort of expert on warfare , in paticular this war ? am i to believe that you are a soldier there now ? your rage towards me in your post only shows just how easily upset you are . i posted exactly what i meant to and you went off on a tangent . i asked you for proof and all you can do is a schoolyard tactic if ' show me yours before i show mine ?

and for decades , evolutionist fools proclaimed they had decoded the book of life … . they said that individual genes controlled individual traits . well all that came to a crashing halt when the human genome project showed that the one - gene / one - phenotype concept was indeed a fairytale . instead , to the shock and dismay of teary - eyed evolutionists , they found that the human genome only has about 25,000 genes – over 100,000 short of their estimate . this meant their theory about how they thought life worked had to be scrapped . so a theory was revised . <repeated> does that mean that it was wrong afterwards ?	0

what about other ' rational ' alternatives to your version of evolution ; such as that postulated by id theorists ? intelligent design comes in many flavors too . id that submits as a designer something that has any quality of the unknowable is irrational . id that submits we were created / designed by things inside the universe that are knowable are rational claims . however , they have no evidence , so they have a long way to go to be shown to be worthwhile to pursue . even a simple application of occam ' s razor tells us that to suspect a thousand theories on how life has changed on earth is unecessary when another theory can fulfill the description entirely , of life , and they have evidence to support it . it ' s why this theory is discarded onto the heap of any number of theories that simply is not going anywhere . you can make up a theory right now about how life began , but if it cannot be supported by evidence or is redundant to a theory already described . <repeated> why would we ?	0
in great britain the police have been arresting children for playing with toy guns . natalie and darren , both 12 , were arrested for playing with a toy gun . the uk police fingerprinted them and then threw them in a jail cell . <url> in us airports similar things are happening . “ security officers at los angeles airport have confiscated a gun in a security scare - from a plastic toy soldier . the two - inch weapon belonged to a gi joe toy - similar to an action man . ” <url> i think you got it backwards kelvin . you are the one that said you would not let your children play with toy guns because you are afraid that your children would not be able to tell the difference between a real gun and a toy gun . blindone never advocated toy gun - control . on the contrary , blindone was pointing out that toy guns do not harm children . and if your children can not tell the difference between fantasy and reality how do you expect them to handle a gun responsibly ? they might try to shoot the boogey man or their own shadow .	0

is this the sort of thing that is being taught at that bastion of liberal science , <allcaps> mit </allcaps> ? how can this be presented as fact rather than theory ? new and improved nuclear fuel creatednuclear fission , neutrons and protons , and even the atom itself are just theories . no one has ever seen an atom or a neutron . no one has ever observed an atom split . why are our liberal news media allowed to present this as fact ? moreover , are not nuclear reactors designed by intelligent humans ? i also notice that this research was funded by our hard earned tax dollars without requiring that the benevolence of god also be researched in equal time . this is yet another shameful example of the godless attitude of science . thankyou for bringing to my attention that atoms , neutrons and protons are merely scientific assumptions . now as i gaze at the night sky with all its ' bits and pieces spinning around each other i can sleep happily knowing that our solar system is not part of a housebrick afterall .	1

well , here ' s another quote from allan feduucia : " feathers are unique to birds , and no known structure intermediate between scales and feathers has been identified . " ( j . alan feduccia , the age of birds , harvard university press , 1980 , pg . 52 ) yippie doo ! a 23 year old quote from an ornithologist defending his point of view . and his point of view has ( or had ) merit . but since then , several feathered dinosaurs ( not birds ) have been found . it has also been shown that the difference between a scale and a feather may be no more than a single point mutation . ( you do know what i am talking about , do not you calli ? you do know what a " point mutation " is , do not you ? ) bottom line is that there may be no intermediate between scales and feathers . a single point mutation produces feathers from scales . various kinds of feathers require only further mutation .	1
where do you get the figure of 500,000 gay couples who want to immediately be married ? would these gay couples beat the straight couples in some kind of a race to the weddings occurring at the same time , or occurring over the course of a month or a year ? actually , i pulled the number out of the air for illustrative purposes only , but after reading the <allcaps> cbo </allcaps> report , i see that i wasn ' t far off . they predicted 600,000 gay couples would want to get married it allowed .	0

these last two cases are of course not the norm , but they indicate the wide - range of ideas that can be routinized by the judicious quoting of scientific authority . and you have just described " creation science .

that they are fairy tales is merely your conceit , as is your idea that they are delusional . they and millions like them would not consider them as fairy tales and would feel insulted by your attitude in this respect . is this a case of the truth hurting ? then i guess it would work both ways . how do you feel about ' christians ' slagging off non - believers , declaring that they will end up in hell for denying god ? conceited ? yup . could i give a toss ? nope . how do you think non - believers feel about the smugness of christians ? and it ' s not just me who thinks they are fairytales and that christians are delusional , as you well know . so why personalise it ? apart from that , a lot of us here have a thick skin . this is a debating forum , and there is little room for those with delicate sensibilities who feel insulted at the pov of others .	0

well this is what i am saying . the probability of a and b in one organism i very low . and the probability of a and b in many generations is lower than just a . actually , if you look at the example i have given , that ' s false . the probability of a in one organism may be low , but the probability of a in some organism approaches 100% as the population and the number of generations gets larger . and if a is useful and comes to dominate the population , then the probability of an ab individual appearing then also tends towards 100% . in the example above , the chance of an ab mutant occurring , if a and b are substantially useful mutations , is almost a dead certainty . it would be amazing if they did not stack . so saying that ab occurring is less likely than a is misleading at best , downright wrong at worst . behe is clearly misapplying probability theory .	0

ok , since according to your claim , god is a natural part of us and everything in our universe , you can come up with a way to test for that claim . define ' god ' that will get at least a majority agreement on . develop a test for god . find a testable statement , if proven true , disproves god . when you have those , then i will accept your claim . a majority of the planet believes in a higher power , so i allready have the majority agreement on this . how about you come up with a test to see if god doesnt exist . <repeated> well ? i am waiting .	1

i find that marc ' s notion funny that the us gov is shoving atheism down the country ' s throat , when the president is a self confessed christian and the party in power in both house ' s is the party that bible belt vote for . if the us government is trying to shove atheism down the nations throat then all those self confessed christians on capital hill must be charlatans . i love how marc is just detached from reality . i doubt he will reply to how he ' s so wrong about the cases he listed . two can not even be found on findlaw .	1

i do understand that , but equally those who are pro - life would doubtless think differently . possibly in the example you gave , but what of a very late pregnancy , one that is not an early fetus and could easily exist if a csarian for example were performed ? self - aware too is not necessarily a get - out clause . what of people in deep comas who are arguably not self - aware either ? or for that matter a baby , when does ones concept of ' self ' actually begin ? but it can be argued that the impact on the child ' s life is significantly greater than that on the parents . existance is after all pretty much the biggest impact on anyone . to be fair i am playing devil ' s advocate here really , as i am broadly pro - choice myself . i was just struck by the similarity of the arguments in ' the parents right to choose ends when it affects the child ' s life ' . . <repeated> well . <repeated> in the last decade or so we have been starving them to death . where have you been ? the arguments are very similar if you consider a fetus to be a human being . i will grant you that . in the case of your c - section question , i think the mother should have the section , but we can never compell her to do so . it would be too dangerous a precedent to contemplate .	0

a fairer comparison for science as a whole would be the inner way of thinking and knowing , as contrasted to that based on external empiricism . i think that has far more staying power . but it took a lot longer to develop . my point was that only after about 5000 years of human civilization did empiricism as science develop . religion , supernaturalism , and mythology trace back into prehistory . what we know as science did not even begin to exist until the late 1 5 0 0 s and 1 6 0 0 s . before that it was ok to do science like aristotle did - no experiment , only thinking about a logical answer . thus , heavy objects fell faster than light ones and any fool could tell that the sun orbited the earth . but science is more than an inner way of thinking . it is a process and a method for learning about the universe . it is called methodological naturalism . that is not to say the science asserts that nothing exists except what is natural . it says that science can not study the supernatural .	0

[ the law of angular momentum states that if an object breaks apart in a frictionless environment , then the fragments will all spin the same direction . yet if the universe started out as a spinning speck and exploded , then how is it that the universe is filled with exceptions where moons , planets , and even whole galaxies are spinning backwards ? ] but the law of angular momentum does not require that all parts of a spinning object spin in the same way now does it . if so then something like a rotary engine for an aircraft would not be possible !	0
1 . change the definition of a legal term , something that is done daily , to benefit a class of citizen currently discriminiated against legally and socially . a more precise term would be " broaden , " since nothing about the definition pertaining to the people currently covered by it would be affected , " diluted " or altered in any way anyone has yet demonstrated . nothing about the definition that pertains to people who already are , or can be married changes one iota . their rights , benefits , and protections remain exactly the same . the only " change " would be to other people , people who have no connection to , nor impact on , the marriages of anyone else : the gays who will marry if the legal definition is broadened to encompass them . and the only " change " in that regard will be the fact that they are encompassed by it , nothing more . no substantive aspect of the definition as it currently stands changes in the slightest . the change is not in the definition itself . it ' s in who it applies to .	0

given the following : - there is no evidence for the existence of god . - there is no evidence against the existence of god . due to the fact that there are an infinite number of false premises , and only a limited number of true premises , it is better to err on the side of skepticism . this is why the burden of proof rests on the believers . until such time this burden of proof is satisfied , the logical position is the position of skepticism . i cannot say with absolute certainty that god does not exist , but i will live my life as if that were the case until proven otherwise . wow , this was up to 6 points at one time . down - voting it without a rebuttal surely refutes it .	1
i am not going to argue with you if he does or does not . you will have to take that up with some of the people in the gay rights movement . my point is that many people who have fought for human rights claim religion as part of their inspiration , and with your all - or - nothing approach , i can only assume you ' d still condemn religion even if gets more and more gay friendly . so i find it odd you ' d even bother to indicate any distinction . i have spoken favorably of religious believers who stand up for gay rights against a tyrannical version of christianity . what more do you want ? blood ? look , i disagree with the entire concept of religion . my view is that when religious believers support something that ' s right , they do it despite their religion , because it makes sense to them on the basis of humanitarian instincts , not religious ones . maybe sometimes their religion coincides with humanitarianism . all i can say to that is i wish it would do it more often than it does in practice !	0

if i would have been alive 100 years ago , would i have opposed having evolution taught in schools ? of course i would have , because i would not have been able to forsee how the benefits that the study of microevolution , genetics , and other non controversial aspects of evolution have benefited society . chances are there are equal , undiscovered things about intelligent design that could be discovered it we would give it a chance . again , please explain what possible benefits you forsee with teaching intelligent design . please show me where it is anything than a belief . evolution was always considered science . it used the scientific method , and offered evidence for everyone to see and peer review . until the " theory " of intelligent design does that , i will always be forced to put quotes around the word theory , because it will simply be a religious belief .	0
reagan because he ended the cold war . bush , because he ' s keeping the terrorist in line . okay , at least you gave an example for reagan . i personally think the russians were on the decline long before the end of the cold war , and reagan happened to be president when they finally fell , but we can agree to disagree . for bush i hope you are joking , because it has been quite clear that his policies have more than likely created more terrorists than he has helped defeat ( not to mention the numerous other bad things he ' s done as president ) . in fact the only really good thing that came out of bush ' s presidency was that his unpopularity paved the way for obama to become president .	0

lol . that ' s silly . scientific facts keep changing , because they keep building on what is proven . the actual basis for the facts has not changed at all , merely the newest accepted idea is . as time progresses that idea is tested , tested , tested and tested again until it is proven . your statement reveals sheer ignorance as to the scientific process . the fact that some scientists totally dismiss god is proof of there ignorance of scientific method . there is growing evidence to support the existence of a supreme being , and a lot of scientists are ignorant of this fact , yet they accept theories from the quantum level wich are not proven beyond the proof of the existence of god . mayabe your mind isnt as closed as others i have spoke with on this subject . i do believe in scientific method , but i also have faith that god is out there .	0

israel , as by far the single largest recipient of us military aid , direct financial aid and trade loan guarantees is the only one that comes to mind . they are our hired gun , bought and paid for . saudi arabia , currently under islamic extremist pressure for their association with us , does pay cash for their armaments . i will agree with you on some of the things you said , but not the hired gun . america does not need to hire guns , we have our own . if what you are asserting is the case , then why would we be where we are right now . and are you saying that israel gets there weapons for free ? this is america son , nothing is free if you have not found out . and our strong ties with israel are more than likely due to the fact that they are more trustworthy than any of the arab nations , thus making a greater ally .	1

so are you are saying that because she wants an abortion she should have it ? then why are you even against abortion ? we are talking about a life here not just a fetus . i believe that everyone has a right to live . no fetus should pay the consequences because of a decision made by it ' s mother . in the year 2000 , there were 1.3 million fetus that were killed and the same amount of families were waiting for children to adopt . if you are saying that nothing is wrong if a woman needs an abortion , the you are saying she can have repeat abortions . what if a woman who has unprotected sex and knows the consequences of her actions but later decides she wants an abortion ? what is your opinion on that ? i think so too . every father should have a right to have a say when it comes to an abortion because that fetus was formed from their chromosomes and genetics . i am surprised that advocates for abortion are saying that men have no right to tell a woman how to control her body but yet they do not have a problem with the decision of the u . s supreme court in which all of the judges were men .	0

this right of privacy , whether it be founded in the fourteenth amendment ' s concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action , as we feel it is , or , as the district court determined , in the ninth amendment ' s reservation of rights to the people , is broad enough to encompass a woman ' s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy . so , the supreme court rested its decision not on the 9 th amendment as the district court had done , but chose instead to base it on the 1 4 th amendment .	0
well , i apologise to both you and ez , but i must admit i am a little biased . though this is mainly due to easy rider tending to rely a little heavily on unexplained gospel quotations as argument , without any consideration for alternative meanings or possible context . though i realise this in itself is predisposing me slightly ( maybe significantly ) to one side , i think it is important to be able to argue your point from the opponents side if you really want to convince or convert someone . as i observed earlier , you seem intent on attacking islam . why else would you devote so much energy to a thread entitled ' muhammed ' s child bride ' ? you have said it yourself , as in . <repeated> and . <repeated> howard suggested to you that you might learn something about islam by reading rumi . you asked me to quote to you from rumi ? very well . <repeated> spring is christ , raising martyred plants from their shrouds . their mouths open in gratitude , wanting to be kissed . the glow of the rose and the tulip means a lamp is inside . the wind is the holy spirit . the trees are mary . the scent of joseph ' s shirt comes to jacob . a red carnelian of yemeni laughter is heard by muhammad in mecca . and . <repeated> moses , the inner light of revelation , lit up the top of sinai , but the mountain could not hold that light .	1

first off this is not an accurate depiction of atheism . atheism does not dictate how the universe was created or what happens after death . it just says that there is no god . other than that it ' s up to you to think , use your brain . this is also why the thread title : " i do not have enough faith to be an atheist " is not accurate . all you have to do is believe that we were not created by god . it does not in any way relate to evolution , the big bang , etc . i am not sure where anyone said it related to evolution , the big bang , etc . , but i might have missed something .	0

the moral of that last story is : do not screw with baldy . that aside , where did god tell these folks to do what they did ? just curious . morals are what you make them to be . for example , ' it ' s ok to kill youths if they have insulted your prophets ' is another possible one . the ones in my joshua example ? he does not tell them , nor did i say that he told them . look at what i said : ' the morality of the old testament peoples ( god included ) is definitely questionable . ' . however , in the next chapter he does immediately reward them , by protecting them from the angry reprisals of the neighbouring villages : ' 5 then they set out , and the terror of god fell upon the towns all around them so that no one pursued them . ' note that in the other examples , god is either commanding it ( through the proxy of a speaker ) or directly doing it ( pillar of salt , bears etc ) .	0
volcanoes do more to contribute to global warming than an unchecked industrial society . toxic gases , giant ash clouds , thousands of degrees of heat being released anytime there ' s anything approaching an eruption , it ' s not a pretty picture . molten rock is not the most environmentally friendly substance you will ever encounter . so you are an expert in this like you were about the economics of sending money out of the country ? the problem with letting people like you call the shots is that you really have no idea what you are talking about . it ' s something i see in a lot of conservatives .	1
for anti - choicers , it ' s just about control and power over women . they do not care about life . ( except their own . ) i am not big on the abortion issue , but are you saying that anyone who disagrees with you is sexist and arrogant ? that ' s a tactic straight from the leftist playbook . clearly you are the one who ' s arrogant , if you can make these kinds of baseless generalizations of your opponents . is not it you who always accuses conservatives of being intolerant of people who think differently than them ? now that ' s irony !	1

in short , i think this analogy needs to be reconsidered because of one important fact : a person who is brain - dead will never recover from that state no matter how much medical treatment is given , whereas an embryo who is " brain - dead " most certainly will fully recover from that state in a relatively short amount of time if left alone . what you are talking about here is the potential <emphasis> to exist being important . i would personally also thinking that potential existence is important , but not nearly as important as an existing person . after all , unfertilized eggs and sperm also have the potential <emphasis> to become full people but no one is concerned about their loss . for many of us it is the actual mentally - existing person that is most important . for both the ' braniac " case you present and for the early term fetus , if there is no reason to kill it , then do not . however , if there is a contest between the rights of a living , existing person and the rights of either potential <emphasis> person , then i think the rights of the living person win out .	0
i suppose the correct terminology would be that g . fortis evolved a smaller beak due to competition from a larger billed recent imigrant . i suppose that we just are not subjected to the same word selection pressures this side of the atlantic . emoticonxhoho well , i did say i was being nit - picky : all i was objecting to was the way the original wording suggested that the change was occurring in order to avoid competition . assuming it was due to selection , the competition from the larger birds was the putative agent of that selection . ( incidentally , i suspect we live on the same side of the atlantic . )	0
you do not make decisions based on emotion . the only connection between morals and emotion i have ever made was that properly a persons emotions should be controlled by their beliefs on morality . you never bought something you liked ? you never went somewhere with someone you liked or went to meet them ?	1

note also this false statement from a " " survival of the fittest " is a poor way to think about evolution . darwin himself never used the phrase . what darwin said is that heritable variations lead to differential reproductive success . this is not circular or tautologous . it is a prediction which can be , and has been , experimentally verified [ weiner 1994 ] . " <url> is quite clearly wrong as darwin did use it in the 6 th ed of species . well survival of the fittest was not darwins term - although he may of used it it the later editions of the origin . the phase was actually coined by herbert spencer in 1851 . weiner could be forgiven for his statement - if he had read the first edition of the origin ( regarded as being the best version as it contains no responses to critiscsms that were levelled at the preceeding editions ) he would not have come across it under darwins name . it is moot really , as natural selection is the term that is used in this context today .	0
yes , particuarly if you understand the puns in the original hebrew . adam ( mankind ) is related to the word ( adamah ) , which means ' red clay ' . this is in turn releated to the word edom , which means ' blood ' . the word translated as ' created ' is more like the term ' formed ' , as a potter forms a piece of clay . so , if you look at it properly , we can see that genesis is saying ' god formed man as a potter forms clay out of flesh and blood ' . the word ' eve ' is the word for love . so we can also point out that ' god formed man out of flesh and blood , and gave him love for companionship . that is all without going into the political comentary about conditions between the various cultures at the time . that ' s not what the bible says . you are playing word games . what next ? numerology ? <repeated> i mean , i can play around with interpreting too . i can take ' roses are red , violets are blue ' and interpret it to mean just about whatever i want it to . let us see , roses represent love , and red is the color of blood . a key characteristic of violets is that they have small flowers , and blue means sad . so what ' roses are red , violets are blue ' is really and truly saying - and you must all bow down and accept my absolute insight into this - is that ' love is bloody awful , and people with ' small things ' are sad ' . bet you never knew that ' s what it was really saying !	1

thanks for finally admitting it . and further more , thanks for posting evidence of the gay communities bigotry and intolerance against christianity . all these people were doing was passing out tracts after paying the requested entrance fee . do not you dare ever accuse my community of being intolerant or bigoted until your community rises above it . he screamed and insulted and threw his literature at the vice president of pride . and you once again snipet and reword my posts by taking them out of context to serve your own irrational and bigoted thought process . oh and dont accuse your community ? what are you some holy leader ? get off of your self rightous high horse and get a clue ! and how is my community rising above your ' communities ' bigotry and and slander ? by having pride movements like these and standing up for ourselves .	1
i have been on the local board of education for 2 years now and have never heard the phrase " young earth creationists " in any official capacity , nor has anybody ever suggested that it be taught . of course not . that battle has already been lost . creationism is religion and it cannot be taught in a science class , even when it is called " creation science " and the data is distorted and mininterpreted . the most recent attempt by creationists in kansas on the state board ( and yes , they were yecs ) was to eliminate all requirements to teach evolution , and all references to an old earth from all curriculum standards .	0
it ' s marketing 101 . in order to sell something , you have to convince people that they need it . in order to sell religion they convince people that they need it by telling them they are going to hell if they do not buy into their religion . the more things you declare a sin , the more people will be ' guilty ' of those things , thereby increasing your customer base . i love how you broke that down , but why would anyone who feels content in their life , by into something that ' s telling them they are wrong ? it seems like they are cutting out a big portion of their market with a certain sin that harms no one .	0

well , since we do not have to treat people equally , i see nothing wrong with making all people ages 14 - 16 slaves . ( i doubt anyone will be against this anyway . ) but moreover , since we are not equal , we can make women have pregnancies and disallow abortion . right ? now obviously i think everyone is equal . personally i do not see someone that makes 1 million a year any different then someone that is homeless . i guess this explains the devaluing of like though <sad> that does not suprise me . again i am not surprised that your first reaction to the idea that people are not equal would be to enslave some and that your second idea would be to subjegate women . this reveals way too much about your nature . it ain ' t pretty . try living homeless for a year then get back to me on whether you saw yourself as equal to someone on ' 1 million a year ' emoticonxrolleyes now if the ' 1 million a year ' person gave the homeless person 1 / 2 million a year , then they would be equal , because equality is at the entre of such socialist ideals .	1

1 . i think a lot of women take take the easy way out when it comes to and abortion for the reasons i have stated over and over again . <repeated> 2 . what i said was it seems you can not pick up the newspaper these days and not see a case of where some woman has abandoned a new born baby in a trash can or dumpster . <repeated> it never use to be that way . <repeated> so you argue that for some women , abortion is the ' easy way out ' , and that those women choose to abort , take the easy way out as you say , for arbitrary reasons ? could you please reiterate these reasons here ( preferably in an enumerated list ) and explain why they should be considered arbitrary ? indeed . but we have established that supposing a higher profile in the media in no way entails an actual increase in incidents . so i will repeat the question , hearsay aside , upon what evidence do you base the assertion that more women are abandoning infants ?	0

sorry , i did swerve a bit on the original topic . the concept of the nicene and chalcedonian christian was a new concept for me and very engrossing , inasmuch as , in contrast to the aforementioned faiths , mennonites and other such anabaptists did not seem to focus exclusively on the eternal life of the believer as being the most important aspect of faith . i am inclined to believe that the desperation of one to " exist forever " is a very selfish conceit and leads to contempt for the rest of society . i do not that it ' s selfish so much as self - interested . there is a difference . most people want to live a long life . is this selfish ? the idea of an after life is merely an extension of this same idea . why do you think belief in an afterlife leads to contempt for society ?	0
emoticonxconfused i did not say that , our teacher did not show us the texas version , just jokingly told us about it . i stated earlier i am from maryland . having been raised in texas as a child and teen , with many relatives still residing there , i am surprised their educational system has not gone to the bible as its primary textbook . perhaps things have changed , but fundamentalist hypocrisy was at one time the law of the land in texas . maybe since texans are no longer served by oklahoma and louisiana bootleggers the fire and brimstone circuit has relaxed , but i ' d find that difficult to believe as religion is a very effective control technique .	0
i do not think pro - choicers in general care whether or not abortion is truly rare . if they did they would put more effort into making sure it is rare , and not just legal . i know you are talking to jessica , so i will only comment on this . it would be easier to make it rare if pro - life people were not intent on making it illegal . pro - choice people have to make it as available as possible to counter pro - life attempts to shut it down entirely . if pro - life people did not exist , then the reasonable people could work towards making abortion rare . take the current debates for example . my entire point is that it should not be illegal . that abortion should be available as a safe and legal choice ( it can only be really safe if it ' s legal ) . we spend all our time and effort debating the legality that we spend no time on creating programs to help women choose to continue their pregnancies instead of having an abortion , legal or not .	0

in other words , you think a supreme court decision should only shut down the debate if it ' s a decision you agree with . roe v . wade and heller do share some striking similarities . heller is about determining the answer to a long standing question on the nature of the second amendment , and how much gun control is legally allowed . roe v . wade is about finding legal precedent for the murder of unborn children . i see absolutely no comparison between the two .	0
for obvious reasons we christians have always been adamant supporters of civil liberties when it comes to freedom of religion . we have even managed to be consistent in this principle by not opposing the rights of buddhists , new agers , or even satanists to meet , because we realize that to do so would equally undercut our own right to assemble . perhaps the thought of undermining religious freedom sends through our minds flashes of those days when the emperor nero used to ignite christians as human torches to light the streets of rome at night . the persecutions against the early church have ingrained into our christian consciousness the incredible value of living under a government that protects the interests of religion . but in the case of civil same - sex marriage , instead of recognizing the civil rights issue at stake here , we oppose the idea , quoting bible verses and appealing to morals , nature , tradition , history , and the fear that western civilization as we know it will come crashing to the ground . all of these arguments are related , of course . they are an appeal to that part of american society in which judeo - christian values are still deeply rooted . for even in america at the dawning of the 2 1 st century , many people ' s understanding of morality and nature still reflect the vestiges of the western christendom of our heritage , as do their ideas of tradition , history and an ideal society . we do not , however , argue against civil same - sex marriage in the spirit of calm persuasion . there is desperation in our tone . there is also a great deal of fear and mean - spiritedness in our rhetoric , to the point where we even accuse homosexuals ( without much proof , i might add ) of being child molesters and sexual predators , and of seeking to corrupt our youth by recruiting them into their " lifestyle . " there are probably many people who think they are justified in having such fears , but it seems to me it is more than just paranoia that feeds our frenzy . we feel deeply threatened , for we sense that we are losing the battle . not simply the battle against homosexuals , but the battle to hang on to what we still think of as " christian america . " at one time in this country we could count on quoting a verse from genesis or leviticus before congress or the supreme court and that would be the end of the debate . no more . the consensus of common biblical values on which we had once depended is giving way to the pluralism of a postmodern society . and seeing the disastrous handwriting on the wall , we have become politically desperate , and so we lunge at the enemies of christendom with a ferocity that rivals that of even the most radical gay activists . the other articles on her website are also well worth reading : musings on christianity , homosexuality & the bible	0

i wasn ' t thinking the term ' micro - evolution ' but that does work . my point was that the idea of evolution is a gradual change over a long period of time . ( i have never head the term " macro - evolution " ( nor " micro - evolution honestly ) but i assume that ' s what it is until you suggest different . ) i guess the change in beak size is more noticeable than gradual . my point for asking the question was from the selection that you quoted . i point out what stuck out to me . <repeated> what i saw was that if the finch are evolving a smaller beak because of the larger billed " recent immigration , " than that is a fast change for when the idea of evolution is gradual change over a long period of time , unless i misinterpreted it . but then again , i think it ' s possible that " micro - evolution " does happen in some birds such as finches . it is ' change over time ' , not ' gradual change over time ' . the morphological changes tend to happen with a change in the environment . the difference between ' micro ' evolution and ' macro ' evolution is the number of steps . " macro " evolution is a bunch of ' micro ' evoltultions that add up . you have two populations that you can compare that used to interbreed , and for some reason , do not , and then you add on a few 1000 ' mircro - evolution ' events to each , they become very very different .	0
no . i will quote myself here : anything we do at this point to attempt a ' bailout ' will have a net result of putting more people in hoovervilles and eating out of dumpsters . i am advocating not trying to throw trillions of dollars at a problem that cannot be solved just by throwing money at it , thus keeping the number of hooverville dumpster divers to a minimum . this guy ' s flip - flopped more times than i can count . i am not surprised , nor will i be if he fails to follow through on his words .	0
indeed . many people do not realize that the commandment is not " thou shalt not kill , " but " thou shalt not murder . " the important question then becomes , when is killing murder ? i have no doubt that god cares for the lives of fetuses . but i also have no doubt that god cares for the lives of pregnant women . the reason i brought up the exodus passage is that it ' s often taken to establish that abortion is murder , and that performing an abortion should be punished accordingly . but the passage is not talking about abortion at all . which just leaves us with the question of when it is or is not acceptable to take a life , and the passage does not provide guidance to that general question , either . how is that conclusion derived at ? the passage is speaking to the consequences to a man who ' s actions cause the death of an unborn child . and the proscribed consequence is death according to ot law . so although the passage is not speaking to abortion at all , it is making a very clear statement regarding the value of the unborn , as it is requiring a life for a life just as for any other sentient being according to the ot law . so these arguments i get from the likes of you and iangb which argue that until a child shows mental awareness , it is not actually a person deserving of human rights is a bogus and shortsighted position according to the scriptural point of view . of that , there is no question .	0
i just read an article in discovery magazine about smashing two protons together , going near the speed of light , inside of a huge , two mile ring . the proton breaks into quarks and gluans . this experiment is being used to understand what happened when the big bang went bang . i think they are trying to understand how the protons formed the matter in the big bang . i did not read the whole article , but let me try to find it . it would be interesting to see what happens . i have always been fascinated with the big bang , and we may finally start to understand much more about it and how it happened . thoughts ? this should be in the science section , not the cve section . do not give ss any more reason to believe that the big bang is part of biology .	1
that all changed after he became a radical gun activist ! charlton heston ' s civil rights credentials are seriously sullied by his bigoted and homophobic remarks and his attacks on racial minorities . the endorsement by white supremacist david duke further threatens to erode the considerable respect many americans felt toward heston for his years - ago commitment to human rights . - julian bond , board chairman , <allcaps> naacp </allcaps> really brady . it is widely recognized that mr . heston gave away a very promising film career in order to take such an unpopular stand at that time . in fact he worked very little in films after that . i think the above statement was a political one , an anti - gun one , without much fact to back it up . i do not think a man of such principle changes his mind when all he actually work to accomplish comes to pass . but you can push your poison just as far as you want to . you have a first amendment right to do so . mr . heston would have wanted it that way !	0

i am new to the forum and was just reading through a few of the posts . i like archangel ' s line of reasoning here . to take it another step , i remember reading in high school the percentages of , what elements made up the atmosphere . o , n , and about 2% of all the other elements combined . those 2% included co2 and had a number specifically attached to it . i do not remember what that number was , but if it were ' actually ' showing measurable increases , why are we not all kept up to speed on how drastic the increases are ? [ i . e . 1970 it was 0.0123% and now it is 0.0124% ] . i also remember at university there was a big deal about an aluminum plant in southern california or maybe mexico that was constantly blowing smoke into a particular mountain range that was growing trees . so scientists started studying the ill effects of all this pollution on the trees . does anyone know what was discovered ? erm . <repeated> we are ? levels of co2 in the atmosphere are usually quoted as parts per million , currently a little over 3 8 0 ppm , 150 years ago closer to 280 . in 1970 about 3 3 0 ppm . carbon dioxide in the earth ' s atmosphere - wikipedia , the free encyclopedia	0
okay , here is how it went : god made the animals . he said , " hey , adam needs a helper .

what are the reasons which you would present behind the statement " all human life is sacred " ( or whichever similar statement you think is the core of your pro - life stance ) ? because to not view it as sacred presents a greater potential for harm . people sometimes to take a disposable view of things that they consider unimportant . to view humanity as sacred helps protect humanity .	0

the reason that ' s the case is because there are many limitations on marriage but only homosexuals claim they are being discriminated against . and if you rewind a little over 40 years , the exact same thing could be said about interracial marriage . archie ' s reply is a non - argument , and false at that . multiple other groups state discrimination in marriage , but there are <allcaps> legitimate state interests </allcaps> prohibiting their marriage . little things like child rape , lack of consent , and other issues .	0

so we have , in order of humility : agnosticism : do not know , can not know . but i have my opinion . note : many religious people and humanists alike fit into this category . theism : probably can not know , but does not realize it . my " heart / soul / essence / whatever " tells me it is truth . note : often impossible to reason with . no scientifically measurable way to prove position . atheism : can not know , but thinks and says otherwise . note : usually angry . no scientifically measurable way to prove position . you have done a marvelous job knocking down strawmen of your own construction . having offered a naive and superficial caricature of atheism , agnosticism , and theism , you then imagine a self - serving hierarchy that is , in a word , worthless - all in a silly effort to show yourself most humble . ironic .	0

no , it is you young padawan learner . <repeated> that has been mislead , some of the most famous and noted darwinian naturalists such as crick , huxley , lipson . <repeated> and others have admitted to their own discredit that the entire theory of evolutions rests on chance , here . <repeated> but here , lets burst that bubble for you a bit more : i am sure you reproduce these quotes in good faith , but you ought to know they are not necessarily what they seem . the darwin quote is a particularly craven quote mine : he was expressing empathy with those of his readers who found it difficult to imagine how such a thing as an eye could evolve by stages ; effectively putting himself in their place so that he might more readily take them by the hand and show them how such evolution may occur , with ample supporting evidence from the natural world . i refer you to the quote mine project for further edification .	0
the big problem is that most of that tax money neither goes towards the needs or the wants of the american people , and all the tax money is coming from the middle class . while the less than 5% wealthy does not pay any taxes after their tax returns . if we solved this problem then we would have more than enough money to pay for a free health care . the top 10% of people in this country pay 67% of the taxes . most of the money from the middle class ? no , not at all .	0
for this to be a consistent pro - choice argument , and assuming this to be a rightful interpretation and application of the 1 4 th amendment there would be necessary conclusions . those who hold this as an absolute belief must extend the right of a woman ' s right to choose the allocation of her bodily resources beyond pregnancy and into every instance of life . therefore the pro - choice line of reasoning that says that a woman has the right to choose to abort because she does not wish do share her bodily resources can be extended to conclude also that a newborn infant can be aborted if a woman decides not to donate her bodily resource of nutrition and she has no access to formula ( no other factors involved ) . that is an erroneous line of reasoning because it fails to take into account the myriad of other options open to a women after birth to remove the newborn from her care without any ill effects ( physically anyway ) . killing in the instance of a newborn is not justified because of those other options open to her . by contrast , a pregnant woman has exactly one option open to her to remove the fetus from her care and that is abortion . i would contend that the same line of reasoning that allows for adoption can be used here , that no one must donate their resources to a dependant . your reasoning that a woman , using the same line of reasoning that pro - choice people employ , can withhold her bodily resources " until the newborn dies " as if that is equal to withholding bodily resources in pregnancy is faulty .	0

this is pure paranoia . what evidence do you have to support you are point of view ? why do not you actually do a little research yourself . handgun control inc was founded by two victims of gun - violence . sarah brady joined handgun control inc after her husband received brain damage from a bullet . senator ted kennedy also supports gun - control because some of his family members were killed with guns . many people who support gun control have experienced the horrors of gun violence firsthand and are just trying to make our nation a safer place . it ' s not because they are power hungry . evidence , i dont need no sticking evidence . this is what i beleive , and thats it , but i will dig up some proof that supports my point .	1
george bush : ' people who want to be a citizen of this country ought to learn english , and they ought to learn to sing the national anthem in english .

read these storys of self defence and then tell me brady how you can justify thesethe injustice of the british ban on self defensemaking matters worse , the british legal system seems to treat crime victims worse than it treats the criminals who attacked them . an example is the tony martin case : tony martin was a farmer , whose remote farmhouse had been broken in to many times . martin feared future burglary attempts and the risk of being attacked by a violent burglar . when a pair of burglars broke in while he was home , martin opened fire with a pump action shotgun . the 16 - year - old burglar fred barras was killed , and 33 - year - old brendon fearon was wounded in the leg . later on that day , the police arrested tony martin and charged him with the crimes of murder and wounding with intent . at trial , martin argued that he had acted in self defense , but the court found that he had fired while they were trying to flee . he was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison , although the conviction was later reduced to manslaughter with a 5 year sentence . the surviving criminal , who had over 30 criminal convictions , then sued tony martin for the injury he suffered during the burglary . the parole board refused to grant tony martin an early release because he “ has shown no remorse and would continue to pose a danger to any other burglars . ” martin was eventually released from prison after spending years in prison and being vilified by the anti - gun groups in the uk for shooting criminals who had broken into his home . another example , from 2009 , also shows how the british legal system favors criminals over their victims : a millionaire businessman has been jailed for attacking a man who held his family hostage in their own home – while the criminal went free . munir hussain , who was threatened at knifepoint and tied up by a gang of masked men in his living room last year , was told he must go to prison for 30 months to preserve “ civilised society ” . but walid salem , a criminal with more than 50 convictions , was handed a two - year supervision order for his role in the break - in at an earlier hearing . he was one of three men who ambushed mr hussain , his wife and children as they returned to their home in high wycombe , bucks , on sept 3 last year after attending ramadan prayers at their local mosque , reading crown court heard . their hands were tied behind their backs and they were forced to crawl from room to room before being forced to lie down in the living room . but when hussain ' s teenage son managed to escape and raise the alarm , he seized his chance and turned on his captors . . . the brothers were found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent by a jury in september . sentencing , judge john reddihough told them it was his “ public duty ” to jailing munir hussain for 30 months and his brother for 39 months . this one is quite nice as wellcleared : builder who chopped off thug ' s ear with samurai sword after he threatened to rape and kill his family | mail onlinewell thank god for the gun ban in england . it has completely wiped out all crime meaning no citizen ever needs to defend themself . when the criminal has greater civil protections than his victim , and this is viewed as being civilized , a society is doomed .	0
the only stupid gun laws are the laws that arent strict enoughlike the law that gun nuts wanted that would allow children to tote around assault rifleshow stupid can you be what laws are these that you speak of ? kindly provide the bill name and number so you have some actual proof and are not simply parroting from the fear - mongering brady campaign and violence policy center . during world war ii the american people rounded up japanese - americans and herded them into concentration camps because you were at war with the people of japan and thought that they were the sleeping enemy even though they had no proof . what you are speaking of is no different than this . the way i see it brady , your hatred for guns and gun owners is so overwhelming and logic defying , that you ' d be perfectly alright with unleashing a life - ending pandemic plague on the people of earth if you believed it would put an end to all gun owners everywhere .	0

what ' s the point of posting a bunch of propaganda from some biased website ? your whole post proves nothing because it does not show a causal relationship between gun control and mass murder . how come sadam hussein was able to kill so many of his subjects although gun ownership was common among the iraqi public ? i suppose we could find a way to blame all the world ' s problems on gun - control . even this pro - gun website admits that you can not blame the holocaust on gun - control . " the simple conclusion is that there are no lessons about the efficacy of gun control to be learned from the germany of the first half of this century . it is all too easy to forget the seductive allure that fascism presented to all the west , bogged down in economic and social morass . what must be remembered is that the nazis were master manipulators of popular emotion and sentiment , and were disdainful of people thinking for themselves . there is the danger to which we should pay great heed . not fanciful stories about nazi ' s seizing guns .

a homophobe according to websters dictionary is one who has an intense dislike or fear of homosexuals . if someone is opposed to gay marriage and does not dislike gays or fear them , just not wanting to extend marriage to gays they would not be a homophobe . one can be opposed to gay marriage and not intensely dislike gays or fear them . why do you oppose gay marriage ? the traditional definition of marriage is as a contract for the purchase of a bride . the wedding is what is sacred . what you are doing is no different than those who opposed marriage betwen people of different races or beliefs as well . you have no valid reason to oppose it either .	0

apparently gay marriage is more threatening than unmarried gay couples are . the point about legalizing gay households is certainly puzzling unless one contends that cohabitation is illegal ( which it is not ) . but just in case i am wrong , perhaps the authorities should be notified of all the heterosexual unmarried couples and they should be hauled off to jail . oh cc , apparently , 10% of the population has the power to destroy the other 90% somehow . we can not be in the military because we have the power to undermine things , we can not get married cause we will destroy marriage for everyone , we cannot possibly have committed relationships because it would make britney look bad ( although , i have her beat by 4 years and counting , still happy and going ) we have the power . we are gay , ten percent taking out the other 90% or so they say ( ask jaaman for more info )	1

for faith has no merit where reason has proof from experience . ( my evidence does not require this quote , it ' s for comparison only ) the theory of evolution is based on evidence , the existence of god , is not . <repeated> reason cannot be applied to it . furthermore , since evolution relies on reason , faith cannot be applied to it . to attempt to label science as a faith is a contradiction . i know it irks you that your faith cannot be proven , but that ' s the definition of faith ! <repeated> it would not be faith without it . as montalban says in a contradiction of motives : his particular faith does not rest on the foundations of [ reason ] . why then look for support from reason ?	0
1 . you cannot legislate the poor into prosperity , by legislating the wealth out of prosperity . 2 . what one person receives without working for , another person must work for without receiving . 3 , the government cannot give to anybody anything that the government does not first take from somebody else . 4 . you cannot multiply wealth by dividing it . 5 . when half of the people get the idea that they do not have to work because the other half is going to take care of them , and when the other half gets the idea that it does no good to work , because somebody else is going to get what they work for , that my dear friend , is the beginning of the end of any nation . odd . i can not seem to find any racial slurs or racist ideology in those sentences . in fact , i do not see any race or races in general even mentioned . you are just one of those people who thinks you can win a discussion by accusing your opponents of being racist . sorry simone , but in the real world , people can disagree with your leftist views ( which are barely existent ) without being racist .	1

again , i do not think anybody will argue that owning a gun prevents crime . the reason for having a gun is as you stated - to stop the crime once it has begun ( though this may prevent a worse crime from occurring ) . i think some people will and have argued that . i will work on finding a quote , but i believe it was somebody here who argued that , because of the recent scotus ruling , home invasion in dc would decrease because criminals would be more worried about encountering a homeowner with a gun . you do have a point about preventing a worse crime from occuring , though .	0
i am talking about god in general , but since you mention it i am reasonably sure that christians , jews , muslims and ( possibly ) hindus are worshipping the same god . even if we just take the abrahamic religions we are still looking at about 2 / 3 of the world ' s population . that ' s an interesting observation . by what means are you reasonably sure ? do you think the other religions have the same take on it as you do ? i used to think the same : if there is only one god , then they had to be worshipping the same , just giving him different names . then i was introduced to matt . 7 . clearly god only wants identifying ( ex . 6 <happy> , 15 <happy> etc . ) and worshipping one way , therefore all other religions have to be wrong . just a thought .	0
the topic did not change . the topic was the reasons for the french no vote which certain posters originally claimed was a vote against chirac , and when i asked them to back it up with evidence . the only ' evidence ' they could cite was that commentators said that , so it was so . when i said that i heard commentators saying that turkey and fears of globalisation were the main reasons for the french no vote , then the same posters who had earlier claimed that the french no vote was a vote against chirac now changed their tune and said turkey and fears of globalisation were reasons as well . so please keep with the thread of this disucussion will you . i know its hard work for you but try to remember how this topic got started in the first place . french like turkeys even the yanks eat turkeys . what has a turkey got to do with the french voting no ! by the way , why do you spell turkey with a capital t ?	1

i can well believe orion saying that you used a source that said the rabbi ' s condoned pedaphilia , and denied the holocaust . did you go to college , trebor ? you might want to look up how " pedophilia " is spelled . <allcaps> lol </allcaps> ! <repeated> then you can go have a beer with orion and watch his head swivel .	1
and it also took an amendment to give the slaves rights , not a judge . and it will , i guess , take an amendment to deny rights to and make a whole segment of the population second class citizens .	1

in other words youre happier because the old man did something criminal and broke the law . admit it . so the old man was doing something criminal by carrying a firearm for self defence ? the bar***d <censored> ! how can you do such a thing , breaking the law like that , or maybe if the criminal who beat him up was the one who actually deserved to be charged , or better shot . so you think that this man who was following the law ( texas case ) deserved to go to jail for defending his property and anybody else who may have been hurt , killed as a result of their next crime ? are you actually insane ? have you lost your marbles ? what is wrong with you ?	1
what are you suggesting ? speak plainly please . insults by implication are cowardly . seriously , in part is waxy saying , i was here first ? ( it ' s my forum , i will whine if i want to . )	1
in a socialist nation , the government issues identity cards to all its citizens , to ensure " national security " . anyone suspected of wrongdoing can more easily be rounded up and imprisoned than in a free society . in a socialist nation , the government is the most important entity in determining whether an individual or group of individuals is prosperous or not , if a business is suspected of having links to terrorism , abortion , islam or political opponents , funding can be cut , ensuring high moral standards are maintained throughout the land . in a socialist nation , the government funds schools and determines their curriculum - ensuring that all students learn the appropriate facts rather than controversial theories , ensuring the stability of the governing regime . in a socialist regime the head of state is held to be deserving of respect and admiration from his subjects , ensuring a stable rule - those opposing actions taken by the government are regarded as " unpatriotic " and " appeasers " . in this way it is easy for a socialist nation to wage war and ensure foreign nations have friendly governments , where a less socialist government may not have the funding to maintain a high - tech global police force . i think you are mixing up socialist and fascist . patriotism is anathema to socialism .	0
i do not think the lightning strike will be proven it is merely plausibe . i think it goes something like that . scientists have tried to repeat what they believe happened , but to no success . anyway , atheistic evolution says that there is no intelligence , the scientists who were trying to repeat what may have happened have intelligence and they made many such measurements to try and create life from lifeless chemicals - in other words , the experiment was already logically flawed !	0
that ' s not true according to the textbook claim : " before the industrial revolution , most <emphasis> of the moths were light <emphasis> . this was because the dark <emphasis> forms resting on light tree - trunks were more easily spotted , and thus eaten , by birds . when pollution darkened the tree trunks , the light <emphasis> forms then had less camouflage , so they were preferentially eaten by birds , and the dark <emphasis> forms became dominant in the population . actually , it is quite correct . you misunderstand . the text book was trying to make it simple so that you would understand . the text book wasn ' t simple enough . the first record of carbonaria was in 1848 . the discussion you quote was trying to explain quite simply , so that you might understand why the change took place . there is no record of anyone ever seeing a carbonaria before 1848 . it is probably a safe assumption that an occasional mutation caused some to be born from time to time , but they were not able to reproduce to the extent that they were ever noted before 1848 .	0

i find that laughable . is the state infalliable ? i disagree . at least 23 have been executed innocently , with rates likely much higher . <url> how about the 69 released death row inmates ? are you saying that in the past no one has been wrongly executed when we are now seeing dna and other tech freeing inmantes basically every 2 months ? an innocent person can be convicted of a crime - - i thought that was what the topic was about . just because they are convicted , does not mean they are 100% responsible , guilty , etc for that crime - but if they are convicted then in the eyes of the judicial system - - they are guilty . that is why these innocent people are put in prison for 20 years - - they are convicted of a crime . i was trying to say that with dna used in forensics , then maybe the dna study blood stain other than the victims might save a person from going to prison on circumstantial evidence . okay , everytime i make a post i get my arse jumped on - - what is it with you people ? like i said , if the person is not convicted , then they will not be murdered in the electric chair , or by lethal injection . comprende ' ?	0

i am really not so sure about obama ' s healthcare plan , when i read it it seems kind of wishy - washy . <repeated> # like what does " reform the insurance market to increase competition by taking on anticompetitive activity that drives up prices without improving quality of care . " actually mean ? # in practice ? # i am more interested in the health care for america plan more , it ' s a proposal put together by the political scientist jacob hacker with the support of the economic policy institute . i ' d suggest reading thinking big to get a better idea of the plan , but the basic idea is that employers pay money into a public fund , enough to cover their workers . # the public fund should have quality coverage for all , including preventive care . # workers get to choose - keep your insurance , choose a different private plan , or join a public health insurance plan without a private insurer middleman , pick your healthcare providers and doctors . # employers choose too . those who prefer not to shoulder the burden of providing coverage as good as the law requires can decide to enroll their workers in the public plan at a modest cost . # <allcaps> hcfa </allcaps> and medicare would function as a single nationwide insurance pool covering close to half the population . so basically either the public plan attracts most americans , and our system gradually evolves into single - payer or because the floor prevents a race to the bottom , the public - private competition raises the bar on care and efficiency , improving quality and cutting costs , even in the private insurance plans . # the standards would be kept by a strong government watchdog . # what do you think ? i think you are on to something . the problem i see is that any proponent of a plan such as this will have toi take on both the health insurance lobby and the pharma lobby and their bottomless well of $$ $ and propaganda . here ' s hoping now that there ' s a new sheriff in town .	0

alrighty , before everyone jumps on me with hurtful words . heh . i ' d like to just give you my opinion on this matter . < 3 emoticonxangel first to bat , i am not against the gay person , i am not homophobic i am against the homosexuality . i do not think gay people should be damned to hell , put in jail , or any of that stuff . that ' s absurd . what i do think , is that marriage is unity between a man and a woman . the ok <emphasis> for sex , and personally i believe it ' s origin is biblical . emoticonxlove jesus freak ^ . vemoticonxzzz <elongated> a gay person is a homosexual , friend . he can not change that part about himself . he was wired that way . if you do not like the idea of gay sex , then i ' d suggest you not participate in gay sex . that ' s pretty simple . if you do not want gay marriage , then do not get one .	1

yeah a decent looking guy with a big gun . <repeated> yes it ' s a joke lol . but seriously that gun was such a treat it ' s so simple to clean , reliable and accurate in the right hands . no wonder the military is having such a pain trying to find a successor . <repeated> seems all the drills would broadcast when they had a leftie . just could wait for that case of m - 1 thumb or the hot one down the shirt .	1
do not they get that the whole pro - choice movement is based in a desire to make sure that ever child is a wanted child ? wow , i think this is the first time i have ever heard anyone claim that the pro - choice movement is for the sake of the child . sorry , you are not even close . i do not know a pro - choicer period that would say it ' s for anything other than the sake of the woman .	0

i think you , the barbarian , and close_slave_can are basically asking the same question . the problem is , you are all trying to look at these predictions through the lense of the evolutionary paradigm . well , the question i am asking is for you to provide a valid scientific prediction based on creationism .	0
ok according to the bible god only created the first two beings , adam and eve . now christians dont rule out science , and science has shown that we produce offspring . god has created these offspring but not directly . think of photosynthesis , we eat meat , this is getting energy from the sun indirectly . so we have shown that we ourselves produce offspring but we are put here and given the abbility by god to produce offspring . as far as your question on why god alows addicts to have babies it can be explained as this . we where given the freedome of choice to decide if we want to be an addict , wrong put we have the choice . god created us to have that choice , or else we would be robots . the bible also says god knows everything yet to come , so he new that this particular person would become an addict and have baby . god can stop this put he doesnt interecpt dirrectly with our choices . so god already knows if a particular person will become an addict ? that does not leave much free choice for that person , does it ? if i go to a restaurant and god already knows i am going to choose the poached salmon for my entree , then i do not have much choice in the matter , do i ? omniscience and free will are mutually exclusive . if god is omniscient , then we are indeed ultimately robots . deluded with the perception of free will , but robots none the less . unless of course , god is so omnipotent that he can know everything and still allow free choice . but then reason , logic , and thought become delusional . sounds like a loose / loose situation to me .	0
people do not like to be cheated . they do not like to be victims of fraud . if economic systems are not governed and regulated , people can be victimized by the systems . and if they are governed and regulated people can be victimized by the system . in fact , the regulation might be the very thing victimizing people . again , it is not the system but the people who are in society that make a morality .	0
so why did toe ignore horizontal gene transfer for so many decades ? can you tell me how it is that gene transferred horizontally ( without going through selection ) validates darwinism , which says all beneficial traits must pass through selection in order to be adapted ? it did not because it was not clear till the 1 9 7 0 s that horizontal gene transfer was something to be considered . nobody knew the mechanism till that era . and of course hgt is just another form of variability to be taken into account . genes transfered horizontally are as subject to selection as anyother form of gene . once intergrated into the recieving genome they are simply one more heritable element and if they alter the phenotypes ( many are either neutral or even inactivatee ) then of course they are subject to selection . why do you think otherwise ? remember that horizontal transfer is a rare event roughly on a par with ordinary mutations .	0
further more , on what basis can we study the world in any coherent way and come to sensible conclusions about it ? why so many claims in opposition ? i make a single claim , that can be refuted through logic , if it ' s fallacy . but the claim is correct . this new claim is an interesting one that i have seen others use . i will tell you on what basis . based on reason . to hold that nothing can be known for certain , is ultimately reduced to absurd unintelligble nonsense . i will start a thread about this claim , it ' s a hot topic to be sure !	0

i agree completely . these christians make up their mind that something is in the bible and whatever it says is what it says . it is so hard to change their opinions . you know why ? because god touches our hearts like nothing you have ever felt before . it is amazing	0
' the ' hocus pocus ' approach to magic is childish ' the way she finds the spells is actually quite creative . the spells are in latin and mean things like ' shoot ' or blast ' . i think expelliarmos means to expel ( get rid of ) arms ( weapons ) . childish ? i think not . oh really , a combination of the words expel and arm mean to expel arms ? wow , she was a creative genius ! i think what he meant was rowling just takes all the stereotypical magicy stuff and mashes it all together into a tacky and overused paste .	1
the term ' bear arms ' usually referred military service at the time of the writing of the second amendment . this is evident from the first draft of the second amendment in which james madison states , ' no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person . ' although the pro - gun lobby likes to equate ' bearing arms ' with carrying a gun , to james madison the term meant ' to render military service . ' lastly , what arms were they founders referring to ? muskets , not machine guns , semi - automatic assault rifles nor uzis . obviously , using the second amendment to oppose laws regulating such weapons is highly questionably . " cases v united states , 131 f . 2 d 916 ( 1 st cir . 1942 ) , cert . denied sub nom . , velazquez v . u . s , 319 u.s. 770 ( 1943 ) . basically , the us curcuit court upheld that the second amendment did not apply to weapons that could not be carried by an individual .	0
first off the single common ancestor model has no demonstratable mechanism for how it is even possible . for another thing no substantive reasoning that all scientists use is empirically testable which is why subjective / objective duality is the philosophy of natural science . there is only a need to discern between the substantive reasoning ( theoretical ) and empirical testing ( demonstrative ) . objectivism is based on substantive reasoning just like scientific positivism or natural selection for that matter . none of these things are subject to peer review since there is a distinction between subjective and objective reasoning . * * * * * * * * . utter fraking * * * * . scientists have already accumulated mounds of evidence which suggest the common ancestor . you choose to ignore it as do most scientifically ignorant christians .	0
question : what scientific criteria was employed to determine how long ago the cretaceous period ended ?

here they take one of two national college entrance exams , act or sat . most midwest colleges take act scores and most eastern schools want sat scores , so most kids i know take both . do they conver the same types of subject ? i have , as yet , not heard much ' good ' about american education ( nor health ) , so it ' s interesting to hear about these things from the horse ' s mouth ( so to speak ) .	0
ending a life that would grow into a toddler , a child , an adolescent , and an adult - - basically the action of killing someone . god , this has been argued against a thousand times . by this deffinition masterbation is killing , menstration is involentary manslauter . by this deffinition you kill someone every time you walk by a carrot without eating it .	1

as for the extremely rare case where a womans life is at risk because of the baby and she has to choose between herself or the child which could result in possible death for both . who am i to say what decision she should make . that is a horrible thing for someone to have to choose . i do know , however , that my wife almost died during pregnancy and right after pregnancy because of the baby and she would have never chose herself . i take it that you are not educated about maternal mortality in pregnancy , then ?	1
here in new hampshire , not known as a bastion of liberalism , civil unions passed the state legislature this year . i am now covered under my partner ' s state sponsored ( he ' s a state worker ) health insurance . we are grateful . and this is a terrific breakthrough . my partner and i are coveered by my company ' s health insurance , and the state of connecticut honors our civil union . that being said , i still have to pay tax on my partner ' s health insurance as imputed income because the federal government refuses to acknowledge our union . so it has to be marriage . full and without exception . civil unions are not enough when we are treated differently under the law .	0
for your info , and as i stated before , this world will not last much longer in its current state . that ' s why the book of revelation gives me such hope . the redemption of mankind will be completed , sin and its curse will be gone , and i will be able to see the god of all creation . wow , you are high on christ . <repeated> scary . <repeated> i have not seen this addiction up close emoticonxrolleyes	1
i disagree . well maybe technically . let us look at it this way . criminals ' access to guns may even go slightly up , because there are <allcaps> some </allcaps> criminals who may not want to obtain a handgun illegally . but the access of innocent citizens will go up way more than yes , but i think you missed my point . i stated this above , remember the prohabition ? people actually drank <allcaps> more </allcaps> alchohal . without a ban , law abiding citizens and criminals will have them , with a ban , there will be just criminals .	0

the proof is in the pudding . <repeated> i suggest that you read my post again and let me know if you disagree with any of my opinions . if not , then you have to come to the conclusion that god does not exsist . <repeated> god ' s only exsistance in the minds of believers just as was the case with believers of different gods throughout human history . i do not understand what you are referring to when you said , " just admit you are a faith based preacher , as bad as any fundamentalist " ? by the way it should be ovious that i am an atheist . symbiote seems to have had a large hair across his butt .	1
oh , it ' s obviously satire . it ' s just not that funny . something about it does not scan well - i think it ' s because the ' voice ' is not developed enough to make it sound absurd . that ' s the difference between liberals and conservatives ( <allcaps> aka </allcaps> " real americans . ) conservatives have a sense of humor . liberals do not .	1
i am sure you are right , but then again , they are also disageeing with countless other people on that point as well . so , i guess in your view , educating people against prejudice and intolerance is a bad thing .	1
it ' s more than likely the trinity that ' s referenced in genesis 1:26 , etc . that ' s the father , son , and holy spirit for those of you who live in yorba linda . you are the spiritual dwarf who ' s confused . perhaps you should humble yourself and get some godly wisdompartly right . the dinosaurs were long dead before the flood . your latest reach , however - that the bible stole the flood account from another culture is another one of your unfounded liberal myths . it ' s more probable that the other culture ( s ) stole it from the descendants of noah in the first place . as for xcaliber ' s tourette syndrome rant about having to go to australia to pick up koala bears , god does not need to do that . it ' s biblically - based in acts 8:39 that he can just " translate " the animals from australia to the middle east . that ' s assuming the flood involved australia in the first place . strange , i thought it was supposed to be a global flood that wiped out all of man except the chosen few . that would be ' involving australia ' one assumes .	1
since evolution can not prove the book of genesis ( ancient history ) false , and creationism does have some historical backing , they are comparable and they directly conflict . only those ignorant of science and evolution think that " evolution " has anything to do with the bible . i guess that ' s because creationism is an attempt to pretend that mythology is somehow scientific and makes silly statements about science . it seems that science is somehow anti - bible in that case when science debunks ignorance .	1
<allcaps> but </allcaps> along come a man - made invention that allows those certain portions to live on which otherwise would have died . in once case - nylon , the other , the artificial heart . you call this evolution . just helping something live does not affect evolution unless it affects the ability to reproduce viable offspring . if there was no nylon before the 1 9 4 0 s and there is an organism that can survive by eating <allcaps> nothing </allcaps> else , what does that tell you ? there could not have been a population of nylon - eating bacteria before 1940 . this is a new population that did not exist before .	1
yes , i was a fetus , and at that point in time i was <allcaps> not </allcaps> technically a human being . i had the potential to become a human being but i wasn ' t not one . i was human cells dividing . so you are claiming that you " transformed " from part of your mother to a human . so you are claiming that you were once almost your mom ' s arm or leg ? lol ! biologically , this is simply a farce statement .	1
there is a teleology in the universe , but it ' s far more subtle and pervasive than you seem to think it is . could you perhaps define " teleology " as you understand it and say why you believe there is teleology in the universe ?	0

oh joy a sob story about poor life choices and lack of free denistry . so baby how about those poor folks in britain pulling their own teeth because of lack of healthcare ? get real . i typically do not read antonia ' s propaganda pieces , so is she holding up the uk as a shining example of dental health ? if so , i suggest that she ask a typical brit to smile , so she can see for herself the folly in such an assertion . the us ' " bubbas " have better teeth than the average brit . emoticonxrolleyes	1
i am not sure what you mean . your quotes from dictionaries certainly give no indication of any blurring . i will give you another definition acceptable to biologists . natural selection is the process by which organisms well adapted to their environment survive to produce offspring while those more poorly adapted may not . in this way , particular combinations of genes are propagated differentially . and how does this compare to your ideas on artificial selection ?	0
originally posted by simone i rather think that the incidence of abortion is far lower in europe owing to their higher standards of sex education and access to contraception without the impeding hypocrisy of american religious culture . simone is quite right . <repeated> women will no longer breed to order according to the dictats of outdated religion . british muslim women will follow at some point ( many already are ) . there are a few hothead extremists who sit on london street corners with placards stating that " uk will be islamic " , " sharia law for uk " etc . etc . but those nutters are ignored along with all the other ( non - religious ) nutters currently walking the streets of london . ( for the record , muslims make up 2.1 per cent of the total united kingdom population . they are hardly " taking over " ) . " muslims are taking over the world " is a poor excuse of a reason to be anti - abortion and shows desperation , <allcaps> imo </allcaps> !	0
hey easy , ive got a question for you , which i think you probably have answered a million times before . what right do you have to dictate how people spend their lives ? in america it ' s called free speech . if anyone here there , or elsewhere in america does not like free speech , and does not like a debate forum where the word of god is found , then they can go whine to their mothers ( yo mama ) .	1

you are full of it . go back and reread my posts , including the one with biblical verses . and , to put an exclamation point on jesus and the constitution , it was dated in ' the year of our lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty seven . ' that ' s right . not the lord , but our lord ! there he is - jesus in the constitution ! <repeated> chew on that , o flatulent one ! so you are saying that this country is based on principles of judaism ? that is a date , dummy . it is not a founding principle . it was how dates were done . and ' our lord ' could have been mohamed for all you know , except that it was the standard for dates . no christian principles . so at least you admit that you can not give a single location and that you can not even tell me how many times god , jesus , and religion are mentioned .	1

his reference to marxism is to say that nazi germany wasn ' t <allcaps> communist </allcaps> in that it did not promote <allcaps> public ownership </allcaps> of the <allcaps> means of production </allcaps> as the <allcaps> ussr </allcaps> and <allcaps> china </allcaps> did at the time . are you completely unaware of the difference between communism and socialism ? do not the socialist countries around the world today allow private ownership of businesses ? while at the same time , right now , are not we seeing our own government promoting increased regulations in overseeing the control of these corporations , just as hitler did in germany ? statism is just another word for , and synonym for the definition of socialism . here is what statism / socialism has done today to the worlds economy . archie , the only way you can possibly come to that conclusion is by literally ignoring everything the author says , every accepted definition of the words socialism , statism , capitalism , fascism and nazism . if we ignore everything the author says and make up our own definitions for those words , it <allcaps> still </allcaps> does not work because the argument is <allcaps> still </allcaps> illogical and you look like a dishonest fool making it . face it . you got pwned . are you really not bright enough to recognize that ?	1
i do not know what you would call it . you use a variety of english i am not familiar with . perhaps dna contains just ' codes ' , ' facts ' or ' blueprints ' ? since you insist on defining words in extremely odd ways , i have no idea what you ' d term an undesigned , complex , self - replicating system . emoticonxrolleyes read your own links . even the creationist websites you cite do not support your exceptionally ignorant claims . at least it is clear now where you have stolen your ideas about information . you have taken a rather shady piece of creationist work , digested it poorly , and spewed it out on this forum . living things do not neccessarily contain dna . fantasy , fairy tale , wild imagination , adsurd , silly , ridiculous , fabricated . unsupported by one single observation or experiment , unsubstantiated . i do agree we do not speak the same language . no one will explain to me how one steals public information , i am confused . how is work shady ? how would you define shady as opposed to rather shady when it refers to work ? i thought bookmaking etc . was shady but i am old fashioned i guess . please educate me . is this a meaningfull reprimand coming from someone who believes one can observe a mind ? you still have refused to explain that and i was so anxious to hear it . please go on .	0
i agree to the fllest extent . ' white ' is only a color metaphor . in reality , the people in europe are comprised from 12 different ' races .

although it must be noted that some percentage of the weapons that were not traceable could well have come from north of the border as well . then there ' s the weapons we were not asked to trace . do we know where those came from ? in truth , the actual percentage of weapons in the hands of gangs and cartels that originate in the u . s . will likely never be known . how many u . s . prosecutions will result from even the 17% ? will that be dealers or ' straw purchasers ' ? now lets add one more wrench into the anti - gun works ! when the american people read , 90% of weapons come from the u . s . they are led to think , bought in an american gun store . something even sinjin apparently believes as well . however , doing some research , i found this april 19, 2005 report that tells how u . s . weapons can end up in mexico and be things that the citizen cannot buy in a gun store . why ? because they came from the u . s . government , dea and the cia . military grade weapons . now how many can be traced back to legally purchased u . s . weapons ? central america : the farc , the contras and the flow of weapons america ! get the picture now ?	0
an example , consider the cold environment mentioned above . we take a population of both long , short and medium , haired dogs to this environment . over time , very short time , the population will only consist of the long haired dogs as the short and medium haired dogs would freeze and be wiped out by the cold conditions . are you sure ? what about animals that had a combination of both long and short hair . such fur would function more efficiently as insulation that either long or short alone .	0

if the laws of logic are human constructs then how can they be absolute since humans think differently and often contradictorily . if they are produced from human minds , and human minds are mutually contradictory , then how can the constructs be absolute ? therefore , the laws of logic are not human constructs . very true . logic exists whether people are there to grasps its concepts or not . where we disagree is at your assumption that god created logic . how can this be ? logic is not contingent on any intelligent entity , whether it be man or god , to exist . the logic of increasing a quantity by adding to it would remain whether god existed or not . you have yet to tie the existence of logic to god as its cause	0

for once i find myself agreeing with randomdude . i have been in a church of several christian denominations and never seen a ' holy ' bible that was just the nt . i have never been to a church where all the sermons are drawn exclusively from the nt . and i know that most christians embrace things like the ten commandments , which are ot all the way . the ot is a prelude , it sets a backstory for the coming of christ , but things depicted in it ( like original sin ) are essential to the message of jesus ; without the ot , the nt is baseless nonsense - well , more than it is already , anyways . well , i own a new testament ( only the new ) book myself . so i am really surprised that you have not seen one before . <repeated> but whatever . what i am saying , and what random dude seem to not get , is that christianity is based on the new testament . we believe in both books . <repeated> but when people ask , what is a christian ? a christian is a person who believes in jesus - jesus only exist in the new testament - therefore if the new testament did not exist , then christianity would not exist either . so that is why christianity is based ( remember the word based ) on the gospels .	0

homosexuality can be cured and that studies show that long - term , monogamous relationships for homosexual couples are unlikely . the success rate for reparative therapy is about one - third , about the same as the success rate in other psychotherapy . there are not two kinds of people homosexual and heterosexual , there are two kinds of people heterosexuals who know that they are heterosexual and heterosexuals who dont know that they are heterosexual . there is no scientific evidence of a homosexual gene or any of the other politically correct explanations of homosexuality . the actual fact is that long - term relationships are almost non - existent among homosexuals . studies show the number of couples who are able to maintain fidelity for longer than five years is zero . there is much evidence of long - term relationships for gay couples ( that do last more than five years ) . <repeated> <url> <url> <url> <url> being gay is not an illness , so it cannot be cured . that is not true , as joe pointed out , and has been pointed out over and over again in this forum . sounds like a closet case trying to convince himself to be straight , or a guy who expects every woman to want him . therefore what we are talking about , does not exist ? give me a break .	1

abortions hurt much more than they heal . not just phsyically ( side effects can occure months afterward ) but psychologically as well . guilt , depression , so forth . in my view , abortion is murder , one way or the other and rare extreme cases do not justify its legality . even the rape victim gets a better chance than the baby does . they are at least alive while they kill their baby . that in itself will eat at the person for years until they find some way of forgiving themselves . i believe these testimonies to be real , and i feel sorry for those victims who feel obligated because of family relations ' reputations to kill their own child . it really is sad . what i have been saying here , and after awhile - the guilt , depression , etc - will get buried , deeper & deeper - but no negative / damaging experiences leave people . they stay quietly in the background - computer base - until , as you said : hopefully , the person " finds some way of forgiving themselves " , right . but what about in the mean - time ? - and we know , from research & quite a number of healers , that rot ( inside a person ) is damaging . <repeated> and often in very unsuspecting ways . much better to life benevolently , in the first place . annie	0

their beliefs are fanciful . we might as well give credence to murray the mystical eeel as having created the earth and the universe . it ' s unparsimonious . you do not need absolute proof for something to be valid . there is no credible proof for creationism , and evolution is the <allcaps> only </allcaps> other viable , parsimonious explanation . just because you do not hold the same beliefs as we do , does not invalidate our belief . i feel sorry for you if all you have to believe in is a small petri dish of algae . you do need absolute proof if your going claim it as the only possible way of creation .	1
the violinist argument : this was brought up in the ' i think abortion is ok to an extent ' thread . personally i do not believe in an absolutely rights - based system , but i am interested in this in terms of the arguments used and whether they are logically sustainable . the counter arguments put forth by its critics do not defeat the violinist arguments , at the very least . whether one accepts the argument anyway is another story <tong>	0

wrong again , christianity is definately exclusive ( john 14 : 6 ) jesus did say ' come ' but it must be on his terms ( repentance ) ephesians does indeed talk of salvation through faith created in christ jesus unto good works ( 2:10 ) . i must admit that im not totally sure what this means , that faith leads to good works ? id dispute that . whilst most of romans does talk of salvation through faith , romans 2 : 6 says however god will render to every man according to his deeds . in the end , the point is moot . i dont really care if the bible does say that man is justified by faith alone ( and it doesnt conclusively ) , my point is that i am unwilling to worship a creature that justifies only by faith anyway .	0
heck , no . you have convinced me . i say let them have sex ! let them have sex with whomever they want . your imaginary friends who want to have sex with their relatives can and should go do it . i support the right of imaginary people to have sex with whomever they want and to marry whomever they want ! power to the imaginary people ! give them liberty or give them imaginary death ! i think you need to breathe in a bag for a while . <repeated> then maybe have a nap .	1

he presented no arguement as to why he thought that this was not mere reflex action . as someone with only a minimum of medical knowledge , i personally cannot tell the difference between reflex action and a true sense of pain . that is true for most of us and seems to be true for this physician . i am left with having to trust scientists to distinguish between the two and scientists seem to agree that one needs a sufficiently developed cerebral cortex in order to register pain - which does not happen until the start of the third trimester . well , it seems to me that if you have a reflex it means you have an at least partially developed and functional nervous system which would tell me that you can feel pain .	0

i meant a decision that the majority of the population has made in regards to legislation . i know what you meant . my comment was to demonstrate the counter side of the issue . interracial marriage laws were overturned at a time when this country disapproved of interracial marriage by a margin of three to one . by your approach , interracial marriage laws <allcaps> should not </allcaps> have been overturned in the 1960 ' s . in fact , by your approach we still would have had illegal interracial marriage into the late 80 ' s , early 90 ' s . the 1 4 th amendment makes no proviso about allowing unjust discrimination in cases of majority rule . by your approach , <allcaps> what would be the point </allcaps> ? if the majority disapproves of the discrimination , they simply " vote " it out of existence . no need for the courts at all .	0
: it probably would have been better if scalia had said to himself when the case was brought before the court , " there certainly is no consensus about the meaning of the second amendment and i , as an amateur historian , am certainly not going to force my own personal views on others . i will let the people decide through their elected representatives how much gun control is necessary in their own communities .

" letting people decide " has already been done , once when the constitution was ratified with the <allcaps> bor </allcaps> and again when the xivth amendment was passed . he may as well say race issues will be decided by elected representatives the racial balance necessary in their own communities " he is completely dishonest and knows full well that this is a republic based on the law of the land , the constitution and not a democracy as he suggests . one may as well follow the piper over the cliff like a herd of lemmings to not recognize this time worn tune played by the gun grabbers . even new justice sotomayor , who claimed she ruled by precedent will be bound by the heller decision if she remains true to her purported philosophy . the debate between sui juris and res judicia should no longer be an issue with the liberals on this <allcaps> right </allcaps> ! it either applies to all or it applies to none which would result as justice w.o. douglas wrote : " a revolution " . it is in the government ' s ( federal especially ) best interests to keep our soldiers employed in foreign countries . <allcaps> btw </allcaps> , i think the court decision in nunn vs . state of georgia did the best summation of this right !	0
i would have to say that whoever told you about ' macro - evoution ' from a science perspective obviously did not explain things properly . it sounds like your ' science advice ' was either misunderstood or the advice was ' stacked ' . actually what sank that debate was a bunch of paleontologists from k state who started arguing for punctuated equilibrium . that was pretty much the end . i remember one board member was quoted as saying " these are public schools . we are luck if we can teach the kids to read "	1

i , personally , believe in the theory that since many things in nature make no sense without god , he created the universe . pandion has already pointed out that this is not a theory , it ' s a mode of wishful thinking . more damagingly , however , if you examine it for more than a moment it does not even fulfill the role you give it . you say ' many things in nature make no sense without god ' , but how do god ' s origins and nature make sense ? where did he / she / it spring from ? all you do by invoking god as an ' explanation ' is push the problems one step further back . the god hypothesis may look like an explanation , but it is not .	0

seven million people have applied for criminal background checks since november in an effort to buy guns , according to the <allcaps> fbi </allcaps> . that figure does not include virginia , whose gun shows do not require any background checks . and many news stories have referred to the new york shooter as being armed with a " high powered rifle " despite the fact that this was blatantly false . why should we take this story as being fully factual about the details of background checks and gun shows ? and a lot of newspapers are repeating the claims that fully - automatic machine guns , anti - tank missiles , fragmentation grenades and rocket launchers , are being bought by mexican drug cartel members - even though they could not possibly pass a background check - and that they are being bought from gun stores in america ! but no matter how many times we demand proof of such , <allcaps> none is ever presented </allcaps> ! come back with undeniable proof that <allcaps> ffl </allcaps> dealers never conduct federally mandated background checks when selling guns at gun shows , otherwise do not post on the topic anymore since you have nothing but lies and scare mongering tactics .	0

such an obvious ad hominem argument and obvious diversionary tactic . being unable to address the substance of my post , you try to dismiss me as a socialist . would you care to explain how my quoting of general washington , the first president of the us , led you to believe that i am a socialist ?

hm . to me that sounds frighteningly similar to something that could be heard several decades ago : ' our schools should only teach white children . we do not hate gays or anything , we just oppose having them in schools with our children , it just is not possible to us to allow them in our school . we are not really opposed to them going to school , we will support that as long as they go to their own school for blacks and are not allowed in our white schools . allowing them in the white schools is just silly . ' i am sorry , but just like what was decided back then , seperate but equal is never equal . basically they are saying that gays are somehow inferior and have to be put in their own instisution lest they sully the institution of marriage ( something heteros are doing without anyone else ' s help ) . separate but equal is never equal ? which are better ? boys ' or girls ' bathrooms ? other than that last statement i agree 100% . i do not believe gay civil unions are separate but equal but i do believe they could be if we wanted them to be . unfortunately the people who seem to only be against redefining marriage and for civil unions never want to give gays all the rights of marriage in a civil union .	0

more likely the criminal will shoot first rather than give the other chap a chance . there is no real reason for the average citizen to need or have a hand - gun the majority of criminals do not want to deal with trouble . most are not looking for a shootout where there ' s a risk of them getting shot at and most do not even want to shoot period . most are just looking for the free stuff they can get or in cases of rape they are definately not looking to fight an armed victim . it has been shown that criminals are less likely to break into a house whose owner has a gun .	0
this is why religion may not survive the future . people like arch are setting it as opposed to science and in that position it will be doomed to fail . the only hope is if the nuts stop making it in to an adversarial situation . arch is doing nothing but distorting the very thing he holds so dear , but that is already clear to anyone who knows his work here . here is what fascinates me about the judgmental criticism you offer of my opinion . in typical fashion you make claims which you do not support at all . here is my post below , point out <allcaps> with evidence </allcaps> ! <repeated> what i am distorting in any way ; especially that which i hold dear . in other words , write a cogent and rational post which makes sense when applied to the quoted post it intends to attack . emoticonxdonno	0
it does prove mathematically . i provided the necessary formula . on the second point , technology does cause the price of the means of production and labor to decrease . you are completely right on this . but the thing is , can technology keep up with demand ? this is harder than it sounds because we are continually having crises . i found this video which explains things much more in - depth . economic understanding does not come from a series of graphs and equations that come from a man who has no understanding of how humans work . the economy is not some mechanical machine , it is an organic mass of all 7 billion people of the world making millions decisions every day . behind all the smoke and mirrors , all this man said was this , in other words , concluded bullshit is still bullshit . and your second point , companies also compete on a technological level , if they are not as advanced as their competitors they generally go out of business because people want the better quality / cheaper product . what is the states incentive ? getting re - elected ? oh wait , thats easy to do when 95% of voters have no clue as to what is going on and only think about politics for 5 minutes during the elections .	0

why ? because being the victim of a violent crime happens enough times for it to be a genuine concern . i ' d like to see your statistics to show that violent crime rarely occurs , because the statistics i have seen show that it happens quite regularly . i did not say that violent crime " rarely " occurs , merely that the risk of being a victim of such is lower relative to other risks . i am genuinely curious if you care as much about protecting your heart as you care about protecting yourself from criminals .	0
so , you consider a so called theory which allows a 10 billion year gap out of an alleged potential 10 to 20 billion year age for the occurrence to be the most credible theory ? and is actually supported by the evidence ? if they have any evidence , why the 10 billion year gap for wiggle room ? no wonder you accept evolution as a rational possibility . honest question arch : where is the problem with a potential variance of 10 billion years ? i know this question may appear ridiculous to you but could you take the question in the spirit it was meant ?	0

it ' s really not that complicated , after all you did admit that you do not know . so i should not accept what you say without some degree of doubt . in which case i would ask for proof since my experience has shown you to be inconsistent in your responses inconsistent how ? if you give me specific quotes of mine that were inconsistent , i will be more able to respond . i never said i did not know . i said there is no empirical evidence . that is not synonymous with not knowing . the word " proof " as i am using it is subjective . what if proof enough for me is not for you . what is proof for me is not empirical . according to my definition , i have proof . it ' s just not proof that you will accept . it comes down to a simple difference of epistemology . i believe that personal metaphysical evidences can be accepted , you do not . end of story .	0

no . it would show that the government actually opposed the hostage takers . over the last generation or so , the dutch became quite good at rescuing hostages from the hijacked trains that became an annual event ; the russians lost a number of hostages in a theater a few years ago when the gas they used proved a bit strong ; and the filipinos became notorious for losing all hostages . but in every case where hostages were lost , the government was criticized for lack of competence rather than complicity . in iran , the mullahs were tacitly complicit in the crime . surrender to terrorism , such as you propose , does not work in the real world - it only encourages the terrorists . the iranian govenment was visibly anti - american . did the filipino and dutch cases have that component ? i am still quite convinced that americans would hate iran just as much as they accidentally caused american casualities .	0

religion = faith in a deity or deities ( rough definition ) atheism = lack of religion / deities therefore , atheism = lack of faith there is no " faithful " beginning point of atheism . so atheism does not " need " facts ? if it claims to have complete knowledge of evolution , does not it need all the facts ? if the answer is no , then how can it argue against religion ? miller did not explain it .	0
characters like our jyosh just want to diminish gays in society , and deny that gays are victims of religious homophobia . this is why he pretends that bullying of gay kids is just a feature of bullying in general ( as if blue - eyed kids were routinely bullied because of their eye colour ! ) , rather than a direct consequence of religious bigotry . he can not bring himself to admit the truth there . as we have seen in recent years , kids who are bullied can become so anti - social that they become violent , and attack those who have bullied them with weapons and mass murders . i am not condoning this behavior , but i am not surprised that it happens . those who support the bullying of gay kids and others . <repeated> well , you get what you sow .	0
anyone who suggests abortion is a dispute between the rights of a woman and a fetus is trying to mislead you or is negligent about the nature of abortion rights . this is not a dispute between woman vrs fetus but instead an issue between a woman ' s right to abortion and the interests of a small yet powerful vocal minority who believe they can project their views upon the majority . rights are not simply just passed out but are based upon interest … something the supreme court based their conclusion during roe v wade . in the many years that have supported abortion rights i have never found a single pro - lifer who could prove , outside their opinion and others , how a fetus has an interest in being born . unfortunately for them , fetuses have never elected pro - lifers to speak their behalf of but instead vice - versa . the pro - life movement plays as a self - appointed representative towards fetuses despite a lack of evidence or substance as to why a fetus , at the moment of conception , has an interest in living . so the debate is just whittled down to two factions ; those who believe that abortion is a right provide to women or that a minority can oppress their views upon others because it happens to offend their beliefs . women have a right to abortion because , as a nation , we have an invested interest in keeping abortion legal for them . for nearly 70 years we know that the fruits of coercion childbirth do not payoff … they lead to the corruption of law enforcement , provide criminals another avenue of wealth , wreck death and mutilation upon desperate women , destroy the healthcare system and leave behind an underground abortion rate that is rarely addressed by those who support coercion childbirth in the first place . fetuses are immune from having an self - interest in being born because they have never developed such feelings in the sheer majority of abortion ever performed . their brains are often far too primitive to hold such emotions or even awareness . if the fetus is incapable of feeling outraged or offended by being aborted then what is the big deal ? considering abortion was more legal during the times of our founding fathers then today . tell me then , does someone who is mentally retarded have a self - interest in staying alive ? what about someone in a coma ?	1
right . and that is the reason for peer review . creationists do not subject their ramblings to peer review . that is why so much care is devoted to the proper construction of experiments to test the hypotheses by real scientists . creationists just invent ad hoc stories without any experimentation . oh , dear . i seem to have lost you again .

consider an extreme literalist , asked to put the two genesis accounts side by side and then asked , " according to the two accounts , on what day was man created ? " everyone not a literalist can see that the two accounts conflict when read literally . but i have known literalists say , " i see no contradiction " - and they meant it . because their axiom is that the bible is infallible , so any problems with reading it are the reader ' s fault , whereas yours is that contradiction implies error . what ken ' s saying is that we can not draw a distinction between your axioms and those of a bible literalist in terms of which is ' right ' , because axioms are stated not proved : axioms define what is ' right ' . to reiterate : his error is in forgetting that the universe operates according to its own axioms , whatever they may be , and we can judge whether or not our axioms are congruent .	0
in affirming the absolute sanctity of life , we deny the sanctity of particular lives by putting them at the disposal of others - in the case of abortion , affirming the absolute sanctity of the baby ' s life involuntarily subordinates the mother to the child . this is not true . rather , when there is conflict between one ' s sanctity of life vs another ' s quality of life , the sanctity of life must win .	0

your position , it seems to me , turns on issues of quality of life and social justice such that children are entitled to either a minimum quality of life or none at all , and that preserving a woman ' s right to control over her body is necessary for her quality of life as an equal citizen . i do not argue so much the quality of llife of an individual woman but more for the quality of life , indeed of having access to life itself , of the children of the woman involved , because in many situations the concern and nurturance of a mother may be the only thing keeping children alive , especially in poor , war - torn nations that do not enjoy the relative wealth of the united states .	0

a very good argument for getting the government out of ' marriage ' . let the various religions deal with / define ' marriage ' as the wish to believe . the government should only deal with ' civil unions ' , regardless of the gender of the individuals involved . shall we regress to babble ? the government is already heavily into the term ' marriage ' . not only the us government , but governments all over the world refer to ' marriage ' as the legal union of a man and a woman . changing the definition in one country would likely create confusion everywhere . what if some countries required you to clarify whether you were married to a man or a woman in order to get a visa ? do we need to define several types or classes of ' married couple ' . what if some countries objecting to the concealment of the gender of one ' s spouse instituted a death penalty for it ? i would argue that legally joined same - sex couples should have all the benefits and rights afforded married couples , but not for redefining ' marriage ' solely for the purpose of calling them such .	1

anti - abortion legislation is simply a tool by which they try to maintain a less sexually permissive society , believing that if women who fall pregnant outside of marriage are forced to endure pregnancy and likely child - raising alone , rather than being offered an easy way out , they will be less likely to have sex outside of marriage . i think you fail to take into account that for most opposers of abortion , they genuinely feel they are trying to save lives by their opposition . in many cases it ' s not a matter of trying control sexual prermissiveness in society but preventing lives from being killed . disagree or not , you can not separate the anti - abortion message from the fact that it holds to the view that abortion is a form of murder .	0

i agree . <repeated> it ' s just too bad sometimes with young adults they do not think about what might happen , they just respond with natural urges . and this results sometimes is someone becoming " with child " even though it was not what they set out to do ! so should we force them to have the child and put it up for adoption ? if so consider there are lots of children waiting to be taken in and most of them are not infants . i do not think we have any business forcing anyone to do something they do not want to do . the father is supplying his <allcaps> dna </allcaps> when he engages in sexual relations . after than point he has in effect signed a blank check . it ' s like the old saw , if you do not want to do the time , do not do the crime . fathers to be should not be engaging in sex unless they intend to pony up with the montly check . i come from a bit of a bias on this subject because this was my area of endeavor for some 20 + years .	0

abortion , voting , spousal abuse , property ownership , social status , equal pay and the list goes on . in the us as recently as 50 - years ago , the list was endless if the woman was black living in certain us states . we were making some social progress , but that seems to be slowing in several states as our government imposed siege mentality rolls out the same old insecurities . as posted by tastyfish in kinder terms , fundamentalists consider the past century of advancement of womens rights as a bad thing ; barefoot , pregnant , uneducated and chained in the hut being their ideal woman . i am sorry , but i find this completely ridiculous and unfounded . i can see ( remotely ) how abortion might be considered anti - woman ( although it is of course anti - life before being anything else ) , but how has christianity directly sanctioned the questions of women ' s suffrage , spousal abuse , property ownership , social status , etc ? . <repeated> by the way , do you consider fundamentalists to be the best representatives of a religion ? i am catholic , and i believe i understand the dogmas and principles of my faith quite enougth to say that nothing of what you have mentioned ( except abortion , because it has nothing to do with women ' s rights ) are viewed positively by the catholic church , or ever have been . please explain with details .	0

i am aware of that . i am just having trouble reconciling the idea of removing a fundamental right based on a misdemeanor conviction and was wondering if there is similar precedent elsewhere . could it be that the supreme court does not view the right protected by the second amendment as being fundamental ? this is the same court that said that only guns in common use are protected by the second amendment . that tells me the supreme court does not think the right to bear arms is as fundamental as other rights protected by the bill of rights . the protection of a newspaper by freedom of the press does not depend on the newspaper being in common use .	0

if abortion is made illegal i predict that you will see across the border abortion clinics , in canada and states that still premit abortion . are we to fill the prisons with those seeking abortions in places where it is legal if they live in states that do not allow abortions ? prolifers better becare for what they wish for . prolifers tend to be conservative and do not like taxes . they better get ready to pay , in taxes , for the extra prisons and social programs needed for all those abandoned children . your claim is not supported in the least . if we look to the landmark abortion case roe v . wade , we find that it was not women seeking abortions that were punished , but the people who procured the abortion that were . it would be the same if abortion were again made illegal . to prove this , we need only to look at a recent abortion regulatory statute : the partial birth abortion ban act . needless to say , there are far less doctors who perform abortions than there are women who seek them , and because it was not a problem executing abortion law prior to 1973 , it likewise will not be a problem executing abortion law should abortion be made illegal again .	0
you are wasting your time phyllis , these spiritually dead empty suits are just too shallow to appreciate the value of a life they can not communicate with verbally . how pathetic they are not to appreciate that with all of the value and potential they see in themselves , that at one time they were exactly like these unborn children with the same mental existence they now claim is justification for their extermination . there is the potential for a human that comes out of many , crude and vulgar things . some end up on a maxi pad or when a guy reaches for the box of kleenex . should i feel a special bond with the conceptions rudely flushed out because they could not make it to the uterine wall ? they had the potential , the <allcaps> dna </allcaps> , were once a life too , and made a valiant effort . life is constantly in motion . we do not value all life , or maybe not all life the same . when it appears to have some aspects of human personhood , this would seem like a logical marker , where we ' d place greater value .	1

the fossil record does not support this . so , in an attempt to deal with this problem , gould and eldredge came up with a theory called , punctuated equilibrium . actually , the fossil record does support it . both eldredge and gould have discussed it . both men made observations of slow gradual speciation in the fossil record in a small geographical area . these changes were reflected at other locations as an abrupt change from one species to another . but given that such changes take place very quickly in populations that are usually under environmental stress and isolated from the main population , and given the rarity of fossilization in the first place , we do not expect to find many examples in the fossil record . it is a bit like trying to time a 100 yd . dash with a sundial . the fossil record just is not fine grained enough to see the rapid ( 50 - 60 thousand years ) changes .	0

peter was obviously there are more writings of peter apart from the gospel of mark and 1 & 2 peter you find in the bible . <repeated> you will discover it is not only the bible that the church use for their deposit of faith but a number of other writings regarded as sacred tradition . it was peter and the apostles who had influence over paul not vice versa . if peter and the apostles influenced paul and peter had primacy among the apostles obviously it was peter who influenced the church not paul , since paul was influenced by peter ! if a frog had wings he would not bump his butt when he jumped . based on results paul had more influence . how can you simply ignore the obvious ? christianity has hurt itself over and over again because of it ' s unwillingness to concede that sometimes it ' s wrong . how long did it take the church to acknowledge the earth moves around the sun or that the earth wasn ' t flat . instead they either ignore the issue , bury it through violence or intimidation , or come up with some ridiculous idea that is based on nothing to justify why they are right .	0

so yes the existance of other religions can be seen as disproof for your god , becuas logic dictates that you must ask yourself why your god didint speak to people in asia or south america . there are several scientific explanations for the nature of the earth . some use ' science ' to say that the world is flat . granted that these beliefs are not widely accepted , but then not all religions are widely accepted . by your reasoning or ' logic ' you must ask yourself about whether you should rely on science when there are many different scientific theories . the flat earth news , at least back then , had a regular column , " one hundred proofs earth is not a globe .

i think there is something wrong with premse one . it translates into english as " if god exists , then he exists in all possible worlds . " no logical rule justifies this statement . it is equally foolish to say that " if england exists , then it exists in all possible worlds . " but clearly , england does not exist in the possible world where earth never formed . the reason why premise 1 can logically stand is that god is first of all defined as the " greatest possible being " . no matter what reality we are considering , such a thing as the greatest possible being in that relity must exist . " greatest " is a superlative , compared to all other beings that existits like " the oldest man alive " . no matter what scenario , such a person as the oldest man alive will always exist , therefore such a man ( that fits that definition ) will have a necessary existence	0
belief that memory and free will exist but do not take up space does not require belief in a personal god . well memory is <allcaps> not </allcaps> something that is immaterial is it . its always implemented in the form of material processes well known to biochemistry . metabolism , ion flows , neuron activity and interconnections , along with potentiation of those connections into networks . free - will of course is what we call the experience of our choices being not wholly determined by external states alone . by no means does that exclude the fact that our internal states ( of which we are largely ignorant ) also play a role . the autonomy arises from the operation of the brain and those internal states . again a purely materialist explanation . and there is no evidence of anything other than material processes in the experience of free - will . in other words neither memory nor free - will require a non - materialist viewpoint .	0

no doubt that people who are determined to be anti - bush will always try and find something wrong with it , but i think bush ' s speech last night was very good . he was confident , poised , the speech had substance and specifics , and he showed once again that he ' s a better orator than he ' s given credit for . even a number of democrats complemeted it . only the hardest people would not be touched by the iraqi woman who ' s husband was killed by saddam ' s intel , embracing the mother of a fallen soldier . a lot of people got teary at that unstaged moment , including the president himself . kind of put the whole thing in perspective . is that why when everyone turned their back to bush to cheer the couple , bush just sat there with his hands folded looking impatient ? what was really sickening to me was when everyone put ink on their fingers . they totally cheapened the bravery of the iraqis . none of these pissants waited in line where they might be shot . they did not walk home hoping no one would see the ink and kill them . and they certainly are not in the middle of the war . it was truly sick for them to have that ink on their fingers .	0

to ss , results from new mutations are by definition different from the normal , so your objection makes no sense . no one is disputing that there are serious negative side effects with the sickle cell trait . however , in terms of the reproductive success of families with sickle cell vs those without , the ones with the trait do better overall than the ones without , in areas severely beset with malaria and in times before medicine , despite the negative effects . the positives outweigh the negatives , so the sickle cell trait is therefore beneficial in terms of natural selection . i am referring to chemist ' s assertion that mutations cause a beneficial modification to the morphology of hemoglobin . my two links say the hemoglobin becomes ' abnormal , ' thus his example fails . and you are assuming that this mutation is random . why ? cancer mutations are not random . <repeated> they are lead up to by epigenetic changes . why not this ? <url>	0

false . this is not a valid definition of atheism . atheism is the lack of theism ( the belief in gods ) . certainly , if i said " there is not a tiger in my bathroom " , i would not need to have a camera in there to see . it ' s called being reasonable . how do you know there is not a tiger in the bathroom ? you feel very strongly and have over - whelming evidence that there is no tiger in your bathroom ? ( you live in an urban area , there are no zoos , you do not hear scratching or biting or the maiming of your poodle , and the water is going ) but you cannot prove a negative . which is also why you will not be able to prove that creationism is wrong , and why we can not prove evolution is wrong . the focus must be on proving one right . how you might do that depends on your method of reasoning and thought .	0

it appears to me , that if slavery had been put up to a vote in texas back before the civil war , and texans voted to add an amendment to their state constitution legalizing slavery of blacks ( which they would have ) , you could as simply say " maybe , just maybe , the reason that many american people think slavery of blacks is right is simply because it is .

blah , blah , blah . so you find playing word games more edifying than speaking out against homophobia . or homophobic actions , as you seem to prefer . you may find that some people find that preference a reason to question your commitment to gay rights .

actually its not sickening in any way . these kids are at risk and need to know the resources available to them to avoid realizing those risks . frankly i thinik its a good idea to trot them around to agencies and organizations which they may need to interact with in the future . knowledge can keep them out of deep trouble . ignorance will not do so . so you think it is a good idea for public schools to assume the role of parents ? perhaps you would support a balance then . given what you say here , you would not think it a bad idea for the new hampshire school system to take a field trip to the local catholic church would you ? you know , so kids can know what resources , agencies , and organizations are available to them in the event that they may need to interact with them in the future . the school board apparently gets the message , however . according to the article , it has instructed school administrators to investigate the matter , and determine whether disciplinary action is necessary . i would think it is .	1

you may , but firstly , that argument may well not fly - much of the grain going to these animals is essentially the trash left over from other production to begin with , unfit for human consumption . nearly all the food humans eat today , even in the western world is gm including maize , tomatoes , and soy , etc , etc . used as ingredients in products such some soymilk . essentially everything is with the exception of " organic " . however , as i noted above , i would not make this argument because i think gm soy esecially is not very healthy for people snd gm foods tend to be more prone to bacterial infection which can make people sick . i have not read from all sides , however .	0

atheist answer : its relgious <allcaps> people </allcaps> that expect us to believe in god . god himself does not have any kind of expectations . theist answer : the bible says that without faith its impossible to please god , and since the bible also says that the bible is god ' s true word , then we only need faith to believe the bible and by extension to believe in god . actually , everything the bible say ' s belies your " atheist answer " . the reality is that the world itself and all of gods creation speaks to his existence as being self evident . it takes a degree of faith to accept jesus as our personal savior , but as far as accepting the reality of god himself , all one need do is look observe the world we live in to see that only an incredible and loving god could create such a beautiful and marvelous world with so many amazing symbiotic and perfectly interdependent forms of life .	0
and what of when you go by some moral standard to determine what is right and wrong in other peoples ' lives as well ? what ? you do not do that ? bull . you can not tell me you never have an opinion or judgment on anything anyone else does . but by your logic , that would be imposing on them . sorry , that dog just does not hunt . everyone has some basis for the views they have about they way they think society would be best . there ' s no law that says people can not participate in that process with religion or anything else as their moral basis . ' imposing religion ' is not the same as using religion as a basis , and it ' s the fact that you are wrong on this that ' s why religious people are continually able to have religion as their basis of social change , just as equally as anything else . of course everyone has some basis for their views . not even denying that . however there are ways that using that " basis " most certainly is an imposition and the gay rights battle is a prime example . there are many , many , many people who have done work to stop / block gay marriage and other gay rights when they , themselves , are not gay . that is not merely passing judgement - that is imposition . all i am asking here is that archie , you , jp , etc . own that .	0
my biggest problem with the gay rights issue is their tireless and often deceptive efforts to drag science into the whole thing . we know that there is nothing that ties biology and genes into sexual orientation , yet the gay society insists that there is , supporting shabby studies with inconclusive results and publishing them as facts . i have absolutely no problem with the gay lifestyle , marriage rights or social place . but when it must be done under the guise of false science , there is a problem from what ive seen , homosexuality , and sexuality on a whole , is indeed a complex issue . it is misunderstood , and many ' authorities ' on the subject submit conflicting reports , making the issue even more complicated . not only that , but people guard their sexuality with strong emotions , and therefore tend to believe what they want to believe about it . it makes finding the truth 10 times more difficult . we do ? how do we know that ? i will agree that there is not yet proof to make such a link , but i am unaware of proof that there is no link . did i miss something ?	0

so says the offspring of islam . <repeated> still wrong but vehement in his certitude . sheer bluster and effrontery does nothing to counter jo ' s calm and factual comments . which is pretty much normal for arch . do you think he realizes that many muslims in europe are cultural muslims ? that many who emigrate to europe are quite disgusted with what they see back in their homelands ? the rise of gay muslims in europe is quite interesting as to how they have fully adopted the views of their adopted european homeland and are afraid of returning to their original home countries . the notion that arch has that once a muslim always a crazy muslim is pretty nuts , but nothing but typical from a guy who thought that tv props are good evidence for 6,000 year old acts of creation .	0

so every republican president for the last 30 years has been a rino . <repeated> and every republican congressman ? the fact is that government has expanded faster under republican administrations than democratic ones for almost 50 years now , easy . this shows that , like so many other things , you are completely ignorant of ron pauls position on iran . he does not advocating ' appeasing ' iran . see , like out founding fathers , paul believes that if they dont threaten our national security , it has nothing to do with us and we should leave them alone . that costs us nothing . running around the world fighting pre - emptive wars that bankrupt us against opponents who posed no danger to us is not a viable long term strategy . considering the dumbocrats have held the house ( which initiates spending bills ) for most of that time , then you have nothing but more hot air . oh yes he does . he will let them get the bomb , knowing they want to wipe out israel . not very bright of him . is he an anti - semite ?	0
however , ideas for laws come from a morality . in fact , our constitution did . to sit around and watch people die . that is something i ' d rather not do and i am forced to . that is a specious argument . the constitution is not an embodiment of what is good and evil for humans to do , but of what is of value in a free society . the constitution does not judge the goodness and badness of human character . ideas for laws come from morality ? the concept of morality came from a desire to survive as we evolved . so you see the law preventing someone from interfering with your life as the same as the law allowing someone to interfere with your life ?	0
whether the anglican church is apostolic or not is a matter of opinion . the roman church started as an imperial church . its claim to apostolic succession is dubious as well , given the nature of some of the pope ' s in the middle ages , who were clearly chosen by outside influences . the independence of the church of england may have started with henry , but anglicanism is more correctly dated from elizabeth . the priest was and is well aware that i am an anglican , though we are of the same faith , christianity . so was his predecessor who i also received communion from . deviation from catholic dogma is common in the catholic church . ms . bennet , in your opinion , is the anglican church apostolic ? if so , what is the case that it presents for apostolic succession ? the roman church did not start as an imperial church . the empire wasn ' t around for 300 years or so . i think many martyrs of the faith would differ with that assertion . it started at peter ' s appointment as the foundation of the church and was solidified in the upper room after jesus ' resurrection . why do you desire to receive communion at a catholic church ?	0
you are correct . i did not know that s africa had abolished the death penalty . no death penalty = no death penalty for firearms posession . s africa has the most restrictive gun laws on the planet . they also have the highets murder rate in the western wor so what are some examples of restrictive gun laws in south africa ? the people in south africa think their gun laws are not strict enough . in one of your previous posts you seem determined to use south africa as evidence that outlawing guns does not work .	0
absolutely . even worse are the rights of unmarried fathers , who seem to have no rights whatsoever just because they never married the mother of the child . i completely believe that fathers can be just as good parents as mothers , even better in some cases . but everything is mother centred when it comes to parenting , for example , why are baby changing areas always within the womens toilets ? what are men supposed to do if they take out their baby themselves ? off topic i know but it ' s infuriating ! no , i completely agree . it ' s frustrating from a woman ' s point of view also . does this mean that if a father and mother take their child out somewhere , it ' s solely the woman ' s responsibility to take care of the child ? things should definitely be levelled when it comes to parenting .	0
well to get healthcare from $6000 per person to $3,400 per person you ' d have to pay them less or fire them . so do i understand you correctly that we will either cut pay or fire doctors and nurses ? you are just playing dumb , right ? there will be fewer technicians and fewer orders for equipment <allcaps> per insured </allcaps> . their pay will not be cut . there will be fewer of them <allcaps> per insured </allcaps> . initially the absolute volume will increase .	1

if drugs were more accessable we would likly have far less crime and far more drug adicts . i think you might want to check your logic here . <repeated> as far as i am aware , drug addicts cause a great deal of crime to support their habit . as you are , i am not terribly fond of policing someone ' s personal habits , but when drugs are the motivating force behind burglaries , assaults and muggings and addicts carry diseases such <allcaps> aids </allcaps> and tuberculosis then means of curtailing this should be explored . this may include policing or controlling the supply of drugs to an area to cut down and the amount of drugs sold , and thus less crime to support fewer habits . easy access to drugs is , logically , part of the problem .	0
two gun deaths per 100,000 population per year instead of fourteen ? emoticonxrolleyes at what cost ? how many civil rights are you willing to give up in the name of a few less murders each year ? are you perfectly willing to be stopped by the police on a block - by - block basis and forced to show identification and traveling papers , all the while the officers on location are pointing their guns right at your head , ready to <allcaps> x <elongated> </allcaps> you away at the first sign of a twitch or if you display even a hint of hesitation to comply ? how desperately do you crave a police state ? how much do you favor a nationwide curfew where violators can be arrested by the police and held without legal counsel for an indefinite period of time ? do you favor the use of physical and mental torture to force convictions even from the innocent ?	0
space is really , really big , so big it bigger than you can think of big . in addition , the building blocks of life have been detected all over the place . that is water , carbon , and hydrogen , and amino acids . d . adams ? <happy> this is , of course , an entire debate unto itself . i fully concede that logic dictates that we accept the possibility of life elsewhere . but that it ' s probable ? we simply do not have the data to make that leap . we have got some good theories about how life started here , but we do not know exactly what happened . and even if we did , we do not know how common those conditions are ' out there ' . if the conditions for life to arise are so bizarre that they only occur once every 20 billion years , and for all we know they might be , than we may well be the only life in the universe . logically , we just can not say . we do not have enough info to apply logic to the problem .	0

your selective memory is at work again . as i recall , in waco military vehicles and equipment were used against the branch davidians . nevermind the presence of members of delta force which was denied , at first , by the government . then they were caught lying again about using flammable tear gas which , ironically enough , is banned by the geneva convention for use against enemy troops . in the end , the ' open and shut case ' the government thought they had , blew up in their faces because of their lies and abuses . i also recall , at some point around the time of the great depression that u.s. troops were called out to quell food riots in new york , i think it was . there were a couple of young officers present by the name of macarthur and patton , i believe . there are a few other instances i am sure . and would guns in the hands of citizens have stopped that ? or does publicity , which has only increased since those events , stop them ? your selective reading ability is at work .	1

here is a thread where we can go at each others throats , so - to - speak . which is the better ecnomic system : capitalism or socialism ? falling , did i say that ' the church alone provides for the needy ? ' if i did please point it out to me . each religion has its own place to turn , but none of them should ever be able to turn to the federal government . the constitution gives certain delegated powers to the federal government and handing money out for educational purposes is not one of them . socialism is merely the stepping stone into communism , and i do not want to see this nation start down that path . maybe i live by the constitution because it is ' the supreme law of the land . ' the question is not why do i live by the constitution , but why do not you ? until the constitution is replaced it will govern this land , and i plan to live by it .	0

of course it is known that wild animals that are sick just die from natural selection ( they get eaten , or they do not manage to find food ) and even livestock , if it has some disease , can be culled to prevent outbreak of disease . in humans it is different though , there are quarantine zones to prevent spread of certain disease . however , religion is sort of disease , but mind disease which can not be prevented to spread by some quarantine , but only by some great culling , and restricting it ' s spreading . religion is so embedded within ( weak ) human mind that it can not be removed normally ( e . g . non violently , as those emotional weaklings would call it ) but only by eradication . i really hope you are joking . extremism is a disease , but not religion . religion can be , and is , for the most part , peaceful .	0

i have had some experience with this topic . <repeated> my father was murdered when i was 12 , the perp was convicted a year later and was charged with 1 st degree murder and sentenced to death . <repeated> flash forward 24 years he ran his course of appeals and every legal proceeding you can imagine . his lawyer after 20 years of him being on death row came up with ' retardation ' mind you he ' walked ' 3 times . <repeated> all of which i was there to witness . i was to be a witness to the execution by request of my grandmother who has passed on . anyway at the last minute he got a stay of execution . back to the drawing table . <repeated> last year after several hearings , they came to the conclusion the he was mentally retarded . <repeated> scoring a 75 on his iq test . the limit for the death penalty is 70 . he was a high school graduate , had a family , held jobs . <repeated> and clearly competent , nonetheless they found him otherwise . so now he is off death row , and the da has told me that it is possible he could get parole eventually . with all that it has been a very trying time for me and i have had to struggle with how i really felt about the death penalty . i have been a supporter but never really could my put heart into my conviction . i do not know if it is out of revenge or not , hard to say i am too close to the matter . but i did feel let down when they took him off death row , now i feel like there will never be justice . i put so many years of waiting for that moment . <repeated> it sounds kind of sick , but as much as i dreaded witnessing it , i also looked forward to it . i do think that maybe life in prison may be better , only if his experience there is just awful . <repeated> but the revenge side of me , just wants him to suffer what my father suffered . but if you were to ask me to think about this the old fashion way , which would be i should be the one to flip the switch . <repeated> not so sure i could do it . so with all that i still do not really know if i in my heart , support the death penalty or i am just after revenge . the victims of violence i would imagine go through this struggle . side note . <repeated> the man who murdered my father also killed a young girl when he was a minor . <repeated> he had escaped from the correctional facility he was in . <repeated> and it was several years later when he killed my dad . so sorry , anastasia . <repeated> that ' s a horrible thing to face . and now , using that excuse ? what ! if justice was swift for the guilty then he would not have escaped only to do it again . some criminals never change , and via your testimony , only live to do it again . there are some who need to be put to death . your situation made me shudder , anastasia . but , i am glad you did not let it ( revenge ) effect you to the point of taking his life yourself . if it would have been my father , those many years ago , i cannot say that i would have waited , nor would have accepted that lame excuse of retardation . i could very well be in prison myself .	0

<buzz> wrong , it ' s the conduct of both parties that need to be reigned in . and that starts with good parenting . for example , when you have a healthy marriage , children will generally model themselves after their parents ( disclaimer note i said ' generally ' there are exceptions , however disclaimer ) . why do so many lifers just skip right past the pregnancy as if it has no impact ? i am not talking about parenting . i do not advocate forcing anyone to parent . ever . that is why i support safe haven laws , signing away of parental rights , etc . i am talking about pregnancy . only a woman can be pregnant and should have the ultimate say in whether or not she is . it is her body , not your ' s , not the state ' s , not the church ' s , and not the fetus ' . when it comes to pregnancy - you wish only to legislate the bodies / reproductive organs of women . i bet you would not advocate chemical castration for any male who is not yet ready to be a parent .	0

emoticonxrolleyes no . not always credible . and i take it as credible . the woman ' s bias is not automatic cause for dismissal . you are biased against gay equality , but that does not mean your testimony is meaningless . newspapers have much higher standards for evidence . and as for ' should not be listened to ' , considering you take the self - contradictory bible as fact , written by people who were furthering their own superstitions , you are hardly a person to be criticizing . <repeated> emoticonxrolleyes that speaks a lot about you and shows other posters they should not take what you say at face value . yes it does . if i go before congress and say ' being gay is a choice without a doubt made at age 11 ' and had no evidence than i should be laughed at . same thing as this woman . she makes a claim with no evidence and reason to lie . this makes you not credible . than a legislative body ? while probably true , this is sad because newspapers have none .	0

not forever . we just do not know when he will return . when christ comes down on earth ( the rapture ) , it is said that all the believers will rise into heaven and he will close the sky again . the remaining people on earth will have seven years of abundance , then seven years of absolute torture ; there will be no peace at all on earth . so . <repeated> whats he been doing for the past two thousand years ? i am sure this rapture probably requires a lot of paperwork . <repeated> i mean , if you are going to torture and murder millions of people i guess you better have all your t ' s crossed and i ' s dotted huh ?	1
it doen ' t matter what trimester it is in . the shear fact that you are arguing over something as irrelevant as the trimester of the pregnancy means that you already understand that a decision to have an abortion is an intent to take a life . by arguing if the baby is considered living , is just people ' s way of trying to justify what they already know is wrong , hoping that the excuse of " if the baby is not conscious of it , then it is not that wrong . " it does not matter if the baby knows it or not . even if it was conscious of it , it will not care in a second . the moral dilemma comes in that , you had the intent of killing and that is what makes abortion in any stage morally wrong ! <repeated> the better question is , should the government take action ? because this is a wierd situation where the life is still 100% dependent of the mom and therefore a part of her body . the argument of a soul is negligable because there is no proof of the exsistence to of souls . i have no answer for you , just a plea to please keep an open mind and have compassion for both sides of the argument . it is the only way we can create progress and not hate . we all agree that abortion is " killing " . killing something that has yet to become self aware is different <allcaps> imo </allcaps> . funny you request an open " mind " . my point is that it ain ' t a human being if it ain ' t got no mind . that ' s why they unplug you when you are brain dead .	1
i disagree . well maybe technically . let us look at it this way . criminals ' access to guns may even go slightly up , because there are <allcaps> some </allcaps> criminals who may not want to obtain a handgun illegally . but the access of innocent citizens will go up way more than that of criminals , thus less criminals will want to commit a robbery or something with the fear of the person living there owning a gun . criminals may forget getting a gun anyway so maybe indirectly , but the major problem is access to guns , not ownership of guns . access will go up , no one disputes that , but people using them for self - defense goes much higher so that more than makes up for the increase in access for criminals . make sense ? yes , but i think you missed my point . i stated this above , remember the prohabition ? people actually drank <allcaps> more </allcaps> alchohal . without a ban , law abiding citizens and criminals will have them , with a ban , there will be just criminals .	0
well let us look at the facts themselves . concealed carry laws are now part of the legal system in 48 out of the 50 states in this country . concealed carry started in florida and worked their way from one state to another over a continuous 20 year period , and not once has a concealed carry law ever been repealed , for any reason . gun control laws , like handgun rationing , mandatory reporting standards , ammunition registries , secondary background checks , trigger lock and storage requirements , etc . are limited in their reach , sticking to only certain states . there ' s been no mass adoption of these laws by various states across the country , and there ' s even been cases of them being repealed due to ineffectiveness . if gun control laws worked at controlling crime , and the presence of firearms actually had the potential to increase crime rates , these facts would be reversed . and the brady background check has not been repealed either so by your " logic " it must be effective .	1
if you do not like the country , feel free to leave . go over to britain or canada where they have whatever you could possibly want in terms of social policy . <repeated> except for the right to question the government and complain about the quality of living . do you actually believe that ? do you have any evidence ? complaining is practically the national passtime here .	1
actually , i know a lot of homeschoolers that went to my church . they are all very very socially incapable of doing much of all . i am sorry , but thats how it is . i know almost as a fact that they would be much better off if they were not protected by their parents and allowed to live in the real world . maybe you are in the minority . falling , the fact that the homeschoolers you mentioned do not choose to socialize with you , does not mean they are not far more capable of functioning in the " <allcaps> real world </allcaps> " than you might think . i would not choose to socialize with you in the " <allcaps> real world </allcaps> " , and you most likely would not choose to socialize with me , but that does not make me your social inferior !	0

intelligent design is a recent concept ( not associated with any one religion ) and it has not had over 100 years to be studied . why not start now ? it can not happen if we block it from future generations . why not give it a chance , study it , search for evidence , and offer it up for peer review ? what are you afraid of ? that it can mathematically rule out previous evolutionary theories ? it has a chance . any scientist has the opportunity to study id . we are discussing the science classroom . we already teach it as a hypothesis in most schools . but it simply should not be taught as a valid alternative to evolution . that ' s what this debate is over .	0
precisely , if a master craftsman destroys his finest creation because it is flawed , is he doing something wrong ? or is not it his right to do what he wishes with his creation . so it is with the maker of all that is . so they may seem like terrible acts from your <allcaps> very limited perspective </allcaps> , but from the perspective of a perfect and holy god , his judgement was a righteous one on all levels . but why would one expect you to get that ? so then how do you know that abortion is not in the plan then ? if as you say we have " <allcaps> very limited perspective </allcaps> "	1
getting back to the original question . <repeated> yes , i think it is very reasonable to be against abortion and for a war . i do not thin anybody is " for war " , but rather " for a war " . each one is different and needs to be evaluated separately . just like no one is really " for " abortions , but they think that it ' s the woman ' s right to decide . maybe that ' s like when congress gave the president the right to decide to go to war , even when they were supposed to declare war .	0

all the knowledge from science has come from trusting mutual experience . it has gotten us far and will continue to ( as long as we do not destroy ourselves in misusing that knowledge ) . but the belief that ' its gotten us far ' is itself a ' scientific ' type belief , in fact it has less proof on the empirical assumptions than the science itself . justifying the validity of experience by experience is the intellectual equivalent of saying ' god must exist , because god is good and would not allow a world without god ' .	0

lmao ! did you read my last sentence , the conclusion of my post ? and i quote : " so to answer your question : yes " damn im so evasive ! since you asked the question again , ill answer again <snip> stuff about us being in a democratic system </snip> as a christian , if a legal matter is being contested , and you want to oppose it , you are certainly welcome to do so . as a gay , if you want to propose a legal matter , a christian should be equally welcome to contest it . it is doing unto others as they would have others do unto them , so to answer your question : yes was that so hard ? anti gay christians do want gays to oppose their , marriages , discriminate against them , oppose christians from being able to adopt , and practice thier religion . since anti gay christians are doing all these things to gay people then that is how they want gay people to treat christians .	1

well you can thank god for that then , because what you were proposing for single payer was some of the most ridiculous stupidity i ' d ever seen . whenever anyone wanted to discuss it rationally you ' d just spam the boards with another petition ' 72% of single mothers support single payer ! 84% of single mothers reject raising taxes to pay for single payer ! therefore we should go single payer ! ' i even recall you once berated steve for arguing in his own words instead of linking to a poll to support him . why do you think those numbers are relevant ? popularity is not a magic power that turns bad policy into good . if i am spamming a petition , then you are spamming paul krugman , darling . and i have put up plenty of rational arguments with citations . you , on the other hand , have yet to propose one reason why single payer is ridiculous . because we elect representatives to do what we say , not what the lobbyists bribe them to do . you still have not said anything besides ' stupid ' , ' ridiculous ' , and ' maoist ' or ' socialist ' , which is usually what people say about the few politicians who are not on the take . emoticonxgood	0

<allcaps> mexico city </allcaps> – guards and officials at a prison in northern mexico allegedly let inmates out , lent them guns and allowed them to use official vehicles to carry out drug - related killings , including the massacre of 17 people last week , prosecutors said sunday . after carrying out the killings the inmates would return to their cells , the attorney general ' s office said in a revelation that was shocking even for a country wearied by years of drug violence and corruption . " according to witnesses , the inmates were allowed to leave with authorization of the prison director . <repeated> to carry out instructions for revenge attacks using official vehicles and using guards ' weapons for executions , " office spokesman ricardo najera said at a news conference . the director of the prison in gomez palacio in durango state and three other officials were placed under a form of house arrest pending further investigation . no charges have yet been filed . prosecutors said the prison - based hit squad is suspected in three mass shootings , including the july 18 attack on a party in the city of torreon , which is near gomez palacio . in that incident , gunmen fired indiscriminately into a crowd of mainly young people in a rented hall , killing 17 people , including women . police found more than 120 bullet casings at the scene , and najera said tests matched those casings to four assault rifles assigned to guards at the prison . similar ballistics tests linked the guns to earlier killings at two bars in torreon , the capital of northern coahuila state , he said . at least 16 people were killed in those attacks on feb . 1 and may 15 , local media reported . najera blamed the killings on disputes between rival drug cartels . " unfortunately , the criminals also carried out cowardly killings of innocent civilians , only to return to their cells , " he said . coahuila and neighboring durango are among several northern states that have seen a spike in drug - related violence that authorities attribute to a fight between the gulf cartel and its former enforcers , known as the zetas . mexico has long had a problem with investigating crimes , catching criminals and convicting people . reports estimate less than 2 percent of crimes in mexico result in prison sentences . but sunday ' s revelation suggests that even putting cartel gunmen in prison may not prevent them from continuing to commit crimes . interior secretary francisco blake said the revelation " can only be seen as a wake - up call for authorities to address , once again , the state of deterioration in many local law enforcement institutions . <repeated> we cannot allow this kind of thing to happen again . " also sunday , mexican federal police announced the arrest of an alleged leading member of a drug gang blamed in recent killings and a car - bombing in the violence - ridden border city of ciudad juarez , across from el paso , texas . police described luis vazquez barragan , 39 , as a top member of la linea gang , the enforcement arm of the juarez cartel , saying he received orders directly from cartel boss vicente carrillo fuentes . vazquez barragan allegedly organized payments , moved drugs and oversaw a system of safe houses in and around ciudad juarez . police said he held the same rank as fugitive gang leader juan pablo ledezma , though vazquez barragan is not named on reward or most - wanted lists published by the attorney general ' s office , as ledezma is . la linea has been blamed for a car bomb that killed three people july 15 in ciudad juarez and for two separate shootings march 13 that killed a u.s. consular employee and two other people connected to the consulate . police did not say when they caught vazquez barragan , but he was allegedly in possession of about a half - kilogram ( pound ) of cocaine and two guns . his arrest led to a raid on a safe house where authorities detained four suspects and freed a kidnap victim . also sunday , the attorney general ' s office said soldiers on patrol in ciudad madero in the border state of tamaulipas seized an arsenal of about three dozen guns , 17 grenades and thousands of bullets in a house . elsewhere in tamaulipas , police and prosecutors raided a lot full of truck - pulled tankers in the border city of reynosa and seized two loaded with oil of a type sometimes stolen from the pipelines of the state - owned petroleos mexicanos . nore than a dozen other tankers and freight containers were also seized . mexican drug cartels have allegedly become involved in increasingly sophisticated thefts of fuel and oil from mexico ' s pipelines . in the pacific coast state of guerrero , authorities reported sunday they had found the bullet - ridden bodies of six men dumped in various locations , including three in or around the resort of acapulco . two of the dead men were identified as people kidnapped earlier in the month . so somebody try and tell us , that with stuff like this going on , that america still needs to overhaul its gun laws to bring them more in line with those of mexico .	1

the militia of the second amendment is a militia that is described as being well regulated ( regulated by both the federal government and the states as spoken of in article 1 of the constitution ) . in our own day , i think the national guard would be the only militia that qualifies as being well regulated . alexander hamilton spoke of the desirability of the militia being well regulated : " it requires no skill in the science of war to discern that uniformity in the organization and discipline of the militia would be attended with the most beneficial effects , whenever they were called into service for the public defense . it would enable them to discharge the duties of the camp and of the field with mutual intelligence and concert an advantage of peculiar moment in the operations of an army ; and it would fit them much sooner to acquire the degree of proficiency in military functions which would be essential to their usefulness . this desirable uniformity can only be accomplished by confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority . it is , therefore , with the most evident propriety , that the plan of the convention proposes to empower the union " to provide for organizing , arming , and disciplining the militia , and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the united states , <allcaps> reserving to the states respectively the appointment of the officers </allcaps> , <allcaps> and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by congress </allcaps> . " the federalist papers - <allcaps> thomas </allcaps> ( library of congress ) we could go back to the days when most citizens were required to enroll in the militia , have guns and get military training - to what the founders really meant when they spoke of a well regulated militia being the security of a free state . but the supreme court along with pro - gun activists claiming to be pro - second amendment have decided to turn their back on that part of the second amendment while giving the lip service to the idea of a militia . well regulated as in the second amendment does not mean regulated by the government , it means well equiped and prepared . the framers of the constitution often spoke of a tyrannical government and how to keep one from coming to power , so why in the hell would they have said lets just give the government total control of guns . your definition of well regulated makes about as much sense as adding another day to the week .	0

funny that all proponents of abortion for unwanted pregnancies talk about abortion as if being a political statement : i control my body . funny that they never think that the reason most women need an abortion was because they could not control their legs and kept them crossed . they can not control their lust , so much for body control . emoticonxrolleyes which , we suppose , in your mind releases the sperm donor of any responsibility whatsoever , right ? is not it interesting that your solution for the abortion issue demands that women deny their sexuality while permitting men to run the gamut of theirs . does this attitude , of which you are not the only proponent , stem from a hatred or a fear of women ?	0

but that simply is not the case . science class is for science , and any school receiving government funding should use it to promote real science , which is thinking . until intelligent design can come up with evidence , as well as any potential advantage to the science community to id , it will be nothing but a religious belief . and religion does not belong in the science class any more than politics does . a completely different subject which has it ' s merit , but not as real science . it can not come up with evidence if it ' s suppressed from future generations . until you can show that happenstance origins are science , you have no basis to declare that intelligent design is not science . i agree that i have not shown how id has a potential advantage to the political corruptness of today ' s scientific community , but i have shown it ' s potential advantage to our society . i have shown how thinking is involved with it , the type of thinking involved in any school class involving philosophy , which you said science classes should have .	0

nfa , not nra - but your point remains . <repeated> ' to his credit / discredit ' is largely irrelevant to my point , however - i wasn ' t attempting to insult his personality . however , the fact that he represents the nfa strongly implies that he has a pro - gun bias ; something which should definitely be considered when reading an opinion piece , which the op is an example of . when someone says ' there is no convincing evidence for x', you have to look at what biases they may have about x which might cause them to set their requirements for ' convincing ' to be higher - or lower ! - than a less biased author would . well can you point to an instance , either in canada or the united kingdom , where the government mandated firearm registries have been instrumental in solving any number of vicious and felonious crimes ? i am not talking about catching people who let their registration lapse , or those who told their spouses about the location of their gun locker keys , i am talking about serious crimes like murder and robbery and others . can you provide us with any evidence that would point to how the registries have helped solve any such happenings ?	0

the ny times has a fairly good bio for judge roberts . <url> quote in particular struck me : in his confirmation testimony two years ago , he said that judges should be " ever mindful that they are insulated from democratic pressures precisely because the framers expected them to be discerning law , not shaping policy , " and added : " that means that judges should not look to their own personal views or preferences in deciding the cases before them . their commission is no license to impose their preferences from the bench . " if he holds to that belief than we could do alot worse . unfortunately his tenure on the bench has been so short that it ' s hard to say if he meant that , or was just saying what he thought people wanted to hear . yeah , but it ' s the nytimes . and it ' s an editorial . two things that , together , make a pungent recipe for a nice dish of bias .	1
we are talking about constitutional rights . in that case , even if you want to put religion into the mix . you really can not . but behind that are deeper , more fundamental issues about what homosexuality is and the morality of it . to many people who view homoseuxality as immoral , your movement seems to be trying to write immorality into law .	0
that ' s true , as long as ones pursuit of science is really science . in the case of " creation science , " there is no science involved . as trebor has said , " creation science " is an attempt to find scientific sounding reasons that can be used to justify the conclusions that have already been reached and that are not subject to change . that ' s how " creation science " works . begin with the conclusion and then search for scientific sounding justification . real science is a process and a way of learning . i think an open mind is the best thing to have when it comes to theories . i think there is some truth in everything .	0
i do not think so . i think everyone else is overcomplicating it . yeah , gays can not reproduce . survival to the fittest would indicate that gays should die off , but they are being helped along . if they were not helped along and were told to rely solely on themselves then they would have no chance of survival . well if that ' s the way humans work then the gay island would not do any better , unless of course you are saying gays are not human . but i am guessing what you mean is if the gays died off and the straight island had it ' s resources destroyed then the island itself would be worse off , but i was talking more about the people ' s civilization , not the island itself . sorry about lesbian island . it got hit by 2 earthquakes and a tsunami and sunk into the ocean . let us see if i understand you correctly , because i think you may be on to something incredibly insightful . let us see , the island with males and females , uh , can reproduce , and , . <repeated> uh , eureka , i have got it ! <repeated> you need a male and female to sexually reproduce ! <repeated> that ' s ingenious ! <repeated> you are brilliant , cool spot ! <repeated> you are forgetting one thing . the island without the gay guys would not be nearly as fabulous .	1

regardless of the name change , the calendars are still keyed on the birth and death of christ . <repeated> and that will be so at least until the atheists are able to come up with another numbering system and force it on everyone else just to pacify their own baby mentalities . i thought that the most commonly accepted date for the alleged birth of jesus was in 4 b.c. assuming the current calendar really were keyed on the birth of christ , how could christ have been born before christ ?	1

that ' s an interesting insight . ( i am going to have to borrow that story . <repeated> <tong> i can not help but wonder for some people if the reason they " mature " on the issue of heterosexual sex has to do more with the fact that they start wanting to do it themselves . a desire to partake in the action , as opposed to actual mature development , causes them to shift their attitudes towards heterosexuality . to me , that ' s one of the reasons christianity ( in general ) has such a " tolerance " for divorce , which jesus spoke out against explicitly , while not as much tolerance for homosexuality . they want to do the divorce thing or sympathize with the desire for it , so suddenly it ' s more " tolerated " . <repeated> emoticonxrolleyes exactly , they are big on condeming the sins of those other guys . it makes them feel better about themselves . also , it is always a good idea to have a vitriolic campaign about something that will never change so they will always have an enemy - homos are not going to disappear , abortion will never be made illegal . that ' s how the religious right recruits folks - get ' em all indignant about the " others " and they never notice they are being fleeced by the fat little pastor .	1

i am still having a hard time with this . if nothing exists , no matter , then how can " the number one " exist ? on what basis is it defined ? if there is only nothing , then you can not add to it , like i said 0 + 0=0 . i know this is getting slightly off topic and philosophical , but it would seem to me that " concepts " , and i am not sure exactly how that ' s being defined , must have a basis in reality , and therefore in matter . i agree in that they are not created . i disagree in that <allcaps> imho </allcaps> , they are a function of our physical universe . <allcaps> imho </allcaps> , you do not have the concept without the universe to " define " it . i do not know , it ' s too early in the am , maybe someone can point out the errors in my thinking . waxy addition works in the intangible as well . 1 minute + 1 minute = 2 minutes . 1 idea + 1 idea = 2 ideas . the concept of quantity is not limited to matter . if there was just a vaccous void were absolutely nothing was happening , then there would be no application of logic . but even that in itself would be logical . nothing + nothing = nothing is logical . it would actually be logical if a void with nothing added to it result in something . so even in a void , logic still prevails	0

oh , really , pregnancy is not expensive ? have you gone through a pregnancy ? i talked with numerous friends who went through pregnancies , and the costs were astonishing - from the doctor visits , to the actual delivery which can cost well into the thousands ( tens of thousands if there are difficulties with the birth ) . just the visit i made shortly before getting an abortion was expensive . as for adoption , there very well may be no cost in the actual procedure - but there certainly are numerous costs - both monetarily and physically - before it . if you think otherwise , you are sadly mistaken . actually , one . after the adoptions years ago , we hit the financial slump and had a suprise . <repeated> the costs will extremely low . i have also been in discussion with numerous friends who have delivered , same story . somehow , no matter how there is no money and no help , babies get born . and as i have said , there are plenty of organizations that will cover all costs finacially in cases of adoption .	0
you have obviously been told this by a pro - choicer who will leap to any rationale no matter how shallow in order to justify his / her defense for abortion . he fails to appreciate that preventing an egg from being fertilized is not at all similar to murdering a fetus which is in many cases at a minimum of up to 3 months of development . hi ryuuichi , if i might defend your doctor for a second , i think i can explain his thinking . he / she understands that what you think you want at 17 yrs . old <allcaps> might </allcaps> be very different than what you will want when you are in your 2 0 s and in love with your potential soul mate . at that time , when the man of your dreams is real and you two actually discuss your future lives together , if you then decide to get your tubes tied and never have children , he will be confident that your decision is rational and based on a mutual decision with your spouse . see the difference ? to make that decision now could and probably would be greatly regretted since most men you meet in your 2 0 s who fall in love with you will desire to have children with you one day . very few men would choose to marry a woman who could never give them natural children . in fact , i can say with confidence that to make such a permanent decision without including the man you will fall in love with and want to marry one day is probably the most selfish decision a woman could make . think about it as a woman in love some day and you will see my point , i am sure . emoticonxangel and have a child with a terminal disease and watch them most likely die slowly because of my " soul mate .

some iowa county recorders say they have contemplated refusing to give a marriage license to gay couples who walk into the office , but so far none is vowing to do so . “ this is putting us in a very , very difficult position here , ” wayne county recorder angela horton said thursday in an interview . “ but sometimes you have to put aside your personal beliefs , your religious beliefs , when you are doing a job you have sworn under oath to provide . ” after hearing rumblings of discontent , a state official sent a strongly worded note to all recorders thursday explaining why they should obey the iowa supreme court ruling legalizing same - sex marriage when it takes effect april 27 . victoria hutton of the iowa department of public health informed recorders that the ruling has the force of law statewide : “ all county recorders in the state of iowa are required to comply with the varnum decision … and to issue marriage licenses to same sex couples in the same manner as licenses issued to opposite gender applicants . ” republican state senators on thursday crafted a new proposal that would give recorders an out if their religion is opposed to gay marriage , but senate democratic leader mike gronstal scorned it as “ blatantly unconstitutional . ” state to counties : obey gay marriage ruling , issue certificates | desmoinesregister . com | the des moines registerwhy is it that people of religion keep trying to seek special privilege for their religious beliefs ? do your job , or get out of the office . why is it any more special for a " christian " to have a " religious " belief against homosexuality , as opposed to a <allcaps> non </allcaps> - christian having a " non - religious " belief against homosexuality ? <repeated> but let me guess . <repeated> if they step down <allcaps> right </allcaps> after they find they will have to issue to gay couples , you ' d be in favor of them being able to be sued for it , simply because the " discrimination " in such an event was toward gays ? right ? at least if you are consistent with your stance elsewhere in regards to ' timing ' . <repeated> emoticonxrolleyesanyway , aside from that inconsistency with your position elsewhere , i agree that county officials should need to comply . after all , there are probably <allcaps> other </allcaps> examples whereby county officials have to do things that they are religiously against , such as issue divorce papers . or marry some drunk couple that they know are not really being serious even though they are tying the knot . <repeated> if all county officials could just refuse to do their job because of their objections - - for <allcaps> whatever </allcaps> reasons - - it would be a collosal mess .	0

i do not think there are many , who consider the fetus a person in the way you are implying , that are still for abortion " rights " . the debate is not if its ok to kill a human being because obviously your not going to get a huge debate on that but rather is the fetus a human being . whether a fetus is a person is not something open to consideration . an apple is not an orange . the reason that we have two words to apply as labels is simply because they absolutely are not the same thing . it is that simple . suppose that a fetus is frozen and implanted in a female 22 years later . is it of legal drinking age at birth ? obviously not . we currently have the technology to actually do this .	0

wrong again . the tooth was never formally described or published . while the discoverer may have thought it was a human tooth , it was a newspaper that reported the find as being some race of human . actually it was after further finds were made that it was realized that the tooth wasn ' t human . again , it was never claimed by science to be a race of man . no description and no publishing means that it was never presented foramlly to science . you creationaries are so cute . you have to keep pretending that this kind of thing is meaningful . it is meaningful only to reveal the integrity of creationaries and christianaries . i suppose piltdown man was the product of newspapers , cute indeed !	1
o <elongated> , you had your gut cut open ? <repeated> what a pity . i think you could have avoided alot of suffering if you had just used a condom . if you do not want another mouth to feed then just take birth control or use a condom . why should not fetuses have rights ? once they are a fetus , then eliminating them is technically killing them . and at nine months , they are no longer dependent on it ' s mother ' s blood , and therefore is technically a baby . at nine months , you are not killing a fetus , you are killing a baby . why do you assume the poster did not use birth control ? they said nothing about birth control ; only a statement on being pregnant and having an abortion . also , why do you make any assumptions about suffering ? according to the poster , suffering was avoided . condoms are not 100% effective . a childhood friend ' s younger sibling was the product of a failed condom , among other factors . nine months and nine weeks are completely different .	0

families can multiply a lot faster than you think . i am not sure of the correct time , but there is nothing that says it could not have happened in that time period . the incestually conceived sons went out and found other people and married whom they pleased . they could have married a women who had children , and had even more children . then they could have returned . that area that was so populated was nothing when sodom and gomorrah were destroyed , and any people living around it left . why else would lot ' s daughters commit incest to bring forth children ? except , of course , the evidence is totally against that . plus , there is the little matter of infant mortality . <repeated> and lack of resources . but hey , do not let common sense and evidence stop you .	1

" this case is about free inquiry in education , not about a religious agenda , " said patrick gillen of the thomas more law center in his opening statement . the center , based in ann arbor , michigan , lobbies for what it sees as the religious freedom of christians and is defending the school district . so , this statement is from a ' law center ' that is dedicated to defend the religious freedom for christians . yet , this is not about ' religion ' . why do i find that hypocritical .	0
i agree , it is we that it is ridicules that we have gotten so into controlling stuff that now we even have a way to control natural courses , but i guess like i said before if it is to stop your child from suffering a sickness then i guess that is okay ( still bad ) but better than just being a complete control freak , or being selfish yeah ! its a benefit to be able to do a thing like that . i am amazed that we have come so far in technology and science , but i think there is a line of what we can offer people . its not like they are gonna chose whether they want to have an egg or a bagel for breakfast .	0

i do not think i have ever heard of a church that reinstated a minister after he admitted he was gay . even upon a ' repentance ' . have you ? a lot of christians view homosexuality as a lot worse and darker sin than the bible makes it out to be - - they take that and it colors their view of a gay person as a person , which is taking it too far . gay people are right when they say that things like divorce are a lot more prevalent of a problem ; i think churches need to cool it some on the homosexuality thing and simply work on showing the love of christ . <allcaps> wow </allcaps> are we seeing the softer , gentiler jyoshu ? your snoopy avatar must be afecting you <happy> <tong>	1

the simple fact is , in a civilized society no one has the freedom to do whatever she wants with her own body . liberty unfettered by morality is the operative rule of anarchy , not civilization . at any given moment , each of us is constrained by hundreds of laws reflecting our moral responsibilities to our community . the most primal of those rules is the obligation of a mother to her helpless child . this is one of the reasons the public outcry against susan smith was so intense . strawman . the argument is not to do whatever one wishes with ones body . the argument is soley that one does not have to have another attached , ever , against ones will .	0
islam is very clear that mohammed received the quran from an angel . not god . as you may or may not know , satan is a fallen angel and islam is his religion which is proven by the hate , murder and death that it was built upon and has lived by since its founding . islam is no more built on hate , burder and death than christianity is . do i have to remind you of the inquisition , the holy land wars , the witch burnings , etc ? . <repeated> if you try to claim that what some islamic people have done represents the whole religion , then i can do the same with those things that i listed , only for the christian faith . and do not even get started again on satan being a fallen angel - yes , we know about your beliefs that angels do not have free will , and yet rebelled against god , so we do not need to go into any more of that garbage .	0

all they are really pressing for is basically for kids parents to tell their kids <allcaps> at home </allcaps> that god guided evolution without it contrasting directly with what the kids are being taught at school . personally , i see no problem with this , as long as they stick to the facts in any case . just glanmcing over the proposed changes , i am not seeing anything that is factually incorrect . but that is how creationism works - half truth . evolution is a theory but do not make it quite clear that in science the word theory does not mean half - assed guess , as it does in creationism . check out that little piece of * * * * that was added to the bottom of the patterns of cumulative change paragraph on page 7 . that is pure <allcaps> yec </allcaps> . and you are not a <allcaps> yec </allcaps> ?	1

yes we can create modern technological wonders . the pyramids , the twin towers , and meer . alas , as was so truthfully spoke by isaac asimov , " the saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom .

" there are some of us that are attacking innocent civilians , others who will not lift a finger to help out of sheer arrogance , others who are too decadent to do anything . and think of what other animals have built ( and for an actual purpose ) . take a look at a bee hive . it ' s so complex and so perfect for them . they built that . an ant hill is at least 20 times the size of an ant . that ' s 120 feet for us ( for a 6 foot person ) .	0
a bump of the topic . it seems that any evolutionist with any knowledge of this topic has either quit this board or been banned . yet there is no response by creationists . why is that ? is it that garioch is correct ? is it that creationists are making assertions without understanding what they are talking about ? if creationists are talking from a position of knowledge then there should be a creationist discussion of gastralia , their relative position to the sternum , the ossification of the sternum , the presence of a carina , and so forth . the continued failure of creationists to respond with intelligent discussion demonstrates their ignorance of the topic . therefore , any creationist assertions of the status of archaeopteryx must be considered as unfounded . one should not assume ignorance on the part of creationists . that is a mistake that too many evolutionists make . in the real world , we have people willing to say things they already know is not true . why should creationists be any different ? after all , they are people , too . but rather than accept that fact , evolutionists argue that creationists are ignorant of a subject when , in reality , they ( creationists ) were simply telling lies .	0
sounds contradictory to me ! so what is your point ? are you claiming that the tenets of christianity are in doubt because the several thousand denominations hold contradictory views ? science proceeds by challenges and contradictions . contradiction in science is not evidence of doubt but evidence of a field of advance . in religion , it is without question , a matter of the veracity of the ultimate truth . which of the thousands of christian faiths hold the truth ?	0

first thing i want to say is that i dont want to offend anyone but for me abortion was the best option . i also want to say that i love christ will all my heart . he has forgiven me for my sins and because ive had an abortion does not mean im not a christian and yes i was a christian when i did have an abortion . i had an abortion just this past june . . <repeated> i grew up in a christian home and was anti abortion most of my life but honestly i felt so relieved after having the abortion . i am so sorry to hear about what has happened to you . i hope you get away from this terrible man and surround yourself with people who love you . i must ask , though , why are you a christian ? you completely disagree with typical christian sentiments on abortion , you feel none of the purported guilt the religious movement implies is inevitable , you feel like you did the right thing , so why would you continue to profess to belong to this religion if you disagree with one of the major issues of the day ?	0
for me the reason i do not " give it credit " is that it ' s irrelevant - - i do not see how it matter either way way if sexual " orientation " is natural or not . it ' s a separate issue from the moral one . remember , it ' s natural for animals to do many things - - some species ' males impregnate the females and leave forever the female to raise the offsrping on it ' s own . but just because such behavior exists among animals does not make it moral in humans . in fact i ' d call it immoral . there are many such examples in the animal kingdom . natural does not mean it ' s automatically moral . then you would want me to be something god did not create me to be ? silly , i ' d say ! humans are part of the animal kingdom . mammals if i remember from biology . are you not an animal ? if not , maybe the mothership will come and pick you up soon .	1

i do not know what i think about this . personally , i believed that cain and seth did marry their sisters . i know , sounds like incest , and today that is what it would be . however , you need to remember that there were no exact set of laws at the beginning of the creation . almost all of god ' s followers were spoken to by him and were given visions and angels to tell them what to do . i do not believe it was considered incest till the law was written abolishing that sort of thing . i am not sure about him creating other women either , but you could be right . after all , i have found the idea of him creating life on other planets <allcaps> after </allcaps> the creation acceptable ( still wondering about the end of the creation where he stopped though ) so with that view in mind , i suppose it ' s possible . yea i agree with you on how there was no exact se t of laws at the beginning of creation . the reason i say that they most likely did not marry their sisters is mostly cause god gets mad at cain and places a mark on his head so everyone he runs across will not kill him unless they want to die a death 10 times worse than his . kinda just says that there are other people out there .	0

from an enviromental perspective , forest fires are crucial for certain species to survive . man made influences has created a situation where forest fires are too uncommon that certain species and plants are facing extinction . forest fires also serves the purpose of revitalise the forests and make them more ' healthy ' . but as i said , this is from the enviromental point of view . you are indeed correct that uncontralable forest fires are hazardous for humans who live nearby ( as well as property ) . as always , a trade - off must be made . i am not really surprised at the bush administrations lack of a forest management plan . he known for not being an enviromentally - friendly president . forest fires are usually a natural occurance . they are often good for the eco - systems . it ' s the man made disasters that are the problem . we can not stop forest fires , but we can keep the property damage to a minimum by thining forests , building access roads where posible to fight the fires , and have stricter control over timber harvests . often the timber companies over - cut certain areas , leaving the lanscape a barren , lifeless terrain , not suited for wildlife habitat . soil erosion can become a problem also , as the silt from the soil erosion pollutes the streams and damages the fish habitat . the government needs a good forest management plan for public lands , and more funding for personel to impliment the current programs of forest management .	0

this guy has been debating me for almost a year now . <repeated> i thought i would share one of his post with you . what do you guys think ? the pictures did not come out . <repeated> sorry about that . well , as usual the creationist is trying to make an arguement against science using their moral viewpoint . forget about all that pseudo science trying to discredit evolution and geochronology , all it comes down to is this : " my religion has the exact answers to questions about my origins , i do not like what science has to say on this subject " . its so much more succinct that way , i just wish they could be up front about it .	0
halifax , what part of philly is that ? <happy> i am ready for judgment day . <repeated> as you know the bible says that death comes like a thief in the night . <repeated> well maybe your bible does not say that . <repeated> sorry . <repeated> the nice part . i am surprised that you have even read the bible . presumably you are commenting on 1 thessalonians 5 : 2 , wherein paul admonishes the greeks to be watchful for the coming of god ? the funny thing is that all of my bibles say that .	1
both atheists and agnostics will tell you they see no evidence for the existence of any god . some will continue with " thus , there is not one " and other will continue with " as for the other , i do not know " . the agnostic position is obviously tentative , however even though the atheist does not explicitly state his position is tentative , you will be hard pressed to find an atheist who states " there is absolutely , positively , with out a doubt , no god at all " . that distinction may be irrelevant since they do say that no god that any religious person believes in exists . and that is what i was getting at originaly . still i think that the idea that the existence of all religious gods can be ultimately refuted based on the logic you bring up is invalid .	0
as i have mentioned many times in these forums , one ' s personal view of abortion ( i . e . , whether it should be prohibited or permitted ) has nothing whatsoever to do with whether roe v . wade should be overturned . if one supports the rule of law , then they would have to support the statement made by senator mccain . also , given that you do not like his stated position on gay marriage ( i . e . , that marriage is a state issue ) , it appears to me that you do not like democracy either . ah , so i do not like democracy , and yet it is you who in the post are telling me that i have to support mccain ' s statement . are you serious ? that sure does not sound like democracy to me . i also find it funny that you claim that i do not like democracy when my very post stated that i would be voting for the democrat party . but then , i guess if we do not support bushyboy and his fellow republicanazis , we must be against democracy , right ? get real , phyllis .	1

i did not misunderstand you at all . like i said , you are for persecuting religious people if they do not agree 100% with you . i have no problem with them preaching against gays in their churches and the privacy of thier homes . its when they crawl out from under their rocks that i have a problem . i also have absolutly no problem what so ever with them talking about jesus if only they would keep to the subject of jesus and leave all gay issues alone . unfortually paul has replaced jesus in many churches .	1

i agree , there is no place for religion in the world today . but would you say that there is place for faith ? i find that atheists often ( not always ) lack the ability to trust , making it difficult to have faith , even if it is just to have faith in the human capacity to redeem itself once is a while . it depends on what kind of faith you are talking about . do you mean ' having faith ' in actual things ? if so , then most definately . although the world can sometimes be a cruel and horrible place , it can also be a fantastic one , and seeing that ( as i am an athiest ) gives me some kind of ' faith ' in the human capacity , society , etc ( where as a religious person may well have the same reaction for their faith in god ) .	0
i did not have to <allcaps> choose </allcaps> to be heterosexual . it ' s the natural inclination , unlike homosexuality . <wink> and i did not have to choose to be homosexual . it is a natural inclination . i chose not to hide or lie about who i am . however you are the one who seems to be under the delusion that being gay is a choice . once again i ask you if it is just a choice then you choose to be gay this moment .	1
think twice about that . you come on here strutting your stuff that planned parenthood is lying or misleading and now everyone can see that you are the one who is misleading . now is not that ironic ! you are the only one defending them now . <repeated> the funny part it , planned parenthood had the stats as reasons why abortion should be legal ( or is legal ) . but wait ! as we established the number of people that died from abortions went down to under a thousand so this reason is still not accurate and is still misleading . anymore ideas ?	0

the thing is , though , that if marriage is privatized people can have freedom without " redefining the standard . " it is a way for us to allow all those oddball marriages without putting an " official stamp of approval " on them . liberals want to expand the government involvement in marriage to include gay marriages , thus putting society ' s approval on these things ( something that gets moralists very angry . ) conservatives want to continue the statist rewards for straight marriage only - a violation of the 1 4 th amendment . libertarians combine the best of both positions . their position ( privatization ) creates the freedom to marry , upholds the constitution , and avoids official approval of gay marriage at the same time . i think your idea has merit . however , before i would fully endorse it , i am interested in how you see it being implemented and administered from the standpoint of equal protection under the law .	0

yes , you are correct . i found that discrepancy and corrected my earlier post . i had not read far enough down in the original site to have seen it when i originally posted it . that ' s when i also was reading the other information that i linked . it gets curiorsor and curiosor . just a week or so ago fbi revealed that they had found more undiscovered explosives in the basement of mcveigh ' s accomplice . it ' s like a replay of the keystone cops . i can not prove this but i suspect it is a lot of this information that is not widely shared and talked about that drove bush ' s decision to remove saddam . if in fact saddam were implicated in the earlier wtc bombing and of course he tried to murder bush <hashtag> 41 </hashtag> , then bush had all the justification in the world to remove saddam . dear god . you really have not a clue about what your talking about . away with the birdies i think . yousef was responsible for the 93 bombing , and he himself had very broad associations with some of the al - qaeda hardcore ( osama said he did not know him and was in sudan while yousef stayed in peshewer ) . osama wasn ' t responsible for the 93 bombing , he wasn ' t responsible for bali and madrid and i do not care what the world media tells you . but by all means keep spouting your misinformation , i for one find it hilarious . the yousef - osama - saddam link is a conspiracy theory .	1

the fact is that these countries supplied trained terrorists that hijacked the planes that were used in the 9 / 11 attacks . the fact is that these countries are hosts of al qaeda training camps your ' proof ' that iraq deserves or military onslaught is a jordanian terrorist named zarqawi operating out of iraq . he was a terrorist in jordan before he moved to iraq , and there are still numerous al qaeda training camps in jordan that we have not addressed anyway , you have been asked to show that iraq has a single al qaeda terrorist camp which is protected or acquiesed by iraq i am surprised at the density of posters still attempting to tie zarqawi to saddam ' s government or ( prior to us occupation resistance ) al qaeda . his actions in iraq prior to the us invasion were limited to kurdish territory , where saddam was attempting to contain that rebellion , and zarqawi was never a disciple of bin laden . zarqawi ' s bio has been reviewed on the internet many , many times : <url> as to al qaeda training camps in saudi arabia , they do exist in spite of publicized saud government attempts to eliminate them . even the most naive poster with even a minute understanding of the saud steel grip on their nation should be able to comprehend that if the sauds did not want something , it would not be there . and need i mention pakistan ? <url> <url>	0
actually the apocrypha is made up of pre - christian texts , and late 4 th century is a bit of a stretch for the new testament , certainly all its component texts were widely accepted by the 2 nd century . i do not whether it is " generally accepted " that the text was altered , it seems to me that you are projecting your own views based on the hypotheses of some scholars on to biblical scholarship in general . 382 - 405 are the dates i have , under pope damasus i .	0

with regards to the cousins argument if a creature evolves into a new species would not the old species not exist any more ? no , say you have got 200 of some species . by some event , 100 member are seperated . now we have two groups of 100 . each group goes through different selections and they accumulate small changes . eventually , they will be different enough so that they are no longer able to interbreed . that does not mean one group automatically has to die so we remain at the same number of species . of course , one group might get some significant advantage which allows it to come back and ownzor the original area so the other group gets wiped out .	0

by definition , a theory is an explanation of observed facts and laws . it is supported by experiments upon which it is based , and is confirmed by experiments designed to test predictions based on the explanation . now where in that definition is the word fact either used or implied ? because when something passes every experiment thrown at it and when something fits observation better than anything else , then it ' s as near as damnit fact . we can get pedantic over this if you want , but the conclusion that reaches is that there are no facts .	0

i believe in spinoza ' s god who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists , not in a god who concerns himself with the fates and actions of human beings . i cannot imagine a god who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation , whose purposes are modeled after our own - - a god , in short , who is but a reflection of human frailty . neither can i believe that the individual survives the death of his body , although feeble souls harbor such thoughts through fear or ridiculous egotisms . a man ' s ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy , education , and social ties and needs ; no religious basis is necessary . man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death . scientific research is based on the idea that everything that takes place is determined by laws of nature , and therefore this holds for the action of people . for this reason , a research scientist will hardly be inclined to believe that events could be influenced by a prayer , i . e . by a wish addressed to a supernatural being . and stephen hawking , the only thing he has said was " i do not believe in a personal god " , which would make him a pantheist or deist at best .	0
go ahead , delude yourselves . that ' s what you do best . emoticonxrolleyes i love it when straight , christian folk who disapprove of gays seem to know so much about what it is to be gay - how it feels , how they became that way , the nature of their relationships and whether or not its something they can control . hey archangel - if you ever need brain surgery i know a fantastic auto mechanic you can talk to . emoticonxrolleyes	1
do not expect the recent retractions and exonerations to change that . one of the strongest , most - repeated findings in the psychology of belief is that once people have been told x , especially if x is shocking , if they are later told , “ no , we were wrong about x , ” most people still believe x . as twain and churchill knew , sometimes the truth never catches up with the lie , let alone overtakes it . as i wrote last summer in a story about why people believe lies even when they are later told the truth , sometimes people ' s mental processes simply go off the rails . absolutely true ! i discovered that with my fluoride research . <repeated> for whatever reason , most people take another ' s word for what the truth actually is instead of searching for it themselves . if the lie is an easier pill to swallow than the truth pill , they will take the lie . emoticonxfrazzled	0
are you kidding ? he ' s absolutely obsessed with the topic - - and not just on this website . how hilarious !

i guess you are reading it wrong , then . back then , marriage was a commitment to one another and did not have legal meanings . that ' s just it . if you want to go by the original definition of marriage , like so many anti - gay people talk about , no one who gets a marriage should get legal benefits . however , they would never be willing to give this up , so by denying gays the right of those same benefits for the same commitment , it is just pure and unadulterated bigotry . by the way , look at post <hashtag> 9 </hashtag> to see what i think of the whole civil union movement . so was dominating and enslaving of women . does not mean we should do it just because it has historicity . actually i have heard this idea by numerous people , on both sides of the issue . i can see the merits myself - - give couples ' benefits in a way that does not utilize a cultural and religious institution that has nothing to do with legality to begin with . that way at least cultural marriage does not have to be redefined to any extent and legal benefits would no longer be any sort of reflection of any one group ' s cultural and ideological views . by the way , what do you mean by ' anti - gay ' in your phrase ' anti - gay people ' ? that ' s always important to nail down .	1
<flush> ' for the scientist who has lived by faith in the power of reason , the story ends like a bad dream . he has scaled the mountains of ignorance ; he is about to conquer the highest peak ; as he pulls himself over the final rock , he is greeted by a band of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries .

by your logic , when the supreme court ruled that african americans were not citizens and that they were not entitled to protection by the constitution in dred scott v . sandford ( 1857 ) people should have just shut up and moved on . except in the dred scott case the court wasn ' t trying to determine whether slavery was a collective or individual right , or what the constitution applied to in regard to slavery .	0

i thought i got to the substance of your argument quite well , and prefer not to drone on with a million quotes . if you want to press your argument further you will need to construct an argument as to why " putting someone in the position " obligates you to sustain their life , and when doing so you may want to examine the consequences of that position , to see if you can apply it consistently . you put it theretherefore you are responsible for itisn ' t , in itself , an argument . you are , in effect , telling me that putting someone in a position that will inevitable leave them dead does not make you responsible for their death . if i fire a bullet at your head , while that bullet is in mid - air , i am no longer doing anything to hurt you , and you are fine . however , i have set in motion affects that will result in your demise . this makes me responsible for your death .	1
i know more about human nature than you do . i am beginning to not see much point in continuing this argument with you either , because you just can not seem to understand the fact that mr . horn wasn ' t found guilty of any wrongdoing . if you do not like it , take it up with the grand jury . maybe this is good publicity ; do not come to texas if you have plans to be a criminal otherwise you will get shot and the person you tried to rob will be hailed as a hero . that ' s the kind of message we need to be spreading ; be a criminal and die like a dog . based on what ? i never said mr . horn did anything legally wrong . he was well within the rights of the state of texas . i never argued otherwise . that does not change the obvious fact that he intended to kill the two men , which is the topic of the discussion at hand .	0

‘ the philosophy of experimental science … began its discoveries and made use of its methods in the faith , not the knowledge , that it was dealing with a rational universe controlled by a creator who did not act upon whim nor interfere with the forces he had set in operation … it is surely one of the curious paradoxes of history that science , which professionally has little to do with faith , owes its origins to an act of faith that the universe can be rationally interpreted , and that science today is sustained by that assumption . ' origins of science , whether truly started by those of faith or not , is irrelevant . whatever science was , it has become a body of knowledge , through application of reason .	0
we now still have light and dark moths . the only thing that has changed is the population ratio , assumably by * natural selection * . exactly . that the change in moth color was due to natural selection was first posed in about 1896 by j.w. tutt . the funny thing is that as pollution increased , the moths turned black , and then as the pollution was cleaned up , they turned white again . carbonaria have become pretty scarce .	0

chuz , the purpose of this summary is not to summarise your arguments as a whole - it is to summarise what your argument is up to this point . why not post just a summary of your position so far , as you see it - i can do the same , then you can continue with your argument ? there ' s no point in writing an argument , summarising it and then leaving the thread before i have had a chance to respond to even your argument ( never mind your summary ) . if you are going to simply ignore any criticisms of your reasoning , then i struggle to see the point of you repeatedly requesting a one - on - one debate in the first place - you essentially regress your argument to the ' because i said so ' that you are ( presumably ) hoping to avoid , it ' s just that there ' s slightly more detail . i see your point , iangb but i am not about to be leaving before you have had a chance to respond . i will not be " leaving " at all . you challenged me to produce an argument , so i am going to produce my argument . i will then summarize the argument , and you can respond to it and we can then discuss / debate those specifics that you have a problem with . truthfully , this is how i should have first responded to your challenge . doing it piece meal has only resulted in a less focused debate . - - chuz	0

is it now ? is it backed up by the stats ? what ' s your evidence aside from ' it sounds right to me ' ? but the same applies to most countries - particularly in the west . [ url = ' <url> and yet us school killings account for more deaths in this list than the rest of the world put together ( counting like - for - like situations , not rebel military actions such as in vietnam , pakistan or russia ) . look around , the greatest majority of gun - related violence occurs were people are not allowed to be armed , or have to go through great leaps and bounds to qualify for being armed . this is because the criminals who get their guns illegally and plans to use them to harm others know that their chances of encountering an armed victim are next to nothing , putting them in an near - absolute position of authority where they can do whatever they want . and the point is what exactly in this statement ? last i checked thailand and israel were arming school teachers because too many students were either being held hostage or murdered . after the teachers became armed these rates dropped . why ? because schools were no longer soft targets and threats could be met with deadly force immediately within a second ' s notice .	1

good start . now the question becomes where did the stuff for the big bang come from ? you see , this could go on for a while , because the next logical question is ' where did that stuff come from ' and so on . no one could ask the same thing about a god . the god of the bible is supposedly self existent . one could say that about the universe , but given the big bang hypothesis , that does not fly . so now what ? huck oh yes we can . invoking god is not an explanation for ultimate origins , it ' s the papering over of the absence of an explanation by declaring further application of the question off limits . simply declaring that god ' s origin does not need explaining does not make that so .	0

however one thing that works against evolution is this . it is just amazing that every creature on this planet did not evolve to use the sun as a source of energy and food in some way or another . almost all did . in fact , probably all that you are aware of did . even the energy in the steak that you eat came from the sun ultimately . the thing is that evolution seems to have resulted in an organism to take advantage of almost every form of available energy . and what energy is left by " higher " animals is used by others - insects , microbes - until there is little usable energy left . that even goes so far that there are some organisms that get their energy from geothermal sources - no light involved .	0
even george gaylord simpson , harvard high priest of evolution had to admit , “ in spite of the examples , it remains true ( as every paleontologist knows ) that most new species , genera and families appear in the record suddenly , and are not led up to by known , gradual , completely continuous transitional sequences . ” 50 gee , and in what year did he state that ? 2005 ? no way . 2000 ? no . 1995 ? nope . 1990 ? nah . 1985 ? could not be . without more information i can give an exact date , but seeing as how simpson died in 1984 , he must have said that at least 21 years ago ( and if he said it in the middle of his life / career , it would have been more like 60 years ago ! ) - he did not know back then what we now know .	1

but , what if , everything in the universe was originally " placed " pretty much where we see it now ? for me , this is like the idea that the speed of light was once very fast and has now slowed down . both ideas indirectly call god a liar . this is bad . if all of our experiments show the earth is 4.5 billion years old , then that is how old it is . if the bible says something different , then either god meant genesis for peoples past and now uses scientists to explain things better ( though i am uncomfortable with this idea as many scientists are atheists ) , or our puny minds , compared with god ' s , have not yet worked out how genesis and an old earth tie together .	0

this doesnt really add up to anything more than your musings so i will take up one point . respect for your mother and father is only relevant in a society where the nuclear family is the norm . there have been some societies where this was not the norm . im afraid to say this demonstrates another example of someone that believes the world is and always was as he lives it . respect ( or fear ) is necessary for a functioning society but not necessarily towards parents . <repeated> which is exactly what the commandment orders . sorry your mightiness , thank you for your graciousness of addressing us common folk . are you really that obtuse ? i swear you and easy share a brain . i clearly pointed out that this commandment talks about respect for authority . personally , i think this applies to single parents , families with 2 daddies , or children raised in an orphanage . yet i bet somehow in the formative years of the children , they are taught some form of respect for authority . how so ? i did not write it , i am just commenting on it . and again , i prefer to replace ' mother and father ' with authority . regardless , who says respect = fear ? maybe you and easy really do share a brain . <repeated> you both seem to think you can define words as you see fit to lend creedence to your arguments .	1
and some people were saying " they are just that close in showing how life could come from non - life .

at the risk of becoming embroiled in a seemingly heated exchange , i think i might interject with a little history . <repeated> to answer smiley ' s question : “ who wrote the constitution ? ” i would say the answer is found in the preamble to the document : “ we the people of the united states , in order to form a more perfect union , establish justice , insure domestic tranquility , provide for the common defense , promote the general welfare , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity , do ordain and establish this constitution for the united states of america . ” ( bold emphasis added ) if by " we the people " you mean a handful of self appointed persons with strong financial intrest in the running of the country . <repeated> the document is largely a copy of the theories of montesqieu and john locke .	1
dude , is that what you do ? a large amount of people disagree with you and you act ' shocked ' at how that could be possible ? grow up . i am shocked that people side with illogical arguments rather than logic .	1
ironically , when i have publicaly advanced the idea that god is generally compatable with evolution , i find that my agnostic and atheistic colleagues are generally comfortable with such ideas , but many believers are dumbfounded . i believe that ' s true , and as a " believer " ( creationist ) , here is what is hard to understand about that ; in matthew , 12:30 , jesus says " he who is not with me is against me , and he who does not gather with me scatters " . it is safe to say that both creationists and theistic evolutionists would accept that statement from jesus , and would seek to be " with " him , while agnostic and atheists would consider themselves " not with " him . yet theistic evolutionists are comfortable to ( usually politically ) be " with " agnostics and atheists , and separate themselves from creationists . if they are genuine christians , knowing about the warnings in the bible about false teachings , how can they be comfortable with that ? miller laments in several places throughout the book that atheists use evolution as a weapon against religion , and that it should not be that way - that it causes more strife between the two than should exist .	0
the invisible pink flying panda says you are wrong . prove that it does not exist . i take it you have no formal education whatsoever ? i take it you have no understanding of science , much less the scientific method ? you are just dumb . the age of the earth has not changed in decades . you can go look up old biology textbooks from the 6 0 s and the number is still the same . therefore either you are lying , or you are being fed lies . yeah , from 4.5 billion years to 4.500001 billion years . in terms of our lives , that ' s not important . it amazes me just how dumb creationists are . and you clearly are trying to rely on a attack on science to support creation . hence why many of us believe that creationism cannot be defend or supported on its own merits wow , what a group of rude , self important , pompous , pseudo intellectuals who will insult and personally attack a person for one grammatical error . i meant to say the <allcaps> universe </allcaps> has aged from 4 to 14 billion years old since i was in school but rather than deduce that you call me dumb and ignorant ? with all of your so called intelligence can you prove the universe is now precisely 14 billion years old ? can you prove neanderthal man was a human descendant ? because <allcaps> dna </allcaps> tests dont prove that out and yet phds and masters degreed scientists insist they are . that ' s why the bible say ' s that the wisdom of this world is foolishness to god .	1

your link to not go to a definition of marriage . ot goes to a link for the word : marauder - marauder - one who , while employed in the army as a soldier , commits a larceny or robbery in the neighborhood of the camp , or while wandering away from the army . so really what was your point cause you have not made one ! <repeated> if you think marriage is sacred then why are you trying to change what it is ? i can not say this enough times . <repeated> marriage is a word that describes a union between man and women . no one created the word marriage and then decided what it would apply to . someone saw and event and gave this event a word . <repeated> this would be marriage . this ' event ' has been sacred since as long as we have records to show . and now , some wish to make it sacred for themselves while destroying the sacred institute that the majority of us wish to keep .	0

anyone who finds themselves foolish enough to believe hitler was a christian , for whatever reason you want to believe , needs to look up the word ' propaganda .

we are human at conception . the sperm and ovary cells are human before they even connect . a fingernail clipping is human . what you mean is ; when do we become a person . no ! at conception we are a person and human . all living things belong to a species and the foetus is a living thing , for that reason a foetus must belong to a species , and that species is human . a fingernail is dead so cannot be considered a living human , nor will it develop into a human . the sperm only has half the chromosomes so is not human . the unique human is the key element here , if you cut your nail , the <allcaps> dna </allcaps> from the nail can be replicated by the living persons nail , a foetus when destroyed cannot have itself replicated , the unique <allcaps> dna </allcaps> that is destroyed will never be see on earth again , that individual has gone forever , howver , the man with the nail clipped is still alive .	0
the figures for the number of gun related deaths in the us should be evidence enough that ' the people ' cannot be trusted with guns . this does not mean all the people , but a large enough proportion of the people to be a danger the rest of you . so the fact that we still have criminals who choose to kill others , should be used against is in determining whether we can be trusted or not ?	1

as i said in my posting <hashtag> 39 </hashtag> by splitting hairs again and again you paralyse the debate . as instead of being a debate about abortion it has become a semantic nightmare . i do not see how this is not a debate about abortion . true , it ' s become mildly less concrete , but that ' s what happens when you try to get it right .	0
always a case that slips through the cracks . <repeated> well how about we focus on the genuine problem instead of making something else into a problem . instead of playing the game ' what new law can we pass now ' let us do something to focus on the one million dangerous gang members we have got running around free . they have been linked to 80% of the crimes committed in the country , there ' s no justified excuse for not going after them . does the grand canyon strike you as a ' crack ' as well ? like ? what makes them so dangerous if it ain ' t their guns and their willingness to use them ? this assumes that no da is presently going after them . something i highly doubt . diversionary tactic on your part . would not making guns harder for them to acquire be helpful ?	0
rather unsurprisingly , the u.s. constitution does not have any bearing on australian law . who said it did ? i was only pointing out the absurdity of gun control laws and how they lead to federal overlords deeming that your not capable of playing with matches .

at least with sport the best players are fairly easily identified , everyone can watch them in action and judge for themselves . with corporate officers it is much more ambiguous . there is no indication that firms are actually competing for the top talent , they just seem to be cycling around the same faces and awarding themselves ever larger pay rises . does the enormous pay of ceos help the economy ? probably not . would prohibiting enormous pay of ceos ( threatening to fine or imprison people if they violated an arbitrary cap on salaries ) help the economy ? certainly not . is rawls argument correct , and all that remains is for us to work out the details of a totalitarian state to enforce his ideals ? no .	0

umm . <repeated> i think the infringement of gay rights is kinda what we are discussing here , bucko . what rights of yours are being infringed by not infringing the rights of gays ? if you can not answer , maybe you should deal with that . wait so being bullied is infringing on your rights ? well no duh but if i ' bucko ' have to deal with it on a daily basis just for the fact that i am slightly different i am not surprised someone has to deal with it for their sexuality . and if they just dealt with the fact they were gay , accepted it and realized that other people are not the end all and be all , that they ' d eventually find people who accepted them for who they were and that high school wasn ' t the world maybe they ' d still be alive .	1

lets break this down . most pro - choice advocates think that intelligence is when human life starts , or consciousness or self awareness is what makes an embryo have rights . the lifers say that it should have rights regardless of its physical state . and yet , for most pro - choice folk on these forums , this question really is meaningless . for , even when it is assumed by these folk that the embryo has rights , they nevertheless argue that abortion is still acceptable . even you believe this shooter .	0
to bad they could not work the same magic on their next republican president . maybe clinton better understood the downside of deficit spending and its effect on future generations . or , since he did not have $37 - million tucked away from questionable business practices and a rich daddy , perhaps he paid attention to the ramifications of abnormal deficit spending .	1
you did not answer my question . <repeated> toe says all structures evolved by small , random modifications . surely , then you are not saying that whole structures such as feet formed complete . <repeated> that would be a contradiction now would not it . <repeated> so answer my question : what about the feet ? which foot came first ? there are more to feet and other body parts besides bone . <repeated> muscles , tendons , toenails . <repeated> did all these evolve at the same time from the same mutation ? . <repeated> if not , in which order ? as i recall the order of feet was left front foot , right hind foot , left hind foot , and finally right front foot . does that make you happy . oh yes the genes involved are known as peds and numbered in order 1 - 4 . ped1 and ped4 are mirror images of each other ( obtained by a process known as reflective copy ) and ped2 and ped3 are much the same . this is of course entirely logical and could have been directed or random . the first critter to bear such feet was known as the ftse not to be confused with the index . its predecessors were of course the gimpy series since they had 1,2 , or 3 feet and had to hobble along with what they had . ftse - 1 is sometimes known as pogo because of its odd ' gait ' .	0
just read the following story . my question is thus , should this child be put to death per bible based rules governing a child ' s unruleiness ? you know , if the god deniers even let the baby out of the mother ' s womb alive to begin with then he ' s already one step ahead of the game . as for what to do with him then , show me under the new covenant where jesus said to stone kids ? personally , i think we should stone obese , jaded statues of weird looking holy men .	1
you are completely wrong and delusional . absolute power corrupts absolutely . fine lets just all be on our own , fuck government , fuck state , fuck town , fuck family , lets all do what we feel so long as it makes us happy . there has to be an order to things if not there will be chaos , history has proven this time and time again , but if you think that ' s the way to live be my guest , you will not live to long , the universe seeks balance and order not chaos . yes power will corrupt this is the reason for the system we have , like family , town , state , government and un to prevent the power hungry from taking over , it is up to us to prevent that from happening , we the people are the world not some lone wolf .	1
it ' s about looking for a point in spacetimewhere none applies . covering the entire universe , not for specific examples within the universe . i am surprised no one has mentioned the subject of quantum mechanics in this thread . it seems to be a very good example of the concept , instead of perhaps parallel lines . the fact that things can exhibit mutually incompatible properties of either a particle or a wave depending on how we observe them is incomprehensible , yet certainly reality , no ? and i think this is just one example of the apparent incomprehensibility of qm . . .	0

i suspect that this will not be considered reasoned debate as it is disagreement with the anti dp stance . the rate of recidivism that produces dead innocent victims by paroled criminals far out weights the number of executed innocent men . fix the judicial system . make lawyers and law enforcement accountable for the errors that lead to deadly mistakes . quit making future victims pay for incompetence in law enforcement . dead murderers do not murder again . tugging at heart strings over the death of a murderer or the terror he feels on the way to the chamber gets no response . no joy , no sorrow . but you are forgetting life - without - parole ( and i do mean <allcaps> without </allcaps> parole ) . with life without parole , there is also no recidivism .	0

in a way , taking rights away is an american value since we have prescribed methods for doing it . for instance , we have legislatures which posess authority to remove a large number of what you likely consider to be rights . here are just a small number that come to mind : 1 ) right to murder2 ) right to own slaves3 ) right to rape4 ) right to abusing children5 ) right to vote6 ) right to smoke ( if you are under 18 ) 7 ) right to drink ( 1 8 th amendment ) <happy> right to engage in certain activities in public9 ) right to drive as fast as one wants10 ) right to dump dangerous chemicals in the nearest riverthe list goes on really . the fact is that you do not object to taking rights away in principle , you only object to taking away those rights that you wish to retain . that is quite inconsistent . where do you get the idea that one has a right to perform an abortion anyway ? in what universe is there a right to murder ? unfortunately , we in the united states have only recently recognized that abusing children and owning slaves is not a right . and , only recently have women enjoyed the right to vote in the united states . what certain activities are forbidden in public ? some of the conservative red states have only recently decreed that there should be speek limits . not for safety reasons , of course . and , george walker bush has guaranteed the right of corporations to dump dangerous chemicals into lakes and rivers and the oceans .	0

this is what it has come down to . the scientific world is in sad , sad shape . it ' s pathetic , really . <repeated> yet all you anti - intellectuals will soak it up like a sponge . do you want to explain what you think the problem is ? you are going to see a much larger change if you start fiddling with the controls than if you were replacing bases within the protein coding sequence - a lot of those would not change anything in the protein , and a lot of the changes to the protein would not have a significant effect either .	0

furthermore , law abiding citizens can sell their guns to criminals in private transactions . in these transactions , the purchaser is not required to pass a background check so how can the seller be sure whether or not the buyer has a criminal history ? so ban guns ? that is like curing the headache by cutting off the head . why not make it a crime to sell a gun privately . perhaps make it a legal requirement to go to a licensed firearms dealer who at no charge to the parties other than the cost of the background check run the potential buyer through the database . i would certainly be willing to do this . as a responsible gun owner , i would hate to think that the firearm i was going to sell to someone might be going to a felon , or someone likely to use it to commit a crime .	0

personally i do not give rats rear end about your god - neither he , you , the government or the ignoramous in rome will ever have say in what happens to this body . yes there are - and as long as you continue to trivialize and disregard them you will not to a damned thing to reduce abortion . have you ever considered the possibility that he cares about you ? that he knows you ? and that he cares about those in the womb ? this is always the charge hurled at me but it is never founded . you cannot find any misogyny in my writings but rather a great respect for women and their value and dignity . this is why i argue so strongly against abortion . yet , any oppression , or insecurity , or hardship , or difficulty they face , though real and challenging , is not justified in the face of destroying the life in the womb . though abortion reigns freely and forcefully and abundantly still the oppression and abuse of women endure . one reason they endure is that people are looking in the wrong place for a solution - - they are looking to abortion when it offers no solution .	0
from what i understand of christianity . <repeated> you are gonna burn , buddy . sorry , but that ' s where i think you ' d fall according to that . personally , i do not think so . i think if there is a god and it ' s anything like i picture , you will be fine . question , what are the seven deadly sins you have committed ? but wouldnt it mean that if she ( if phunting is female ) burns in hell , that would mean that god really exists . do you believe in god ? also , do you think that if god really does exists that he ' s just bluffing about that hell stuff ? hmm <elongated> . <repeated>	1
so guns are more important than the safety of women ? then the right of women abandoned by their husbands to know about the financial situation of their spouses in a divorce case ? so men love their guns more than women ? is that some kind of homosexuality ? ya know a gun is kind of shaped like , um , you know what . a gun does ejaculate in a sense . i would agree with you , but first of all , the owner of the show has every right to not allow cameras . second , it would be a huge invasion of privacy if all women knew what their ex wives could keep spying on what they buy and what they do . they have no buisness doing that . very funny , but just because men do not want their rights violated by nosy ex wives and their lawyers and pis , does not mean that they love their guns any more than they do women . its simply a hobby . men do not insist on following women around , watching everything they buy and everything they do , do they ? men are entitled to guns just as women are entitled to manicures . our rights are going out the window fast .	1
i will not throw my ideas on abortion out there just yet , but i have to ask this question . should fathers have to pay child support considering a mother could have mitigated the expense by having an abortion ? for example : jack is 55 and makes 20,000 a year . jack gets injured by bob , and can no longer work unless he gets a $1000 operation . jack ' s religion or other views preclude getting the operation , so he sues bob for $200,000 , the wages he will lose over the next ten years . since jack could mitigate his losses by having the operation , nost likely all he will be entitled to is $1000 . so - should not child support be limited to the cost of an abortion , under our current pro - abortion laws ? this is more of a legal question involving whether or not it was negligence ( sp ) . if so , you can not really sue for amounts of money you <allcaps> might </allcaps> get in the future . he could sue for lost pay on the job and other medicial procedures . so ya know <happy> . i do not really know what the question is .	0
ah yes the oldest con game in the world . set up the game so its impossible to comply with the rules , then use the guilt effect to control the test subject . the christians have managed to commercialize the whole concept on a mass scale . and even if a test subject thinks it has won the game and exhibits no guilt - there is always the mythical original and heritable sin to fall back on . in adams fall we sinned all . guilt is the father of . <repeated> economic returns ! so i take it you do not accept my challenge on the basis that it is impossible ? why is it impossible ? or better yet , why do not we al just evolve into perfect , anti - sinning creatures with 500 iq points a piece ?	1
give to god what belongs to god . give to science what belongs to science i see the similarity with the original scripture , in which jesus was recognizing the authority of both god and caesar in the world . however , jesus was talking about the political power in the world . jesus called the academics of his day , vipers and hypocrits , because they pretended to be holy but were evil . he called the wisest of men fools , because they did not believe in god . also , as i stated before , truth should be the ultimate goal . i do not fear science . i do not see any truth that science may happen to reveal as a threat to faith . why ? because god is truth . jesus said , " and the truth shall set you free " ! <repeated>	0
can someone explain to me how noah took mosquitoes on the ark ? those abominations need sitting water to hatch and develop . a boat being toss around like a toy is hardly going to have pools of sitting water . plus what did all of the insectivores eat for 40 days ? emoticonxbye actually , the storm lasted for 40 days and 40 nights . the ark was actually afloat for a year or so . so i guess the answer is that the ark had all kinds of pestilent insects winging about and biting and stinging the occupants . the problem is , how did these aquatic breeders actually propagate in the feces and urine infested bilge of the ark ?	0
i keep hearing gays say that but every time it ' s put to a vote , you lose . i ' d say that it ' s time to try another tact because the current one is a losing proposition . the only thing forcing gay marriage on a population does is galvanize them against the forced action . and when they respond on the ballot , they do so punatively . just wait until you see the repercussions of the current efforts to give <allcaps> all </allcaps> federal employee ' s same sex partners bennies on <allcaps> our dime </allcaps> despite <allcaps> doma </allcaps> . i am guessing that some additional democratic heads will roll in the fall election if that flies . you need a pr strategy that highlights the advantages of gay unions over bathhouse and gay bar existences . i believe that a true majority of people would support civil unions but <allcaps> not </allcaps> marriage . and i count myself amongst that majority . actually jp so far 5 states have passed gay marriage so no not every time it is put to a vote do we lose . and how am i forcing anyone to accept gay marriage ? am i forcing these voters to attend my wedding or dare i say be in a marriage themselves ? and i cannot agree with you more about changing the image of the gay community as a whole . <repeated> we are not all a bunch of promiscuous sex crazed people running around . <repeated> what i find funny is once strait people find out how boring we really are , and how we pay taxes just like every other joe schmo they will think nothing more of special rights lol . <repeated> but actually like i stated earlier in another thread if those unions constituted the same legal rights as married couples i would be content .	0
if anything , the special dependant class already exists in the form of the heterosexual married couple , funded by the rest of society , married or not . any " loopholes " that exist are now only to the exclusive benefit of heterosexual married couples . i have never disagreed that marriage is a special dependent class . my point is that it is a society - sanctioned special class .	0
nope . the first part is factual . only those who want to see saddam as a martyr will do so . the last part are currently 3 types who seem to be calling him one . the only one ' s who have called him a martyr in the hours of media on this subject i have covered have been small bands of his former followers , a daughter in jordan iirc in a protest . <repeated> and liberals and the media who repeat such claims . i am surprised at your response since i see your posts as well considered and stated . i asked the question and you answered . to me it was clearly , by definition , inflammatory . we can agree to disagree and let readers make their own determination .	0
many died at the hands of slavery . but it ' s beside the point . pointing out bad things that have happened in christianity in no way refutes that good things have happened as well . you are arguing from a position of complete nonacceptance of good from religion . i am arguing both : that religion has been good <allcaps> and </allcaps> bad . you are <allcaps> only </allcaps> arguing the bad and can not bring yourself to accept ( or admit ) that it has and can also be good . and when that good is pointed out with real examples , you change the subject to something that ignores the point , such as " ignorance is never good " or something like that . well , it ' s <allcaps> not </allcaps> ignorant for mel white to believe in equality . so religion is not always ignorant , either . what good has come from religion ? none that i can see .	0

i would like to point out that it was hardly a land slide . current admninistration is not as popular as either reagan or clinton was . this nation is divided . nothing is dead . george bush won the majority of votes ( the first majority winner in 16 years ) in an election with the highest turnout in us history ( > 1 1 7 million voters ) . the senate minority leader was defeated by a nobody . democrats lost at least 3 seats in each of the house and senate , something that never happens in a presidential election year . this gave the republican majority in both branches of congress even more control . 11 liberal ballot initiatives went down in flames by huge margins . if liberalism <allcaps> isn </allcaps> ' t dead , then it ' s in <allcaps> icu </allcaps> on a heart and lung machine . emoticonxrolleyes	0

not only that , to suggest that untold numbers of women would seek illegal abortions is a question - begging claim that has no grounding in history , logic , or reason . it is an unfounded , unproven claim . it is a betrayal to sound judgment to make decisions based upon unfounded predictions into the future . but it is based on history . there is plenty of history showing that women had illegal abortions . or , if their families had money . went to costa rica or britain to have a legal one in those countries . women died or had severe medical emergencies due to illegal abortions . doctors and nurses were prosecuted for providing these services .	0

a chance mutation can do this by insertion . the codons for one protein are inserted or appended to the codons of of another . this is especially likely if the genes are near eachother . another means by which this can occur is in the folding of the proteins . two proteins can fold such that they interact because of their shape . if the proteins interlock or attach , they can form new combined structures . folding proteins . <repeated> show me where and how this happens . why is it that one protein is able to fold into the right shape to attach itself to another ? if this is happening all the time we ' d see more mutations all the time . good theory you have got there . saying something can happen does not mean that it does !	0

court : seattle police ok to stun pregnant womanby <allcaps> gene johnson associated press writerseattle </allcaps> - - three seattle police officers were justified when they used a stun gun on a pregnant mother who refused to sign a traffic ticket , a federal appeals court ruled friday in a case that prompted an incredulous dissent . malaika brooks was driving her son to seattle ' s african american academy in 2004 when she was stopped for doing 32 mph in a school zone . she insisted it was the car in front of her that was speeding , and refused to sign the ticket because she thought she ' d be admitting guilt . rather than give her the ticket and let her go on her way , the officers decided to arrest her . one reached in , turned off her car and dropped the keys on the floor . brooks stiffened her arms against the steering wheel and told the officers she was pregnant , but refused to get out , even after they threatened to stun her . the officers - sgt . steven daman , officer juan ornelas and officer donald jones - then stunned her three times , in the thigh , shoulder and neck , and hauled her out of the car , laying her face - down in the street . brooks gave birth to a healthy baby two months later , but has permanent scars from the taser . she sued the officers for violating her constitutional rights , and u.s. district judge richard jones allowed the case to continue . he declined to grant the officers immunity for performing their official duties and said brooks ' rights were clearly violated . but in a 2 - 1 ruling friday , a panel of the 9 th u.s. circuit court of appeals disagreed . judges cynthia holcomb hall and diarmuid f . o ' scannlain held that the officers were justified in making an arrest because brooks was obstructing them and resisting arrest . the use of force was also justified because of the threat brooks posed , hall wrote : " it seems clear that brooks was not going to be able to harm anyone with her car at a moment ' s notice . nonetheless , some threat she might retrieve the keys and drive off erratically remained , particularly given her refusal to leave the car and her state of agitation . " they also noted that the force used wasn ' t that serious because the taser was in " touch " mode rather than " dart " mode , which hurts more . they reversed the lower court ' s opinion and held that the officers were entitled to immunity from the lawsuit . the officers ' lawyers , ted buck and karen cobb , said the officers made the right decision under the circumstances they faced . " police officers have to have the ability to compel people to obey their lawful orders , " buck said . that ' s all the court recognized today . the 9 th circuit just applied the law instead of getting caught up in the otherwise unfortunate factual circumstances . " the majority ' s opinion outraged judge marsha berzon , who called it " off the wall . " " i fail utterly to comprehend how my colleagues are able to conclude that it was objectively reasonable to use any force against brooks , let alone three activations of a taser , in response to such a trivial offense , " she wrote . she argued that under washington law , the officers had no authority to take brooks into custody : failure to sign a traffic infraction is not an arrestable offense , and it ' s not illegal to resist an unlawful arrest . berzon said the majority ' s notion that brooks obstructed officers was so far - fetched that even the officers themselves did not make that legal argument . to obstruct an officer , one must obstruct the officer ' s official duties , and the officers ' only duties in this case were to detain brooks long enough to identify her , check for warrants , write up the citation and give it to her . brooks ' failure to sign did not interfere with those duties , she said . furthermore , brooks posed no apparent threat , and the officers could not have known how stunning her would affect the fetus , or whether it might prompt premature labor - another reason their actions were inexcusable , berzon said . brooks ' lawyer , eric zubel , said he would ask the 9 th circuit to rehear the case . " this is outrageous - that something like this could happen to a pregnant woman , in front of an elementary school , at 8:30 in the morning , to someone who posed no threat whatsoever , " he said . for anti - choicers , it ' s just about control and power over women . they do not care about life . ( except their own . ) this same mother could be a person who did not have access to pre - natal care . they would not defend that right either . because they <allcaps> don </allcaps> ' t care about the fetus . they do not care about life . they do not care about health . they care about power and money and pushing people around . that ' s all .	0
wow . talk about mental problems in a can . <repeated> not the issue . you claimed my signature is not valid and proves nothing . therefore you must disagree with it . therefore if you disagree with it , you consider that christanity is the sole religion on the planet . irrelevant . you disagree with my signature . therefore you believe that every other religion except christanity is not a religion . i suspect you do not actually believe this and you are just trying to cover up for your giant cockup . if you actually believed that christanity was the sole religion on the planet , you ' d have no problem walking into a mosque or a synagogue or a temple and saying to all those believers that their religions do not exist . child , your assumption is not only simplistic , childish and patently ridiculous , but it is coming from you so i am not surprised at all that you are making it . you can deduce and somehow read into my rejection of your statement being evidence of anything is claiming that christianity is the only religion , but i made clear above that my only intent was to show that your claim that your siggy proves anything at all is patently absurd . but make of it what you will . i will give you the last word to spew your lies and delusions about what you want to say i believe . so have at it little boy , er , i mean , child . emoticonxbye	1

but what you do not seem to get is that this will probably happen by default . it ' s not a matter of ' potential ' , it <allcaps> will </allcaps> happen in most cases unless outside intervention ( killing it ) takes place . that ' s beyond potential ; that ' s the rule . an unfertilized egg cannot become a person ; an embryo more than likely <allcaps> will </allcaps> unless something external kills it . you are inaccurately minimizing the difference there , <allcaps> imo </allcaps> . one will likely " become a person " , the other will absolutely not . maybe you are not aware , but something that has not happend but has a possibility or probability of happening is potential , so the word is accurate to describe it . and since i am sure steve <elongated> ( the dictionary worshipper ) will step in , here is the definition :	1

look , i lost my response ; i am not going to retype it because in hindsight i was just repeating the same thing : you and i both know the issue is the morality of the act , choice is meaningless because all the law is , is the use of force to prevent ( or prevent further ) immoral choices . me condemning something as immoral is the same as advocating it be outlawed which is the exact same ' making a decision ' as telling someone that just because they can kill others does not mean it ' s their choice . the high dollar question is whether the fetus is human , biologically it is ; not at the time all that a human can be but none of us ever achieve that . you said you are concentrating on 9 months , i do not see a difference you can abort child rearing just as easily after birth by killing the child or abandoning it . i assume you take the position life begins at conception and biological potential is sufficient to claim to be a human . then why do we stop at a fertilized egg ? if you mean potential , is supposed to become , or posses the correct dna to one day be then birth control would fit under birth control as would masturbation for you abortion is the immoral act of killing a human being . if we say based on results then killing is killing . the reasons are irrelevant , there is no difference between abortion , capital punishment or self defense . yes these are extreme , but its where your position leads . at some point we make a choice and say that goes to far , but then we are back at choice and what is to much for one and not enough for another .	0

the minimum drinking age should be lowered to 14 if not 12 . the main problem with alcohol is drinking habits , non - safe drinking habits are encouraged by a high age of license due to how alcohol is more likely to be consumed in bulk and away from proper supervision for those underage . laws prohibiting underage drinking fail to do such , and actually end up causing some of the situations they are meant to avoid . rather then alcohol being another part of life , used in moderation around family and good friends well supporting the economy by actualizing more of the demand for it . it is given the allure of the forbidden fruit , consumed as fully as possible whenever possible because its seen as a rare item to behold , and often consumed around shady suppliers or swigged from stolen bottles . 14 or 12 . <repeated> that is a ridiculous statement . drinking can affect the brain growth , and it goes through it most radical transformation at that age . oh yeah let us all stuff up the new generations brains and crap . <repeated> smart idea . if they were able to dink legally at that age it would encourage more to drink . many around that age are not able to find alcohol really . it would make the situation worse than making it better . <repeated> the increase of binge drinking would also increase , it is at where it now because usually a person of that age , if they are able , cannot acquire a high amount of alcohol .	0
