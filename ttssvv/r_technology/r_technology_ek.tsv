i do not agree with your definition of schools . some schools should be dedicated to a certain subject . i do not know which level of schooling you are referring to but , yes , one should be introduced to many subjects in their beginning of the education , but then a person needs to hone in on the subject they enjoy , refine the skills there .	0
this is exactly what i meant .	0
coding involves skills that are incredibly applicable to many other activities . the ability to take a large complex system and break it down into chunks that can be handled by the realtively limited set of commands and functions in a programming language is what a lot of other things really boil down to . the problem with teaching it in elementary school is twofold . first is the fact that there is still a depressingly large percentage of teachers , particularly at the elementary level , who would , if given the chance , never touch a computer . second is the matter of time . they are already trying to do too much with too little time .	0

nothing has been proven to the point that a company has won a lawsuit . basically what happens is that a couple bad reviews pop up on your yelp page . for some reason , yelp ' s algorithm sorts them to the top of the comment page . yelp then emails you about an offer to advertise with them . if you do then you get control over how yelp sorts the reviews , and thus can hide or bury bad reviews .	0

people people people . every one seams to think we need jobs but have you ever thought about the reasons why capitalism , socialism and communism , fail to make people happy ? [ other than universal happiness being impossible ] it is because of jobs . those economic systems require people to work to prove their value . why should we have to get a shit job at mcdonald ' s to do what we want ? why should people have to work when they do not want to ? why do we need jobs ? the answer has always been because no one else will do them , but now some one else could do them in the near future . robots can do those jobs . the only reason this is bad is because people need to work to show value , but what if they did not ? what if we took these robots and split their output equally ? so everyone could live better ? what if we automated every thing so no one has to do something they do not want to do . something they are forced to do simply because no one else will , and people need to work to be of value ? we could keep excess production in a free market wile ensuring everyone gets a share to live comfortably . its not socialism because that has people doing shit jobs this would be something different something were the proletariat are mindless machines and the general populace is neither a working man nor a capitol owner .	0

having grown up with politics , and decided to <allcaps> gtfo </allcaps> and stay away from it , from the bottom level up to the top , i know intricately how it works , and who really runs the place . unless you get rid of all at the top , and remove those who pay them under the table , you do not change a thing . at this point , feeding the country shows like honeybooboo is only to make people dumber and less caring , and sadly , for about 50% of the population , it works . i feel dumber watching it , and my wife has since quit watching tv for the most part , because its nearly all shit to make your brain quit working on those critical thinking skills that we all once had . critical and logical thinking is the most dangerous enemy to an institution as that which currently runs the country , since people could apply a little bit of critical thinking and logic , and very easily arrive at the conclusions that i have already clearly seen with my own eyes . nothing will change tho , even if i were to rise up , i get tossed in a mental house as a nut , with some faked health condition , and forcefed meds till my mind stop ( not the first time rulers in history have done it ) . for a revolution to truly work , the people must rise up , en masse , but i do not see that happening , ever again , in this country . i have seen how corrupt and dirty the underside of the world is , with my own eyes . i was there , and i got out ( no , its not like the mob , they do not kill you , because they know a single person cannot do any damage , because it can be either played off on a scapegoat , as a crazy person , or bought , tho murders do happen , it would not be the first time i guess ) . once your out of politics , you are out for good tho , and are not welcome back . so , here i sit , knowing how it really works , and yet still being unable to do a thing about it . money does truly make the world run , and can get you anything you want if you have enough of it .	0

<allcaps> amd </allcaps> usually thinks ahead , but they do not have the tremendous drive or budget that intel has , nor is windows even optimized for their architecture ! ever since bulldozer , it has been shown that the windows scheduler has been lacking and somewhat inept with thread scheduling and it ' s modular design . windows 8 was supposed to fix the issue , but nothing was done . once windows 8 finally dropped , nobody anywhere was talking about the promised fixes - because they fizzed out . so we are somewhat supposed to believe that huma will just magically work from the get go ? i think that windows will once again be the thorn in their side . same thing happens with all new instruction sets they come with - <allcaps> avx </allcaps> , fma4 , <allcaps> xop </allcaps> , etc - who really takes advantage of all of those ? so will pc gamers be reaping any rewards ? no . it ' s important that they get the contract though , it ' s extra cash and it will get developers more focused on multithreading , which has been something of a slow transition .	0

that is not to say that many operators do not use triangulation . the one i work for does not though . in fact , the only way we assist the police is with the latest tower the cell phone was connected to , the time and the ( very ) approximate direction , and they have to pay every time . granted , if it is in a densely populated area it can be narrowed down to quite a small area due to the density of towers , but it is still not tracking per se .	0

i was just trying to point out that google may have leaders who are not as evil , but all decisions made must have mutual benefit for their vision and whatever customers want , otherwise you will not come to a mutual agreement . even if their quality dips , you agree to the decision by not asking for a reduction in whatever cost you pay , meaning that you value the service or goods at whatever value you pay . if you say you have no other options , then you are still valuing this service or good at whatever you are paying . in the end , people are just trying to lowball other people and despite having a set value in mind , would want to argue for even lower costs just because .	0

no , but they did not actually push the envelope . not like public perception suggests . we are people being lazy ? sure . but apple did not accomplish anything impossible or mind blowing . they just started from scratch , had a more modern ui , and good marketing . if any of the competition had strived to use capacitative touch screens and given their os a badly needed update , they ' d basically have an iphone . arguably with more functionality on launch . and the ipad was definitely a boost in specs for tablets , but it was also a step down in functionality . it treats it solely as a mobile device , and we are still struggling with the notion that large tablets beg to be productivity devices but are limited by their os and firm factor . apple did not solve that problem . they worked around it .	0

perhaps it ' s the whole hating of google tieing everything together or wanting you to give them all of your information . i had google + prior but only used it when i was asked to check it out in its beta phase . since then , i have never shared anything , added friends , or uploaded pics and it will remain that way . i have the other social networks for that and youtube for itself . i think in my situation , too , that i was able to make a nick like here on reddit since i was able to sign in via my gmail and create ( or possibly change ) the name of my youtube persona / channel . i am trying to think back as to how i did the name change , and i think it was something with me going through the profile settings and then changing it . i guess now , they probably make you use your real name * * for the google + * * side , and then let you set a name for your youtube channel , which , i think , will be the name everyone will see across youtube besides your real name .	0

there are some posts with the facts , but they have like 10 upvotes usually and are hard to find . i saw the original thread like 2 days ago and so far from what i have learned is that his s4 got burned charging overnight and instead of just giving it to samsung to inspect and replace he creates a youtube video bashing samsung and showing his burned s4 charger port . so now samsung asks him to remove the video so they can inspect the device and figure out what happened , but instead reddit blows it up into samsung trying to silence and gag the guy from talking about his s4 . if you watch the video the guy is so unprofessional and can not even properly upload the contract , he makes a facebook post . this whole thing is so childish and unprofessional , but since it ' s anti - samsung everyone reads the title and starts to comment without looking at anything . hope this helps .	0

they are unifying their services this is absolutely the correct business decision . you are demanding they do the opposite because you want the free service to do less for them and more for you . this is entitlement considering you do not pay them a cent . if you want a service that does not require you to do anything go with a premium pay service , this is not the model google follows . then again even paid services require you make a simple fucking account .	0

" <allcaps> one </allcaps> reason it will take windows <tong> to take a while before disappearing completely is the custom applications developed in the enterprise environment that run on it . in my office we have certain customized apps that will not run on wndows vista / 7 . now one of the bosses said ( non - it bosses mind you ) , why do not you re - write the source code to make these apps work on win 7 ( 64 bit ) . well , the it guys tried to estimate the cost for just one application . after they had done preliminary work to estimate the requirements for the updated app , the real needs , and some " " wants " " , the budget for just one app re - write was closer to $0.25 million . the original app was developed by a coder who did coding for fun and now does not work for the company . it cost very little to the company since it was not developed with any formal requirements . the problem is that anytime you want to re - write an app today , people will say , oh since you are re - writing the code , please add this feature or this requirement or this functionality and since a lot of these needs and sometimes wants make sense , it ends up being an expensive undertaking and then since nobody has that kind of budget , well , there goes the will to update ! just my $0.02 from a real - life experience "	0

wrong , if the value comes from speculative hoarding then the bottom can fall out of the market . the value needs to come from usage , which will drive the price up since more value will be exchanged using the currency . currently it ' s not practical to use bitcoin to trade certain things because the network is not valuable / liquid enough .	0
bitcoin does not need paypal . think of paypal as a tax . except the cut they take does not do any good but line pockets of the hard working software developers .	1
is it web scale ? it will not beat facebook if it ' s not web scale .	0

ah , you are working , how pathetic . thanks for keeping up with reddit though . your ego really has made my day !	0
tangibility has been hugely important to currency for centuries . people shit bricks in the us when we went of the gold standard because they thought the money would be worthless . gold and silver can not be duplicated but it is possible to counterfeit paper currency and especially bit - coins . the perceived value of bit - coins will mean nothing if someone figures out a way to make a billion of them overnight .	0

that ' s because people who are riding bicycles cant get to the correct speeds fast enough and essentially drive with their own rules : usually not using proper turn signaling and riding wherever they please . if the speeds a bike can go are increased , the state would have to issue bicycle licenses for this specific bike ( because its over the street legal limit ) and bicyclists would have to follow the rules of the road or risk getting pulled over . since that will likely occur , i see no reason why these would be treated any differently from a motorcycle or moped .	0

this is true , and there is also another part of this that people are not paying much attention to : wireless networking . we have the capability to build wireless networks where each antenna can broadcast for several miles . there is a bunch of available spectrum for such a thing and the speeds with channel bonding would compete with cable ( super wifi they are calling it ) . however , the <allcaps> fcc </allcaps> is currently entertaining the option of selling a big chunk of that spectrum to the companies lobbying the government for it instead of opening it up for unlicensed use which is what they said they were going to do years ago . if a chunk of it gets sold , there will not be much of that spectrum left for the public to use . what is exciting about it , is the entry cost to set it up is far lower than running fiber . google and microsoft are currently setting up networks in other countries and testing them out .	0

while we use the term ' create ' for what artists / engineers / programmers do , we have to keep in mind what that does and does not mean in this context . pro - ip arguments often ascribe to artists / engineers / programmers some sort of mystical godlike ability to bring entirely new things into the world . but what they ' create ' are actually finite segments of information , i . e . numbers . the entire harry potter series as a compressed <allcaps> rar </allcaps> of pdfs , or the entirety of halo 4 as a giant windows installer file , is some large binary number . it ' s not like that number could not be found , or would somehow behave differently , if the particular artist who came up with it did not exist . the artist merely discovers <emphasis> what numbers have good practical or aesthetic properties . to say that discovering a number with good practical or aesthetic properties means the artist has the moral right to stop everybody else in the universe from making copies of that number ( at least for a certain period of time ) is absurd .	0

the google car will not leave the road and will avoid crossing the centerline in all but the most extreme cases . the google car does not see the difference between a car full of baby nuns and kittens ( or whatever your fear mongering wants to use ) and a garbage truck so it may very well hit one or the other . what it will do however is drive in a manner that potentially avoids the accident in the first place and react to potential threats faster than a human can realize whats even happening . all of the examples you listed are things humans could fail to judge ( and have , all the fucking time ) just the same as a driverless . i have fucking seen an accident where a person has hit someone in the opposite lane try to avoid a goddamn football . humans have to make all the same split second reactions as the car just with less speed and information . so go ahead and ponder how a real person would weigh all the moral decisions and outcomes in the tenths of a second before they are forced to act . fucking hilarious .	0

i agree with your statements here , as i believe they are factually correct . normal torrenting is a fair bit more dangerous than through sites like popcorn time , however that does not remove the danger of using p2p networks for content delivery without first filtering the contributors to that p2p network . it ' s not a situation similar to my grandma downloading an executable version of gone with the wind and infecting her computer , but it is not a practice i would personally use on any of my computers that i want to keep protected and virus free . it ' s a huge hole in a computer ' s security without any doubt what so ever . my initial point regarding torrents being inherently insecure stands .	0

so a centralized server is hosting the data / application logic because consistency across a networked database is decidedly a hard problem and <allcaps> ipfs </allcaps> hosts are storing static content only and polling the centralized server for everything else . might as well just use a caching service like akamai ; at least then you know that you can purge it and everyone will get the latest copy .	0

yeah , but these kind of costs can be really hard to cover for a police department or sheriff ' s office of a location with minimal tax revenue . i would not mind seeing federally sponsored programs to cover the costs for the departments that cannot afford this . then there will literally be no legitimate excuse to not have the body cams .	0

dropbox does not give you 1 5 gb free , it ' s only 2 gb . there are referrals and specials you can do from time to time to get more space , but some of them are temporary . i think the biggest i ever did to get more space was when they introduced auto photo uploading and they would raise your limit to however many photos you uploaded ( up to 5 gb extra ? ) or something and i uploaded enough to raise my quota to 7 . 8 gb with some other referrals . i have no idea how you ' d get 1 5 gb though !	0
this is obviously the government ' s fault .	1
the free market will fix everything	1
which is hilarious , because they just recently stated that only 20% of the users go over like 40 gb ( maybe it was even 100 gb ) or something like that . so why should they have to worry about those ultra - high 300 gb caps then ?	1

suddenlink already does this in my home town , but they dont offer the option to pay more without the cap . if you go over 300 or 3 5 0 gb per month depending on package , you have to pay overage fees , which sucks because they also lie about how much data you use .	0

microsoft is a new company and have young , naive leaders trying to make the company viable . they probably had no idea a few users would use so much of the unlimited free storage which would cause them to cut back the storage amounts . i mean , now to get a decent storage amount you have to pay something . and it ' s so inconvenient to remove all those files from storage . of course , you may lose them if you try to store on a usb or cd or otherwise ( very frightening ) . sure this was a marketing campaign originally to get people to switch to onedrive . i am positive that ms did not have this up their sleeve originally , especially since they really do not know that much about marketing products .	1

right . they charge for a product they produce from raw materials . the transport cost of 1 kilowatt is not much more significant than any other . your costs are coming from the increased amount of oil / coal / gas / uranium it takes to provide your usage . comcast is not in most cases creating the data you are consuming . and do not forget , power companies are very regulated in what they can charge , both for production of electricity and in transport . anyways , it is clear that this argument is pointless , because you appear to be determined to miss the point .	0

there ' s a reason for this . streaming video takes up a lot of bandwith . as a mobile carrier , they have a finite amount of spectrum they can use , and cannot simply build out infrastructure like most wired isps to increase capacity . the only way to do that is to build additional tower sites , which is extremely <emphasis> expensive . so they need to manage the bandwith they have . if they did not , binge - on would result in about 15 - 20 or so people being able to stream video smoothly , and everyone else connected to the tower getting absolutely nothing .	0

well the thing is it does not matter what ' s good for those people . it ' s cheaper for the people who run the businesses . it ' s a prisoners dilemma . if every business said no to automation that ' d work . but if just one does it , their prices will plummet and they will run businesses trying to maintain the status quo out of business . they are saying it ' s set in stone because that ' s how the incentives of our system are set up . businesses maximize profits , and in a competitive market that includes minimizing cost . automation is coming , unless you want to eliminate free enterprise altogether , and we have to figure out how to deal with it .	0
considering how big this industry could get , $500m is a good price for getting into it !	0

" my hometown library ( denver , colorado ) has been lending e - books for a few years now , and the process is incredibly simple . you can browse the collection by any number of categories ( author , title , genre , keyword , etc . ) and download directly onto your e - reader , tablet or pc . you can also read them in your browser . our library uses overdrive software to facilitate all this . books are generally available in both adobe and kindle versions . you can keep them for a maximum of 21 days , at which point they automatically " " disappear " " from your account , or you can return them early as soon as you are finished reading them . if a book you want is already checked out to someone else , you can reserve it and you are automatically notified via email when it ' s available . you can even see how many people are ahead of you on the " " hold " " list ! it ' s a terrific system and a very easy - to - use website . of course , it ' s only available to holders of denver public library cards , for which you need to be a resident .

in order for a gas engine to produce enough electricity to power an electric motor , it would necessarily have to be at least as powerful as the electric motor itself , plus power to make up for the conversion losses . since most of time when a car is on the road it ' s not using its full power though , you could get away with using a smaller gas engine and charge the battery as long as the gas engine produces more power than the car is using on average .	0

according to the article , the sole source of this allegation is the tractor trailer driver ( the driver of the vehicle that killed the tesla driver ) . he certainly has no reason to make things up , does he ?	1
this is ultimately going to halt driver - less cars before they become the standard . you are not going to convince people to get into a machine that may or may not kill them if they do not pay attention at all times . traffic ( or people ' s behaviour on the road ) is just too random for that , and people want guarantees . nobody is going to buy into the concept if they are only automatic 99% of the time , because if you imagine how bad people are at paying attention while they are driving themselves you can imagine how terrible it will go down if they need to watch out for that 1% of the time that the machine fails to pay attention for them .	0

" where did you get the " " unattended " " from ? he failed to react to a tractor trailer and so did the autopilot , that does not mean he wasn ' t paying attention . it was an accident and totally the fault of the tractor . "	0
the tech will improve . i would love to see the current autopilot features combined with overhead satellite capabilities that will send surrounding road conditions data to the car so it is not relying on the cameras alone . that way it can pick up what is happening in parts of intersections the cameras can not see yet and what is happening two or three cars ahead .	0
yea man , you are so right . this is <allcaps> the worst thing to ever come out of corporate america </allcaps> ! let us ban a system that has proven to be safer than most drivers on the road . you are so right it ' s crazy !	1

well , because there is nothing that i know about in the net neutrality that states you cannot throttle data . it only says the data has to be treated the same . so all video is being treated the same , all audio is being treated the same . they are throttled , but all of them are throttled . the entire purpose was to get around fast lane packages and large companies being able to have fast speeds while startups could not compete . that is not occurring here , all services of the types are treated the same , and is therefore adhering to net neutrality . i know a lot of people try to say all data is the same , but no where in the title ii could i find the definition or distinction of data or the types of data , nor did i find anywhere that said it could not be throttled . tmobiles original bingeon * <allcaps> was </allcaps> * a direct violation of net neutrality because only the guys that were able to get on the bingeon allowed list got unlimited , and while they said there was not cost of entry , there were lots of sites that could not get added , including my own home services , meaning that startups very much were not on that list . the new service though corrected that . that is <emphasis> my opinion as no ruling on this has been made , but i honestly think , while stupid that caps and throttling is allowed , it is allowed by what the current title ii states .	0
foreign hackers may havepenetrated state election systems but there is no reason to believe they would use that access to tamper with results of the primaries . trump and clinton are the legitimate winners of the <allcaps> gop </allcaps> and <allcaps> dnc </allcaps> party elections . besides those are private parties , it ' s not even illegal for them to just pick who they want as a candidate . someone hacking the primaries is about the same level of crime as someone hacking red box to get free dvds , serious yes but not that <elongated> important . if the <allcaps> dnc </allcaps> and <allcaps> gop </allcaps> think the hacks significantly altered results then they can simply pick a new candidate to reflect what they believe the real outcome should have been . obviously they have not switched horses so they must believe that any hacking was insufficient to change results . again clinton and trump would not have the backing of the <allcaps> dnc </allcaps> and <allcaps> gop </allcaps> if there were <allcaps> any </allcaps> question about the legitimacy of the primary elections . we can trust the party leaders to make these sorts of decisions . heck , since they have not even raised alarm about this we probably do not even need an audit .	1

the best tool for this is [ tor browser ] ( <url> i would not mess around with a whole stack of extensions when there ' s already an excellent , integrated tool for this . you can set the security slider and privacy options to whatever level you are comfortable with . but do not put any add - ons into tor browser , as that will make you more identifiable .	0

i am not sure about smaller streamers , but i know bigger streamers do not even think running ads is worth it , even without taking adblock into account . i forget the numbers he gave but reynad has stated that he does not run ads because he thinks the minor amount of money makes from them is not worth the risk of viewers being put off by them .	0

i am an android fan , but dude , you have a convoluted viewpoint . apple removed the headphone jack , it is an idiotic move but it pales in comparison to your phone catching on fire while you use it .	0

because the removal of the headphone jack is what apple intended . noone intended for note 7 ' s to explode .	0
not everyone pays attention to the news . it ' s very plausible they were unaware of the recall .	0

yes , early on the general rule for designers was that a webpage should not require more than 1 0 0 k in total for all the resources used by it . anything more than that and there would be very noticeable lag which would annoy viewers . as the internet has evolved and access speeds have increased , now no one gives a flying fuck and as a result web pages consume huge amount of memory by comparison . plus of course now the adverts all originate somewhere else so there is no way for a developer writing the code for a page to know if the ads displayed there will be some dynamic video or just a plain image .	0
that does not sound like something apple would do at all .	1

so what ' s the problem ? your initial complaint was that your headphones do not reconnect to your phone when you cycle the bluetooth while on a plane . then you said it was speakers . now you are talking about 5 hour battery life ? i am not sure what you are getting at now . that your iphone or your bluetooth headphones will not last 5 hrs ?	0

for me , mario on the ios platform was the biggest news . ios is the leading gaming platform by a number of metrics that matter , and mario is without doubt the gold standard for computer games . its clear now that nintendo are going to depend less on their hardware business and leverage their intellectual property to make money on other platforms . i expect we will see mario on android soon as well , bit for apple to snatch this deal that signals a change on direction for nintendo is big ass news .	0

i doubt you are the only one either , but there ' s 7 + billion people on the planet and majority of the ones that use headphones probably are not using bluetooth . i think it ' s inconvenient having to charge a pair of headphones with the amount of music i listen to , especially when it ' s 2016 and battery technology as a whole is still terrible .	0

yeah but i just read an article a couple weeks ago that tesla made more in 1 quarter than the oil industry did . so do they need subsidies ?	1
so . <repeated> people are struggling to make ends meet and have to resort to staying home for entertainment instead of going to the museums , zoo ' s , cinemas , etc . obviously the logical thing to do is tax them for staying in .	1
i do not see how this can backfire in any possible way .	1
what could possibly go wrong ? because of course everyone i am sure will follow procedure at all times and to the letter , like that person who ' s just been through a bad divorce and would not at all be tempted to add a little dirt to their ex ' s file and pass it on	1
well this is why we let you cede	1
that ' s a good one . ar - 15 against the national guard and shit . wonder who ' d win .	1
if people we allowed to vote for the president of the united states , it would hinder the process .	1

oh good , if there is anything that is holding american society back , it is most definitely <allcaps> scientific research </allcaps>	1
yes , if only scientists could be as virtuous and far - sighted as bankers .	1
because the anonymous telemetry data about viruses and windows vulnerabilities that you can almost completely turn off if you want is a violation of your privacy !	1
right , because the reason its hard to enter the <allcaps> isp </allcaps> market is because there is too much federal regulation , not because building infrastructure across a large geographic area is expensive , time consuming , and runs into more state and local legal barriers than federal .	1

you smug liberal this is why trump won !	1
just buy more money ! <repeated>	1
personally ? i am shocked . i did <allcaps> not </allcaps> see that coming .	1
when will people learn that he just meant lobbyists on the left ? trump himself lobbied constantly and donated tons of money even to hillary and bill back in the day . he has no problems with lobbying as long it benefits him somehow . he does not want them damn liberal hippies getting money to further their agenda because it ' s sinful and as we all know , he ' s a really strong christian .	1
the internet is for those liberal elite assholes . make them pay double !	1
this seems credible .	1
if the isps had been forced to block the sites , he would not have had to rely on his own self - control . obviously , the child pornography was the fault of the government not stopping him , not his own fault .	1
it sure did in america !	1
yup , this will totally work because software can tell the difference between glistering breasts <emphasis> , breasts <emphasis> cancer and chicken breasts <emphasis> sandwich when you blocked any sites that have the word breasts <emphasis> .	1
i will just use incognito and watch my porn . they will never be able to catch me	1

are you saying obama ' s death panels are not real ? next you are going to tell me that obama is not a secret muslim out to destroy america !	1
so 1 of 4 prefer to see ads ?	1
yea , i hate those people who negatively stereotypes a large group of people . everyone on the donald is like that .	1
yeah . <repeated> and the hypeloop is real and is going to work .	1

oh that ' s all ? well , that ' s not racist at all !	1
this is ruining america	1
wait why are we not supposed to be happy ? twitter is censoring the enemy !	1

china next demands back pay royalties on all the wars fought with gunpowder or the tea drunk or opium and heroine consumed	1
so is that a yes or no ?	1
well all trump has to do is cut minimum wage and let us go back to the good old industrial revolution days	1
reported .	1
yeah , because the only media that led the general population to believe clinton would win in a landslide was facebook .	1
true . they are not qualified and nobody can see it	1
nice ! condescension always changes people ' s opinions !	1
yes , california , and the bay area in particular , has such a lack of universities . it ' s astonishing .	1

well , * somebody ' s* gotta think of the shareholders !	1
thats a well thought out and very presidential way of looking at the situation	1
which is great for leading a democracy which relies on compromising between two sides .	1
clearly those computers were dressed too provocatively and should have avoided that part of the internet .	1
because this would be the first time that the security of a piece of technology was cracked and sensitive data was stolen from hundreds of millions of people .	1
missiles , you point them , press a button and they go boom , what else there is to know .	1
do not blame people for killing people , blame guns for killing people !	1
what if this is another instance of 4 ^ 1 5 d chess and trump is trying to warn us ?	1

there ' s no potential for abuse here whatsoever .	1
do not be proud of your ignorance .	1
and humans never make any mistakes implementing those tools .	1
why do not they just fine the internet instead ?	1
after the great wall is completed . no point in giving coal miners their jobs back only to be stolen from their hands by mexicans .	1
the trump effect . tm	1
maybe they should !	1
" it ' s called " " menu simplification " " , and ' saves resources ' . "	1
but trump said he ' d make america great again and i believe every word he says	1
because that ' s what rainforest they destroyed to make all those books ?	1
does not everyone know to do that thing be said ? i know i certainly do its very intuitive .	1
if the us did not spend all these money on nukes and military we would have all the roads covered with solar roads	1

i am sorry , but did you make mistake in your simile ? . <repeated> harri seldon is the steve jobs of psychohistory .	1

what if we ask nicely ?	1
" <allcaps> til </allcaps> " " nasty " " is a sexist adjective . "	1
that ' s not what the fanboys say and the fanboys are always right .	1
maybe small businesses should have had shareholders to lobby for	1
shh . corporate lobbyists know whats best for you . <repeated> obama was king regulator who was pissing on consumers . let the lobbyists do their thing because the government sucks and the crony capitalist system is running full stream now . republicans just want to create jobs and give choice . <repeated>	1
i do not believe anyone could have predicted that .	1
do not break the circlejerk . trump was a bad choice . therefore hillary <allcaps> must </allcaps> have been the good choice and would not have done anything that trump is doing .	1
yeah , let us totally give the fuck up because we are spineless pieces of shit .	1
because it ' s government regulation and that has always led to bad things in the past	1
yeah turns out they do not like it when you run to home depot and buy a box of cat5e and tie it to a rock so you can sling it up around the neighborhood ' s poles and have 400 cables coming into your bedroom window plugged into a dozen linksys switches .	1
thankfully , 90,000 , 000 of us did not stay home and allow republicans to gain majority control in <allcaps> all </allcaps> branches of government .	1
do not give them ideas , they pay eighty monkeys to think of this crap !	1
when do our democrat saviors step in ?	1
that ' s how you weed out the muslims	1
make it capable of nothing but tweeting ?	1
i really do not see how such a law can easily be co - opted by a political party that wants to silence dissent around a certain crisis going on in europe	1
the mainstream media , obviously . with their stellar track record you should accept no substitutes .	1
yea , i can not see any possible way this could backfire at all	1
same like the global warming , this is some hoax made up by the poor scheming american society of civil engineers trying to scam the tax payers ' money .	1
we elected trump , he ' s the best . he said so himself .	1
replace as many human jobs as possible with robots . can not see any flaw in that <emphasis> idea .	1

time to switch to hotmail !	1
the solution is stupid . i would have shown the remaining time as twice as long but just run the clock faster ( i . e . an hour finishes in 30 minutes ) . everyone will be happy - - users get longer battery life and they could finish their work day in . <repeated> half of the time . wow	1
that just makes them smart .	1
by tying everything to the google cloud . because a single point of failure is so much safer than a bunch of little ones .	1
they will be the thinnest servers you have ever seen ! available in rose gold , gold , silver , black , jet black	1
1 mm makes all the difference if it fits in my backpack or not .	1

i think we are onto something here guys !	1
yeah , he should just sit back and continue letting congress piss away our money .	1
you elaborated and gave such a wonderfully insightful review of the surface that i simply can not understand why i just downvoted you .	1

but you can send an emoji from the keyboard !	1

people in the article comments talking about edge . edge is the tool you use to download an actual browser .	1
people ignore the overall product when some core features are missing or suck ? shocking .	1
yeah there ' s no hyperbole in that statement	1
that metaphor does not represent the situation . it ' s more like the car is unlocked in a locked garaged : it does not take a lot of skill to break in , but it definitely requires malice and a team with the knowhow . but no worries about robbing the house , nothing there was touched * , we only went after the stuff in the unlocked car ( by golly , what an idiot ! ) which exposed person x . see , i dun good !	1

hopefully we can save these jobs by buliding a wall . maybe if we defund nasa , we can pay the employees that will not exist because it ' s all automated	1

someone ' s got to be above the law , or there ' s no purpose of having laws in the first place	1

i am sure it will totally make the porn business safer for women all around as well	1
fantastic .	1
i disagree . this is not about porn at all . they are flexing their arms to see what they can do without being called out . no one would publicly go on facebook with their own identity to defend porn . those who would are often looked down upon and not taken seriously because obviously they are just rabid horndogs	1

nope , it ' s all bush ' s fault . thanks !	1

dude this is breaking news	1
and everyone knows once <allcaps> usb </allcaps> - c is the standard they will just immediately throw every other <allcaps> usb </allcaps> cable and device they own in the garbage , definitely no benefit in a laptop having both <allcaps> usb </allcaps> - c and <allcaps> usb </allcaps> - a or anything , just like people have no use for a headphone jack now a days	1
well obviously it after the os constantly checking how much battery was left that caused the drain .	1
brietbart , clearly .	1
this is a political stunt to help clinton !	1

yes , better pay 10 million now and be safe . everybody knows that <allcaps> nobody </allcaps> gets away with underpaying / not paying any wages to college students . buying a 10 million dollar logo saved them billions in the long run	1

but america does not deserve to know the shady and probably illegal stuff the <allcaps> dnc </allcaps> and hillary ' s campaign did !	1
yes , because the only reason to have a nicely designed and aesthetically pleasing phone is to show other people . there ' s no way i would want that for personal satisfaction .	1
if they needed more room for the battery they should of just removed the headphone jack .	1
yes apple , please give us pentile displays	1

jesus , what a thick laptop . how did they expect that to amaze anyone ?	1
yes because the wall street journal is so credible	1
if you wanted to bundle up those commercial loans into products and resell them you probably really do not want a human to look too closely at what is in them do you ? this is brilliant !	1
when have they done that before ?	1
the sun will eventually explode , and then what will we do ?	1
that might because they never seemed to have any lanes open in the first place .	1
it ' s almost like government subsidies help industries succeed that show promise for the future , but need to compete in the present market .	1
all the more reason that the big government needs to get behind the coal industry , so much more room for growth and advancement !	1
you mean the same way that users were able to easily opt out of installing win 10 ?	1
okay , which one is it ?	1
yeah , it would suck for consumers to actually gain more rights for a change	1
they have fox and breitbart though the only not - fake news sources .	1
cos that has always worked out so well !	1
that is a great way to convince people to agree with you . call them names .	1

" " " i firmly believe that these isps should spend their limited capital building out better broadband to rural america " " - i guess i missed how this affects utility poles regulations . my bad . "	1

but that ' s welfare ! better to just let em starve .	1
i do not know , man , they cited some pretty quality sources like the examiner and drudge for this totally objective piece of journalism .	1

i can not wait for nn to be ablolished , so that you will need to pay 10 extra dollars to access reddit .	1
we should let the market decide . and by market i mean let big telecom companies legislate their way to regional monopolies and keep out competitors through unfair business practices .	1
fuck them , if he sees a reddit thread he can comment whatever he wants without reading the article .	1
its not like hackers can just steal and release that private information or anything	1

america needs to give up with this sort of technology and leave it to the chinese freeing up america to burn more coal	1
no worries , redditors from uk will know about it . the protests will be tremendous .	1
you mean the job creators	1
what ? you do not appreciate the entertainment of exploding batteries ?	1
that ' s all nice and dandy but guys we got to focus in raw real issues , dem polish immigrants stealing our jobs and sharia laws being implemented everywhere ! do not mind the cameras , the enforced police , the government spying on you . <repeated> remember it ' s all necessary to stop the muslims	1
do not be ridiculous . we have to tackle the welfare problem and illegal immigrants . <repeated> they are the real vultures here .	1
global warming is the biggest threat to our world . because it interferes with good business . so this guy is pretty much a terrorist .	1
that makes sense . there must be balance in both aspects .	1
i mean hitler had good intentions , because actions do not matter as long as the intentions are good , right ?	1
right so its not the drivers fault for being wasted and ( probably ) driving too fast anyway , its not the oncoming traffics fault for being in the wrong lane , its not the person who let her drive the cars fault its definatley teslas fault for making a fast car . not like sporty cars are supposed to be fast amiright ?	1
nope , no way , not ever . you dare to question your benevolent corporate overlords ?	1
well you know , it ' s not his or his daughter ' s fault that the government forced her to purchase and drive a tesla . tesla needs to design their cars so idiots do not kill themselves driving drunk .	1
we are the worst , and should be ashamed that we were born .	1
how else do you get promotions ?	1
it is not murder if it ' s collateral damage	1
. <repeated> except if it ' s a gun . then you should be able to sue the manufacturer !	1
please , you are making it sound like they are supposed to protect and serve	1
we should make alcohol illegal , clearly people have no self control .	1
nope , intoxication has nothing to do with it , car is too fast for drunk drivers to drive drunk	1
yes , lets reduce a situation we are not privy to and some potentially negligent behavior into a rhyme so that we can more easily denigrate others .	1
at which point he will sue the legal system for having been permitted to bring such an outrageous lawsuit in the first place . who needs a legal system where you can sue for anything ? ! <repeated>	1

yup if i crash my <allcaps> wrx </allcaps> it ' s definitely the turbo ' s fault	1
you must live in california	1
because gas powered cars could not possibly catch fire , right ?	1
yeah man maybe we should have some kind of nanny state telling us what we can and can not do and what we should and should not be able to buy in the name of protecting us .	1
especially brown ones abroad . i mean , are they even people <emphasis> ? i mean , really ?	1
the trick ? put the sensitive info in the kids graduation slide presentation . ain ' t nobody got time for that .	1

big list of tech companies there .	1
software as a product , software as a service , software as a contraceptive . just download an app and you will not get pregnant . 100% effective .	1
i am sure it ' s just evangelical propaganda to get birth control banned .	1
thank god there are no democrats who love the wealthy or big corporations ! just imagine what it would be like if hollywood were democrats !	1
just take everything you see and hear at face value . <repeated> whats the worst that could happen ?	1
since people are too stupid to spot fake news and it ' s really bad for them , apple and the like should protect us by making sure we are never allowed to see it .	1
you are fun at parties .	1
yeah fuck those guys who voted for bernie sanders , that no good independent . they just keep reelecting him too .	1
yea does not bode well for their crebidility	1
we should let the market decide . and by market i mean let big telecom companies legislate their way to regional monopolies and keep out competitors through unfair business practices .	1
that ' s un - american . they should be building miniature coal fired power plants .	1
do not be silly . people will just switch to one of their many other internet providers if a company did that .	1
look what facebook did to egypt . the internet must be contained , controlled , and have full domination by the <allcaps> usa </allcaps> . we can not have a government topple because of the facebook and the internet .	1
he ' s recouping it on ivanka ' s merchandise .	1
some do . because what else do you need a smartphone for ?	1
because history has shown that nothing works as well as when the government bans something	1
why do we need solar when we have <allcaps> clean </allcaps> coal ?	1
obviously the risotto recipe .	1
probably because you are not distracted by coughing up coal	1
we should see if cliven bundy and his friends are available for a protest .	1
bigly fake news !	1
but trump is going to fight for coal and get those jobs back !	1
not for long ! thanks trump !	1
fake news	1
but . <repeated> but . <repeated> but . <repeated> my favorite politician has so many conflicts of interest which result in him benefiting from the production damaging sources of energy , so . <repeated>	1
yes , but does it make the rich a whole lot richer ? i think not . therefore i will support coal as fuel because the koch brothers spent a heap of money telling me i should .	1
solar jobs , or as some trump supporters might say , ' clean coal ' .	1

when they reach the point they riot and set fires to protest for their personhood .	1
no no you do not get it . i want to graduate with zero practical knowledge about jack shit ( beyond some theory i memorised at uni ) and still get the job because they should know i am so smart and will just learn when they train me .	1
but the government should not be in the business of helping and supporting people with regulations , education , and social programs . that ' s the way to communism .	1
he hates the environment .	1
they are not looking to prop up clean coal , obviously they hate oil	1
good to see technological progress being made ! <repeated> <happy>	1
naw , it just means you are too poor to pay to see the law you are accused of violating .	1
there ' s a workaround for that , if we used another lighter - than - air gas that ' s much more abundant we ' d be fine , i think hydrogen would be a decent substitute .	1
it could not happen to a better bunch of people .	1

some of us remember <allcaps> pmrc </allcaps> witchhunts , telling us she would not push for healthcare or banking reform because of who was funding her campaign and disapprove of her warmonger voting record . but go ahead , keep calling us sexists and misogynists instead of addressing our concerns . worked so well last time	1
they see it as allowing businesses to offer more products at different price points . therefore allowing more business to happen , more jobs more money for everyone involved . how could it possibly be wrong .	1
because benghazi and her emails .	1

probably about as effectively as the <allcaps> pdf </allcaps> format made books extinct in the 9 0 s . i mean , dream weaver almost killed off web design professionals , did not it ? this new thing is surely the final blow .	1
yeah , never mind the numerous other landings . it was faked .	1

you can not even see his taxes from the past decade , why would you even ask this	1
filthy white matriarchy !	1
calling your representative sure helped	1

can we stop treating criminals so badly ? criminals are human beings and deserve human rights too . how many people do you think stole something from a shop in their life ? well , guess what ? they are criminals . guess we should take away their right to privacy and right to vote for the rest of their life	1

clearly just a ' flash in the pan ' we will be back on coal any day now .	1
wikileaks is fake guys ! dont you know ? its all fake russian news from a child rapist !	1
funny how this is release as more and more news about trump ' s ties to russia is revealed . <repeated> i am sure russia had no influence on that one .	1
that must be why they removed the headphone jack and the magsafe connector , they were known attack vectors .	1
i should have added an	1

do they have to be confirmed by the senate ? if so then they probably will not be able to work until october based off on how slow the senate is currently going .	1
ooh my god no how can this be i am so shocked that this could happen never saw this coming what a shock .	1

what an insightfull and well thought out comment . you truly made a point and furthered this discussion	1
both parties are the same	1
but how are they supposed to make any money that way ?	1
you forgot this :	1
what is this face - book thing that people keep talking about ?	1
free market guys - you failed to invest in having laws written to destroy your competition , and now you are crying to the government . typical liberals .	1
wait i thought the <allcaps> gop </allcaps> was all about free markets .	1
yes , because an emmy for writing comedy is truly an excellent measure of intelligence	1

" give a company access to your emails and they used that information for profit because it was a " " free service " " . wow never would have expected that to happen . "	1
yes , uber is the only company out there that is interested in your data .	1
even after bringing back unlimited data ?	1
but trump is evil and we need to stop him no matter what , even if it means becoming the very thing we stand against . hatred , narrow mindedness , and bigotry is acceptable when applied to deplorables like trump .	1

nah , you are reading this from a computer , so it ' s technology related .	1
* * goddamn capitalists . * *	1
no dude it just makes businesses against the people because they are greedy	1
but we do not need any competition in the public sector . a public sector union controlling the entire workforce of a public service has no deleterious effects on government spending or efficiency	1
yeah but 3am here is 5 p . m . over there	1

loving this technology news !	1
yeah but it is not my <emphasis> kind of free speech , you know ? free speech is ok only if it aligns with my beliefs .	1
because iphones are totally immune to all malware , amirite ?	1
have not you heard ? trump is satan incarnate . anyone that associates with him is literally hitler .	1
lol slowing it down 99.99999% is not cutting it off !	1
i guess this is just more proof people dont want faster internet	1

but . <repeated> they are are not they ? . <repeated>	1
yeah , paying money to help the services of your local government really is basically the same as paying rent .	1
probably could have launched this 1 - 8 years ago , but then it would have been reporting on nothing amiss .	1
right , like you do not need <emphasis> to use a car to get to work , your legs work just fine . start walking at 3am and you will get there on time probably .	1
oh , no , centralizing power with those that stand to profit a ton from having it is so <elongated> much better	1
sure , because if there ' s anything we have seen time and time again , it ' s that corporations can always be trusted to do the right thing when left to their own devices , so let us go ahead and de - regulate because the free market will see to it that everybody makes out ok .	1
then do not use camcast . nobody has to use the internet .	1
such an open president .	1
it ' s ok guys this is not bribery . there ' s no proven link between the money and the actions those politicians take . citizens united was a smart decision .	1
oh really ? i wouldve expected they got paid less .	1
<allcaps> but corporations are people too </allcaps> !	1
this is nothing compared to what <allcaps> vpn </allcaps> providers gave	1
why go to a track when there are thousands of miles of open road ? they are paying a lot for the thrill of driving dangerously fast ; we as a society owe them their fun .	1
that swamp sure is being drained	1

this is 1000% because of uber leaving austin	1
but texas is evil and not green and filled with texans ! <repeated>	1
what if it ' s an offer you can not refuse ?	1
only one ?	1
hey , we should put the government in control of communication !	1
this is literally the last thing i expected	1
that was the plan all along . vpn companies pay off the senate majority and get rich quick .	1
stop being so lazy and ride your horse to work already !	1
you are obviously unfamiliar with state - sponsored lead piping , rolling for - profit brownouts , and toll roads .	1
yeah , just delete the currency and let us all have breadlines	1
yeah ! replace government officials ! except mine , because mine always has my best interests at heart , but definitely replace all the other government officials !	1
what , it ' s just a square root away	1
well , that ' s lovely .	1
good argument	1
they always <emphasis> have our best interests in mind .	1
yeah but that will not line anyone ' s pockets , and would only lead to more people being satisfied and happy .	1
yeh but they said they would limit the government , so , they can not lie about that stuff right ?	1
and all this requires is for both the us and mexico to cede some of their territory to this new quasi - state , and to relinquish their control over it . <repeated> yeah , this reactionary congress will love this idea !	1
it ' s lovely this time of year .	1
man that one random engineer on youtube really showed up the hundred people working on this tech ! game over , everybody go home .	1
republicans will never support building a wall that actually accomplishes something .	1
that ' s because obummer was ruining everything so much they did not even want to be here !	1
can we just start cleansing the country and build the wall with the dead bodies of all the undesirables ? is not that really why we voted for him ?	1
