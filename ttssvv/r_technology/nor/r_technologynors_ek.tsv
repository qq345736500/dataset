foreign hacker may havepenetrated state election system but there be no reason to believe they would use that access to tamper with result of the primary . trump and clinton be the legitimate winner of the gop and dnc party election . besides those be private party , it ' s not even illegal for them to just pick who they want as a candidate . someone hack the primary be about the same level of crime as someone hacking red box to get free dvd , serious yes but not that important . if the dnc and gop think the hack significantly alter result then they can simply pick a new candidate to reflect what they believe the real outcome should have be . obviously they have not switch horse so they must believe that any hacking be insufficient to change result . again clinton and trump would not have the backing of the dnc and gop if there be any question about the legitimacy of the primary election . we can trust the party leader to make these sort of decision . heck , since they have not even raise alarm about this we probably do not even need an audit .	1

there be lot of different vpn server and client , some of them implement in software and some in hardware ( dedicated appliance , firewall , etc ) . but yes , if a server becomes saturate , then it will result in high latency and eventually packet loss just like any other server . vpn server can be configure in such a way as to be highly available , so if one ( or more ) fail , others can pick up new session , though existing session will break and have to re - authenticate . many enterprise load balancer can also balance connection to a pool of vpn server and keep session on the same backend server where they start via priority group , so you be not as likely to run into the issue of saturation because each new session go to a different ( typically least - load ) backend server .	0
