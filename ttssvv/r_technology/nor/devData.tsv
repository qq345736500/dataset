there be lot of different vpn server and client , some of them implement in software and some in hardware ( dedicated appliance , firewall , etc ) . but yes , if a server becomes saturate , then it will result in high latency and eventually packet loss just like any other server . vpn server can be configure in such a way as to be highly available , so if one ( or more ) fail , others can pick up new session , though existing session will break and have to re - authenticate . many enterprise load balancer can also balance connection to a pool of vpn server and keep session on the same backend server where they start via priority group , so you be not as likely to run into the issue of saturation because each new session go to a different ( typically least - load ) backend server .	0
