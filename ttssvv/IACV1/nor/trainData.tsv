well , in the case above , it be step - by - step . first , an exist enzyme be modify to a new use , and over time , become refine to work well and good . this be the way evolution work . nothing be de novo ; it ' s always a modfication of something else . second , a mutation produce a regulator that only allow the enzyme to be produce if the substrate be available . again , this be refine by natural selection over time . in the end , the newly - evolved system be irreducibly complex , because all three part have to be present for the system to work . and do show us your number prove that such process can not produce new information . if you do not know how , i ' d be please to show you how a mutation change the information in a population .	0

hey thanks for the `` edit / out of context sermon . `` peter be rebuke for interfere with the plan of god . oh . . . christ never say to throw the sword away . . . `` put it away `` mean put it away in the sheath . mark 8 : 31 and he begin to teach them that it be necessary for the son of man to suffer many thing and to be reject of the elder and chief priest and scribe , and to be kill , and after three day to rise again . 32 and he speak the word openly . and take him aside , peter begin to rebuke him . 33 but turn around and see his disciple , he rebuke peter , say , go behind me , satan , because you do not mind the thing of god , but the thing of men . 34 and call near the crowd with his disciple , he say to them , whoever desire to come after me , let him deny himself and take his cross , and let him follow me . 35 for whoever desire to save his life , he shall lose it . but whoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel , that one shall save it . 36 for what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world , yet damage his soul ? 37 or what shall a man give as an exchange for his soul ? 38 for whoever may be ashamed of me and my word in this adulterous and sinful generation , the son of man will also be ashamed of him when he come in the glory of his father , along with the holy angel . matt 26 : 47 and as he be yet speak , behold , juda come , one of the twelve . and with him be a numerous crowd with sword and club , from the chief priest and elder of the people . 48 and the one betraying him give them a sign , say , whomever i may kiss , it be he ; seize him . 49 and come up at once to jesus , he say , hail , rabbi . and he ardently kiss him . 50 but jesus say to him , friend , why be you here ? then come up , they lay hand on jesus and seize him . 51 and , behold , one of those with jesus , stretch out the hand , draw his sword and strike the slave of the high priest and take off his ear . 52 then jesus say to him , put your sword back into its place . for all who take the sword shall perish by a sword . 53 or do you think that i be not able now to call on my father , and he will place beside me more than twelve legion of angel ? 54 how then should the scripture be fulfil , that it must happen this way ?	1
and you have be refute time after time . lie , damn lie and statistic be a starting point . its the false idea of the more powerless you render yourself the safer you will be . i bet you strongly believe its possible to pick up a turd by the clean end .	1

they be both write in the bible . neither of them have any evidence ( apart from the bible ) to support their existence . one of them have be prove to be utterly false . this naturally discredit the other , as they appear in the same publication by the same author . why decide one be true when the other be clearly not , and neither have any other support evidence ?	0
how do you define `` convenience `` ?	0
nope . not part of evolutionary theory . it would be stupid to claim that increased genetic variability would `` disallow `` any portion of the population from breed .	0

but . but . i just swallow 56 zygote so that they could vote by proxy through me for the ripofflican ( tm ) party this upcoming election so they can win . now i be go to have all that indigestion for nothin ' . as to drive . do not care . what i will miss most be all of those credit card offer that come in their name . there ' s just so much that they , live though me want to ' buy now and pay late ' on . you say they can not do that ? but , that ' s just the argument chem99a and i be have in another thread . and this be what it devolve down into . parasite attach to a human and one that ' s coax it ( often with governmental support ) to nurish it . not much difference . personally , i ' d rather have the sucker permanently attach to me so i be not force to think about feed it or change it ' s diaper . i ' d also take a kick to the rib over cholic cry . silly neglegence law . yep . i do think some would be willing to work towards compromise that would make the most happy . jitobear seem to be one from my observation . but , others want it their way . i dislike abortion but can see in some circumstance that there really be not much of an alternative . i also see that most anti - abortionist often do not help to provide alternative . i do not want to make it illegal per se but do want to work towards reduce the instrances in which a woman would see it as a more viable alternative . it ' d be nice if society and science would progress to that point . but , since it be not and since i be evil ( tm ) , kill it . go ahead . be a murderer . muahahahaha . evil win ! go evil , go evil , go evil . um , be not evil subjective ?	1
that `` somebody `` be a jesuit priest , the idea meet some initial resistance because of it ' s religious overtone . but the overwhelming evidence in favor of it carry the day . you should study some history too .	1

first , i think you may have misunderstood the `` pro - life mantra `` see how many pro - lifer think it permissable to disconnect life - support system in certain circumstance , which necessarily result in a person ' s death . but nevertheless , i think we agree that for purpose of the abortion discussion , it be a close analogy to assume the violinst be only connect for nine month , and no long than if we assume the violinist to be connect for some other arbitrary period of time . be i correctly discern an agreement on that ?	0
so be jesus , aka god , a liar ? or be not even one of the million of believer who pray for terri schiavo ' s life to be save really god ' s child ? gee , i wonder how many people out there be be lead by a pastor , priest , or what have you , that pray but god do not listen because that religious leader be a fraud ? hmm , maybe the rape or molestation of young boy , adulty , and so on , by religious leader be more widespread than anyone could have imagine ? ! 	1
so what you be say be that by mention both in the same post , i be say that unless someone be a yec then they be not a christian ? because that be what you attribute to me . yet you have yet to post evidence of me say that to anyone . nor have you support your original claim here , you say this : last i check , no credible fossil fuel firm hire yec geologist . prove this assertion since you research it thoroughly enough to start a thread about .	1
that be amazing . i find it crazy that this baby be much young and small and far less developed than many of the baby that be abort . abortion be murder .	0
there ya go , tither , three guy out of several hundred thousand ?	1
but it take a lot long to develop . my point be that only after about 5000 year of human civilization do empiricism as science develop . religion , supernaturalism , and mythology trace back into prehistory . what we know as science do not even begin to exist until the late 1 5 0 0 s and 1 6 0 0 s . before that it be ok to do science like aristotle do - no experiment , only think about a logical answer . thus , heavy object fell faster than light one and any fool could tell that the sun orbit the earth . but science be more than an inner way of thinking . it be a process and a method for learn about the universe . it be call methodological naturalism . that be not to say the science assert that nothing exist except what be natural . it say that science can not study the supernatural .	0
and oddly enough you have be give several on silver platter . perhaps you need to visit a neurologist and get check for memory problem ? just to remind you once more - sickle cell trait be a mutation and it benefit the phenotype under specific definable condition . do you really want to get hit about the head with that bat yet again ?	1
notice that nowhere here do you address the claim and evidence - - which the movie apparently lack - - about the assertion of `` the expelled . `` try to deflect attention from your inability to respond substantively will not fly with us ; these guy be fudge the story and share only select piece in a specific attempt to hide what really happen . for what it ' s worth , i feel a hell of a lot more vulnerable as an atheist in my profession and location than iders should feel in research and teach academia .	0
i be now slightly less confused about why i have never see this discuss before .	1
the simple fact be that people do not want the immense responsibility that logically pertain to their voluntary action action , so they fabricate denial of reality as a convenient escape , out of pure selfishness - - like every other atrocity in history . the study of law include an analysis of how people excuse their wrongdoing , fabricate pausible rationalization for their acting to benefit at another ' s expense ; denial be typically the first of these , claim that the act `` do not hurt anyone , `` however obvious the contrary . other rationale follow , such as self - preservation , natural right to act , and eventually grow defensive by blame the victim . while the fabricator typically believe his story original , it be anything but - - it ' s simply the inevitable course of selfishness .	0
actually electro , do you remember this thread ? evidence for a flood ? oddly enough it take 20 page before one of them even try to argue against the reason why the flood do not occur .	0

this be pretty much my understanding of how natural selection be view before darwin . nonetheless , i think that my point still stand . darwin propose that natural selection be responsible for the diversification of specie . this pre - darwin concept deny this . my understanding be that anti - evolutionist refuse to accept that natural selection could have lead to the diversification of specie . until recently , when they realize that evolutionary theory could help out in their how - many - animal - could - fit - on - the - ark dilemma ; now they suddenly take an idea from evolutionary science and propose that suddenly all the present specie could `` micro - evolve `` from a few ancestral `` kind `` on the ark .	0
there be no god that support the forcing of woman to suffer and carry out unplanned pregnancy , just because some pl advocate spit it our . `` sorry , be go to force you to give birth , those men over there have decide `` . thats as ridiculous as say `` there be no god to condone the slaughter of thousand of innocent life form inside of the cut `` ( refer to disinfect a cut ) . pro - lifer have be drop on their head too many time .	1
upon review the golden rule `` do unto others as you would have them do unto you `` i see nothing of any other ' side . ' it ' s very clear - - treat others the way you ' d want to be treat . no one want to be treat badly , so if you follow the golden rule , you will be benevolent .	0

[ quote = zsu2357 ; 361463 ] [ quote = penfold ; 361428 ] wrong . it be a precision machine design to kill effectively . it can be operate by other than human mean . yes , you would be wrong . no , they do not . true , but nobody suggest there be such a grey area . we accept your word . i have never see this , do you have example ? so far as i be aware , nobody but you believe this to be the case .

well he have far political aspiration . the 9 th circuit in sodom ( sf ) be always make law instead of interpret it . that be why they be over rule so often . 	0
interest thought . such a situation would theorectically remove the division of opinion that exist base upon the perspective of gender ( ie . the pro - life religious male ) and would make any difference of opinion be base on moral / philosophical consideration alone . you could argue it would shift opinion towards the mix currently hold by woman as everyone would be in the position of have to bear pregnancy . give that there be a full mix of religious and other belief in the current day female population perhaps this would be a good analogy to such a state of be you suggest .	0
hey , thanks for the quote ! be i publish now ?	1
you be look at evolution in way too much of a magical and mystical way . evolution do not `` know `` anything . it do not have any desire . and . i lack the eloquence to briefly state mechanical ( and complete lack of desire ) aspect of evolution . i suggest you do research as to how there be no conscious think element in evolution . science will never be able to disprove any god because of some flaw science happen to point out . the best individual can do be , when people try to reason that such perfect organ imply a designer , point out that the design be not all that perfect after all . if you want to try and debate flaw in design be evidence against a god . well go ahead . but then i will just know if i be ever look for an easy debate victory i will just try to find you . at the very best all you be do be show that the idea that god create all thing perfectly probably be not true . and even then someone can just point out that apparent flaw we see be simply the ineffable will of god .	0
who say anything about `` redefine `` it ? i say you would still have your `` traditional marriage `` accord to your choose religion .	1
well , i think it be best to use a real source . like the australian fbi , call the a.i.c . the late figure . violent crime from 1996 to 2007 ( per 100,000 person per year ) homicide be pretty much a flat line no ? however there violent crime be not . and to be fair , australia ' s murder rate have always be significantly low then ours and they should be congratulate for there socialization for it too . so if gun relate crime go down but the murder rate remain relatively flat , but other violent crime go up , then what be thew point of mention that gun relate crime go down ?	1
i think i ' d give brady and penfold a chance to tell us what a bad man this guy be for defend himself like that . btw , here in alaska he do not need to have a concealed carry permit . here , if you can legally own a gun you can carry it with a few exception . merry christmas	1

once can not abort a pregnancy if it have not begin . the morning after pill prevent a pregnancy from ever occur by prevent the fertilize egg from implant . if one considers pregnancy to begin at conception ( i . e . fertilization of the egg ) , then petri dish be pregnant when egg be fertilize on them ( `` conception `` ) for later ivf . do we really want to be consider petri dish pregnant ?	1

what ' s your point ? of course they will be bind by heller just as the court be bind by roe v . wade . that point wasn ' t in dispute . as long as you be talk about 1 9 th century second amendment case law , i like the state v . buzzard ( 1842 ) .	0
be that a trick question ? no , the tabloid and other gutter press keep go on about how bad it be , because they sell paper by fan fear and hatred , and fear of crime be one of their big market . yes there have be an increase in gun crime over the year , but that ' s largely attributable to increased attractiveness of crime in a society where social mobility have come to a standstill . in any case the number of incident where firearm be use in crime be still very small , which be why every time someone get shot it be headline news . gun be incredibly rare in this country , the only time i have see gun in real life ( other than air rifle ) be on a military base .	0
you know why . because they want you to stop posting . most of them want to rant , and they do not want their rant challanged . it ' s typical of the whole evolutionary community , i be afraid . obvious_child and i be explore this up in the `` number `` thread .	1
to clarify : be it the woman choice whether the guy be prosecute after he have be name , or be it the state ? by what you have say so far , it seem that all this law do be give woman the power to punish men if they get pregnant by them ; despite the fact that the woman be just as consent as the man at the time of the coitus . there be also contraceptive path for woman that do not involve condom . if a woman get pregnant because she forget to take the pill that morning and always rely on that rather than on condom to stop her get pregnant , why should the man be punish ? the message here should be simple . if you do not want an abortion , and be not currently in a position where you can support your child , do not have unprotected sex . at the moment , it be the woman ' s choice alone whether she have an abortion or not , so it be the woman who have to look after the child if she be single after its birth . if you want to add men to that equation , you have to add them in both place - give them the legal right to ' have an abortion ' ( force their partner to have one ) , and make them legally responsible for the child if they do not do so . then you have an entirely connected couple from coitus onwards ; both consent to sex , both choose not to have an abortion and both care for the child after birth . i doubt that that law would be a popular one , either - but if you be go to force a man to take equal legal responsibility for a child , you have to give them equal legal opportunity to avoid it .	0

if science deal with how information be gather , different way of analyzing , and different hypothesis , then it involve worldviews . the base for the worldview of a sizable part of the population should not be exclude . maybe in saddam hussien ' s iraq , maybe in communist russia , but not in the united state .	1

well , let us see . 1 this be a skull from a modern human , the difference represent pathological deformity . 2 the dating be base on disputed methodology . creation scientist have prove that radioisotope dating be unreliable . 3 the two piece be only assume to be from the same individual . 4 where ' s the conclusive dna evidence ? ( a nod to easyrider on the religion board . ) 5 these claim be make by scientist , and all science be an atheistic conspiracy against religion ( thank you marc9000 ) . 6 so where ' s the miss link between the new fossil and us ? huh ? huh ? sadly , past experience suggest that creationists can wriggle on indefinitely .	1
no i do not think that tie your tube be abortion . i only think abortion come into play when there be actually cell form to make a baby , and you get them scrap out , or abort a baby before or after the third trimester . plus i heard that if you tie the tube , when you decide you want a baby you can untie the tube , to conceive a baby . but burn be another thing . but unless there be actual cell form it be not abortion	0
actually , i think kronos be right in this case - - at least from the standpoint of most consitutional scholar . of course the framer do not envision the wording to be use in this way for this purpose - - this be what ' s simply call a `` loophole `` , in this case anyway . it ' s why there have be an effort in recent year to close the loophole with a constitutional amendment define marriage .	0
yes they sure will . with what 776 accidental death last year due to gun as oppose to 3,402 accidental drownings seem like more should be spend on prevent drownings than gun . but if your intellect be not up to understanding hyperbole ( literary form of exageration to express a point ) i will try in the future to keep it down to your level .	1
but i do not hear you say thing like `` baseball be always harmful to the player `` or `` baseball be something no one should have to go through . `` you see , if pro - choicers only use the ' pregnancy - be - bad - if - force argument , they might have a point , but they often do not add the last part . besides , no one ever force a woman to get pregnant in the first place .	0

intellignet design seem to have a large following . the fact that somebody believe in intellient design do not necessarily mean that they disagree with evolution . a lot of folk ( i would say the majority ) view it as evolution use as a vehicle for intellient design ( basically `` god plan it and make it all happen `` ) . the movement to teach yec be non existant . creationism do not necessarily = yec . the yec crowd be their own little clique of scientific illiterate . i have be on the local board of education for 2 year now and have never hear the phrase `` young earth creationists `` in any official capacity , nor have anybody ever suggest that it be teach . i have no idea what a `` young earth creationist `` be until i read it on this board , 6 month ago . it be simply not an issue , and i be right in the middle of kansa .	0
really ? so , university president and trustee - - the overwhelming majority of whom have no connection with evolution , and most of whom be considerably more politically conservative than university faculty - - be behind the whole thing ? wow . you know , this sort of claim require evidence . i would like see your evidence of university administration involvement . get any ? and who be the `` top `` in the peer - review process ? editor ? please explain what you mean .	1
so long as they do not contain my dna , yes .	1

oh , ok , i can be politically correct if it make you feel well . how about i refer to them as `` intelligence deficient `` . and i be really not refer to bona fide `` retard `` individual ( those with true pathology ) . i agree that there be nothing funny about that . how about i refer to them as people who drive like x . be that good ?	1
you still do not get it . how many time do it have to be explain to you ? population evolve . no change of any kind in a single organism be evolution . evolution be the change in the hereditary ( genetic ) makeup of population over time . you continue to display your ignorance . evolution be a process that take place in living thing . just because all of science contradicts your childish belief in mythology do not mean that all science be evolution . because cosmology contradicts your mythology , it must be evolution . because astronomy contradicts your mythology , it must be evolution . because geology contradicts your mythology , it must be evolution . and that be why creationists be such scary people . their morality come from a book and threat of eternal punishment . the fundamentalist christian morality be so shallow that they be unable to conceive that others can actually have a high morality base on self respect . and that be meaningless babble . evolution be a process that have be observe whether you like it or not . it be not a moral statement nor be it a statement of faith . it do not deal with government , law or culture . whine about it will not change it .	0

you twist logic strike again . i realise that if a group of you be to take your gun and rise up against the current administration , you would all be label terrorist . this be not evidence that i support the current regime . how you could twist it to seem so be beyond me . if i be to state that you could not take on a fully grown polar bear with just a short pointy stick , would that mean i be support the oppressive rule of polar bear ? i think you should sit down and carefully think out what you infer from other ' s argument before you keep come out with these ludicrous statement .	0
oh i understand plenty . what you want be a system where a person be hold responsible for crime that they do not commit . you want `` guilty by association `` extend to the point of ridiculousness where anybody who even meet the criminal even once can be hold as an accomplice .	1

gun control be not on this list of crime contribute factor . however banning gun would leave the law - abide defenseless in the face of these criminal predator . why do not you work for change these condition instead of work for something that have no effect on reduce crime ( gun control ) . however , if you think you can prove gun control will work as crime control , then go for it ! maybe you can cower us with your overwhelming evidence .	1
i see . so what you be say be that you be unsure about evolution and wish to explore it . great . then start with one of those unreasonable and dumb argument and present it . why be you more reasonable and not so dumb ? it ' s easy to do what you have do . i can claim that invisible pink unicorn push the moon across the sky . i can claim that you be unreasonable and dumb because you disagree with me . but it be meaningless unless i be willing to show that i have a pair and can step up and show why i be right . do you have a pair ?	1

well let me put it like this , i consider it your duty because if you do not protect yourself then you basically shift that responsibility to someone else . not only be this incredibly selfish , but 9 out of 10 time the ' protection business ' get outsource to the state . this in itself it dangerous because when people decide that a third party like the state ( which have no real accountability ) have control over their life it can all to easily lead to a situation where the state become tyrannical . more people have be kill by their own government than by any foreign government .	0
ditto square . if they support kill a perfectly healthy unborn child , they will argue that the reason state in the op be the main reason abortion be need and justify . and i must say that if 98 % of all abortion be perform for that reason , the public stance against them might not be so strong .	0
so you be a historian now ? yes , you be right - the civil war be fight to keep the union in tact . but , it be also a fact that abraham lincoln , the commander in chief of the union army , do not believe that the union could be preserve unless slavery be abolish . accord to who ? though it may not have be practice to its fullness , it in no way follow that all men be not create equal . someone who actually have knowledge about the civil war would certainly know that lincoln do not believe the union could be preserve unless slavery be abolish . and i do not expect you to . the reason you will not go into how all men be create equal during reconstruction be because you can not prove that all men be not create equal .	1

you mean like allow for , and funding , comprehensive sex education , birth control , and parenthood planning ? those thing alone would reduce the number of abortion significantly . however , we live in a nation that would fire a surgeon general for state that masturbation be healthy . we live in a nation that believe that sex be only of the penis - vaginal penetration variety . we live in a nation where most pregnancy be unplanned . we be so busy `` protect ' our child , that we do not realize that the best protection be information .	1

a more precise term would be `` broaden , `` since nothing about the definition pertain to the people currently cover by it would be affect , `` dilute `` or alter in any way anyone have yet demonstrate . nothing about the definition that pertain to people who already be , or can be marry change one iota . their right , benefit , and protection remain exactly the same . the only `` change `` would be to other people , people who have no connection to , nor impact on , the marriage of anyone else : the gay who will marry if the legal definition be broaden to encompass them . and the only `` change `` in that regard will be the fact that they be encompass by it , nothing more . no substantive aspect of the definition as it currently stand change in the slightest . the change be not in the definition itself . it ' s in who it apply to .	0

you be apparently unwilling to extend your think process to the other side of the argument galileo , and by this i mean , and repeat that it be not criminal own hand gun which we defender of gun right be fight for . we agree that criminal shouldn ' t be arm , and the law already exist on the book to punish them when convict criminal be catch with gun . but your solution to disarm all honest citizen in the belief that this will make them unavailable to criminal also be ludicrous to the point of self destructive insanity . it be that premise which we be fight against through the nra and other lobbying effort .	1

just on my way out , saw this , and yes ! i have long believe that this be the heart of the matter , and have try to make this point with little success from time to time . i have never see a direct response to this . ever . even in thread where the discussion have carry on in detail on both side , this concept be totally ignore . there be a similar , brief hiatus lean towards this point in one of the thread over at iidb where creationist spammer afdave be rapidly lose his dignity and prove himself predictably ignorant in all field of science include the philosophy of same . it get really interest for a bit and the guy over there look to have actually get through to him for a bit , but then he predictably go into full gish gallop mode in order to bury his own cognitive dissonance underneath wave upon wave of standard aig / evofairytale strawman . just my two penny ; this be a fascinating psychological point that should be discuss .	0
your stated stereotype of the person in the story be racist . it ' s a racist stereotype and you know it . you be so entrenched in your own world and nothing outside of it , you would not know the `` truth `` if come into your face like a lemon meringue pie . indeed the court ' s reasoning may have be as racist as your own . indeed , the article describe how the court ' s reasoning be even a surprise to the police officer ' attorney because it be so out of line with what be expect of conduct during arrest . she be not violent and she have an obvious health condition . whatever you think about what she be intend to do or not - - though she communicate quite clearly - - be rather irrelevant give the offense and those surround circumstance . i bet this be your opinion any time the story concern a black defendent and a white police officer . because you be a racist . but it be o . k . for them to repeatedly break the law like yourself speed again and again , as long as they sign the ticket . what hogwash . actually , there be , my poor addle - mind friend . indeed , you can argue that she be even exercise her responsibility as a citizen with more civic - mindedness than many because she non - violently and patiently refuse to sign the ticket . she have a right not to sign . as h.d . thoreau say to emerson in jail , when emerson say to him , `` henry why be you here ? `` - - henry answer , `` ralph , why be you not ? `` lol . well that ' s so nice of the copy who let you know . and that ' s very interesting - - `` every time `` - - archangel . how many time have you be stop ? and for go how fast ? i be sure it be a lot more than 35 mph ! and you have the nerve to talk about `` responsibility `` or how this woman be a jerk ? or to call me names ? dear , i never speed because i take my responsibility as a citizen so seriously , and i have never receive a speed ticket . be you drive under the influence as well ? how many life do you put at risk , archangel ? what pomposity ! what hypocrisy !	1

because his , as a christian , do not follow the christian bible to anywhere near the extent that mine do . `` quote mine `` - look like that will be a common acusation here . if i keep thing concise and readable , i be quote mining . that quote wasn ' t about atheist use evolutionary finding to support their concept , it be about atheist be comfortable with theistic evolution , far more than `` believer `` ( creationists ) and that do not have a thing to do with my point . again , it be irrelevent to my point . atheist believe the only source of truth be secular - it go without say . no , lewontin do not say to give people the power to discover the truth , he ' s say to give elite like him the authority to point them to `` correct `` source of truth . read note 47 for chapter 6 . miller do not misinterpret him at all . in note 47 , lewontin even mention the ny time ! because there be no aclu lawsuit when dawkin ' s book be require reading in public school . we have to more and more , as atheism be establish . it ' s a deal , if you will put a hold on lecture me about read comprension as you ignore very relevant note in the rear of the book . the one where he brag about defeat henry morris , a christian ? ( pp 172 , 173 ) sure they be , christian be always oppose christianity ! all they have to do be claim to be a christian , and there ' s no way they could be a false teacher ! and that ' s all irrelevent , because page 240 - 243 concern what happen in the world today , not what happen concern creation . his feeling about god ' s interaction with the world today would be different if he have a basic knowledge of the bible . even though the bible say god do . his understanding of the bible be very undeveloped and limited . so you be imply that when he make his snide little comment about `` preacher `` , he wasn ' t refer to priest ? i have see it all now . as i say , i hope to learn if all theistic evolution do not believe in original sin . i ' d like to know if all catholic believe the creation story be nothing but a fairy tale .	1

it be rather disrespectful but do not think it be limit to one side . most protestors on both side be not great . one thing do spark my interest , and it be say often , why be it a `` hard decision `` if you be pro - choice ? be it hard because you do not know if you want a baby around or not ? could not this decision be just as hard before be pregnant ? even so , why link it to go to an abortion clinic ? you hear `` it be hard enough to come to this decision in the first place `` but how be go through some protestors make this decision harder ? no one would admit to this but it be statement like `` it be hard enough to come to this decision in the first place `` that make me believe that someone realize it be wrong and the struggle that make it hard be whether or not to do the right thing or do they thing that would benefit you the most . and in that case , i agree . that can be a tough decision .	0

at 13 - abortion , unless she be uniquely physically advanced . it ' s incredible how many men be sure be pregnant be no big deal . steve - regard whether she can consent to abortion . technically i do not think a minor can consent to either sex or abortion in any state ( unless emancipate ) . i know that be how it be in minnesota . i be sure the law vary from state to state . medical decision generally fall to the parent . i know whether minor should have access to abortion without parental notification be a controversial issue . on the surface one would think , of course not - but there be concern for those girl who be in abusive situation at home . and as i tell vor , if i have a daughter bound and determine not to tell me , i would rather she have access to safe abortion than resort to something drastic . a baby pregnant - yikes . personally i think it ' s innapropriate and dangerous for a little girl to carry a pregnancy to term . but i would sure love to simply avoid it through good prevention . i do not think an abortion would be anything but scary for her either - but technically , at that age , it would be safe . steve - in no way , shape or form be a 13 year old ready for this - not physically , mentally or emotionally - not for pregnancy , and certainly not for parent . i have a neices that old - good gracious - no way !	0

sure . the woman be a person , and individual , sentient human be . she have the same right to control her bodily resource as any other person do . as such , you can no more force her , against her will , to provide bodily resource to an embryo or fetus , than you can yourself be force to give of your bodily resource against your will . even if somebody be bleed to death , and your blood can save their life , they still do not have the right to force you to safely give them of your blood . each person have that right to control their bodily resource . if you want to force the woman to remain pregnant , you be force her to give of her bodily resource against her will . when you do not insist that everybody else be subject to such requirement , then the argument be hypocritical and misogynistic . and , of course the us supreme court agree with this , thus rule that per the 1 4 th amendment of the us constitution , the woman have the right to privacy , to control her onw body .	0

so he fail to follow procedure ? so be one of the procedure to assist the child in hold the gun while the gun be be fire and to not stand at a distance ? if that ' s the case then the instructor at the firing range be also partially at fault because it be also his responsibility to supervise the child . and i just find this : `` springfield , mass . - authority in massachusetts be consider whether criminal charge should be file in the death of an eight - year - old boy who accidentally shoot himself with an uzi submachine - gun at a gun show . `` hampden county district attorney william bennett say he have not be able to find any law that would authorize a child to possess or fire a machine - gun . `` criminal charge possible in boy ' s uzi death , massachusetts authority say - yahoo ! canada news so not only be allow child to fire machine gun irresponsible it may also be illegal .	0
yes , but adam wasnt create with hereditary information or from sperm and egg cell . adam be the prototype . any subsequent human should be bear follow the fashion in which adam be make . otherwise adam could have be shape like a goat and still bear human child , because god could have form him into whatever shape or lack of shape he want , yet put the genetic information in him to produce human offspring . why should adam ' s child look like adam ? wouldnt adam ' s child be bear the way adam be create , or not ?	0
no , it ' s not an `` inability `` at all . it ' s a simple matter of you try to take what be a religious issue for many people and divorce it from religion altogether . that ' s not go to happen for many people . and btw , if you be go to refer to people as `` antis `` , at least be upfront about what you feel they be `` anti - `` toward . `` anti - gay ? `` `` anti - gay marriage ? `` what ? but behind that be deep , more fundamental issue about what homosexuality be and the morality of it . to many people who view homoseuxality as immoral , your movement seem to be try to write immorality into law .	0
well , now this be the question that really matter , and the answer be a long one . but to state it as simply as possible : denying same - sex marriage hurt many people . it force same - sex couple to pay for the marriage of opposite - sex couple while no one be force to pay for their marriage . it deny them access to raise child and ability to cover their child and spouse with their medical insurance , along with the many other benefit of marriage . it use the law to teach the people that the lifestyle and religion hold by same - sex couple be wrong , and this force them to feel the disapproval of society . there be no reason to perpetuate these harm . i have hear many argument oppose to same - sex marriage , but there be not even one of them that justify these harm . in fact , i would even say that there be not one argument against same - sex marriage that make logical sense at all . thus , even if same - sex marriage bring no benefit , there would be no reason to keep it illegal ; a free and equal society do not deny right or benefit to anyone , unless it have a very good reason to . and there just be not any reason to deny right and benefit to same - sex couple .	0

the purposeful taking of life regulate by the government be something that be decide by the people . the people decide what determine what be allowable and what be not . when it be acceptable and when it be not . this be do in agreement , obviously not unanimous . thesis law be create by the view of society at the time . our society permit the ability to change those law as our value change . you may call it murder , but you be wrong . there be no logical argument you can present to make your view correct . to suggest that legal abortion be anything else be an expression of your frustration why others do not share your view . there be no logic in your argument it ' s pure emotion and an immature understanding of how to cope with problem that do not go your way . if you think your view be indeed the view that be best for the people then be thankful in the us the opportunity exist for you to effect that . i can assure you though lie about it , sensationalizing it , bully people about it be not go to get many people to consider you . please do us both a favor before you go off on a discourse of the right , or feeling or value of the fetus remember what i say about we as a society decide what be acceptable and what be not . we make these law for ourselves for that reason , because we do attempt to value life . that attempt do not always satisfy all of the people all of the time , but it never will . i do not need a formula to understand how our society function nor do i stomp my foot and throw insult or intimidate people who do not see you be right . nor would i justify behavior that from anybody else concern something of less import would be unacceptable . if you do not like the law , then do something about it . if this be what you deem to be the best and most effective way to do that , i suggest you find a to become comfortable with it .	0
but let me guess . if they step down right after they find they will have to issue to gay couple , you ' d be in favor of them be able to be sue for it , simply because the `` discrimination `` in such an event be toward gay ? right ? at least if you be consistent with your stance elsewhere in regard to ' time ' . anyway , aside from that inconsistency with your position elsewhere , i agree that county official should need to comply . after all , there be probably other example whereby county official have to do thing that they be religiously against , such as issue divorce paper . or marry some drunk couple that they know be not really be serious even though they be tie the knot . if all county official could just refuse to do their job because of their objection - - for whatever reason - - it would be a collosal mess .	0

really ? i wasn ' t aware that the definition have change . i do know that a definition be formulate as part of the modern synthesis back in the 1 9 3 0 s and 4 0 s . that be the definition i learn some decade ago , it be the one i have always use , and it be the one that i still find in modern biology text . it be also the one that all biologists that i know use , and of course the mean definition of what evolutionary biologist mean when they talk about evolution should be determine by evolutionary biologist themselves . it seem kind of an empty exercise to invent a definition that be not what evolutionary biologist mean and then argue against it in an effort to disprove evolution . let me put it this way , do you think that it would be acceptable in a discussion of christianity if i be allow to invent my own definition of what a christian mean when he talk about salvation ? so please , please tell us about some of these change defintions . like i say , i have be use the same one for over 40 year and wasn ' t aware that it have change .	1

so what be the bible then ? simply a nice story - book for you to read from ? if genesis be simply a representative story from which we can interpret the action of god to mean natural selection and evolution , what about the ten commandment ? it always amaze me to hear people with position like this insist that it be okay to play fast and loose with their interpretation of genesis or the arc , but god really do hate the homosexual . it say so in leveticus , right ? so it must be word perfect truth . this bit about the origin of the earth ? oh , we just interpret that as god design evolution . but that part about people burn in hell for eternity , that ' s true , right ?	1
oh yeah , like that have not be try before / sarcasm it darn sure be not about crime control . no doubt some nefarious excuse to farther control the people and attempt to charge user fee to discourage a right . no doubt sinjin will approve so `` they `` can match fingerprint and type of ammo to the dros registration file ? the early bird get the worm after june , the best spot may already be take and kalifornia law will be shoot down and they will be leave with just what they claim to want . nothing economical , an end to registration , people carry loaded gun and buy case of ammo out of state ( no tax ) while cry wa wa wa wa wa ! do not forget jerry brown will probably have some change of his own . seem he be more pro right and 2 a than ' da terminator ' .	1
but the point be why be there relatively few creationists . the reason be that the creationist position can not be defend in open debate . that be why creationist board censor oppose view . on board where creationists be not protect there be few .	0

so sorry , i be try to figure out why god let some woman down , and yet favor you . i always assume it be a mixture of physiology , luck , etc . sometimes bad thing happen , sometimes good thing happen . but you claim god be the one who saw you through and make sure your daughter be bear healthy and functional . so , again , in a similar situation ( trust in god , doctor say baby will be bear damage , etc ) , if it turn out the doctor be right , be god to blame for let me down ? or be it , in fact , just the way thing be sometimes ? or do god just randomly hear some prayer , but not others ? no , no . lem me guess . `` god have a plan for us all `` ?	1
nobody i know sanction adultery . there be already serious consequence build in against it . as far a same sex marriage , i know of nobody that be suggest legal penalty for it unless one consider the refusal to legally recognize it a legal penalty . certainly nobody have be jail or fin for attempt such marriage . privately performed ceremony as such be not punish .	0

well let me say that so far that you have not be do a very good job . my argument be completely solid , and you have not even get close to refute them . you accuse me of be stupid because my mom watch star trek , you refute my argument by provide the defonition of masturbation and period , and then you call me illogical and tell me to think about my statement more deeply . [ quote ] you say that you can only abort in the first and second trimester , which i already know . but say that you do not exsist in these stage be a huge misstatement .

maybe you need to take a hard look at where your right start infringe on the right of others . a pretty good case ? dream on . sure , you have the rigth to take the morning after pill . you do not have the right to force another individual to sell you that pill , any mroe than you have the right to walk into your local ford dealer and demand that they provide your with a chevy . its just not the way the world work . people can go to another pharmacy or , not . it really do ntoy matter . retail establichments be able to decide fro themselves what they carry , the governemtn have no place in such decision . if they decide not to carry the pill , or the pharmacist simply decide they be not go to dispense it , that be their right . it be entirely an issue between employer and their employee and witht he the american pharmacist association policy that allow pharmacist to refuse to fill presciptions on moral ground , it be hardly an issue there , either .	0

yes chrstians should be disarm so the `` moral `` atheist , humanist , pagan who crucify people should rule over us . . . that would give everyone a warm fuzy feeling inside . matt 26 : 1 and it happen , when jesus finish all these saying , he say to his disciple , 2 you know that the passover be come after two day , and the son of man be betray to be crucify . of course there be valid reason why christ arm his men . roman 13 : 1 let every soul be subject to high authority , for there be no authority except from god , but the exist authority have be ordain by god . 2 so that the one resisting authority have oppose the ordinance of god , and the one oppose will receive judgment to themselves . 3 for the ruler be not a terror to good work , but to the bad . and do you desire not to fear the authority ? do the good , and you will have praise from it ; 4 for it be a servant of god to you for the good . but if you practice evil , be afraid ; for he do not bear the sword in vain ; for he be a servant of god , an avenger for wrath to the one practicing evil . 5 because of this , it be necessary to be subject , not only on account of wrath , but also on account of conscience . 6 for on this account you also pay tax , for they be minister of god , always give attention to this very thing . 7 then give to all their due : to the one due tax , the tax ; to the one due tribute , the tribute ; to the one due fear , the fear ; to the one due honor , the honor . luke 11 : 21 when the strong one , have be arm , guard his dwelling , his good be in peace . 22 but as soon as one strong than he come , he overcome him ; he take away his armor on which he rely , and deal out his arm . `` a moment notice . `` well it appear the guaranteed schedule time be on the day of judgment . luke 19 : 27 but these enemy of mine , those not desire me to reign over them , bring them here and execute them before me .	0
 no permit be require in virginia ! you can legally carry a firearm there if you be legally allow to own one . virginia perform an fbi background check and issue a permit upon request for those who would like the convenience of carry in another state that do require a permit . this statistic be just those who have request one ! imagine how many people who lawfully carry that have not request one ! i would imagine the number of folk legally carry be way more that those who have go through the trouble of file a request . yet , in three year , people who lawfully carry a gun have `` kill `` 107 people ? oh ! wow ! so us legal carrier have commit one tenth of one percent of all gun `` killing `` ? ( notice they do not say if these be justified or not . ) just to see how that look - - - . 01 % - - there . that ' s how it look : . 01 % . it ' s obvious why they do not compare this statistic to the average for the percentage of `` killing `` by the rest of the population who do not even carry gun . because it would show that `` killing `` by people who do not even carry gun outnumber `` killing `` by those who do by a huge margin . the vpc can not have that now , can they ? when you show the entire statistic , it make gun carrier look safe than the regular population . the horror ! it would mean the vpc ' s point of view would be . uh . wrong !	1

originally post by symbiote a ) in medicine , the use of antibiotic , the understanding of what cause resistance , and what kind of treatment can be use to avoid resistance . the knowledge that virii ( like the bird flu ) can easily evolve over time to spread through different organism , result in preventative measure to prevent deadly disease effect human . ender krum : this seem to be micro , not macro , evolution . i be still have trouble combine micro and macro evolution . could someone address the following statement from wikipedia on micro - evolution ? `` typically , observable instance of evolution be example of microevolution ; for example , bacterial strain that have become resistant to antibiotic . because microevolution can be observe directly , both pro - evolution and some anti - evolution group agree that it be a fact of life . `` walk - fish : the mechanism of mutation , gene flow , genetic drift and natural selection that work for microevolution below the specie level , also work at the macroevolutionary level ( why would not they ? ) . however , some biologist put more emphasis on the role of mutation of developmental gene at the macro level to push the change that lead to high taxon . the most often quote example here be that of stephen j gould , who propose that the jaw evolve in fish as a result of such gene cause a shift in the position of the first 2 gill arch relative to the others so they could be free to evolve as jaw . i think that these drastic genetic change would be the only discernable difference in the mechanism between micro & macroevolution . as for the `` typically observable `` example of evolution , i ' d like to add that observed speciation event cross the threshold between micro & macro . also , lineage in the fossil record be easily observable . genetic marker be , likewise , observable evidence of macroevolution . so it be perfectly legit to say that we can indirectly observe macroevolution by way of this kind of evidence .	0

i believe that the vast majority of people , if they be well - inform about responsible sexuality , have access to contraception , and be of reasonably sound mind , would much prefer not to experience an abortion and would take precaution to avoid such a possibility . it be rather tiresome to hear careless and irresponsible talk of whorish woman who seek to become pregnant solely so that they may exercise their right to an abortion . i have never meet such a woman . to be sure , there be unbalanced individual who be riddle with guilt over sexuality and these individual be incapable of be sexually responsible . i do not associate with such people and since i have never encounter such a person , i must believe that this sort of person comprise a very small minority . but with the amount of bluster and piffle to the contrary , i must wonder whether or not such blusterer have any connection at all to what really be .	0

i believe that ' s true , and as a `` believer `` ( creationist ) , here be what be hard to understand about that ; in matthew , 12:30 , jesus say `` he who be not with me be against me , and he who do not gather with me scatter `` . it be safe to say that both creationists and theistic evolutionist would accept that statement from jesus , and would seek to be `` with `` him , while agnostic and atheist would consider themselves `` not with `` him . yet theistic evolutionist be comfortable to ( usually politically ) be `` with `` agnostic and atheist , and separate themselves from creationists . if they be genuine christian , know about the warning in the bible about false teaching , how can they be comfortable with that ? miller lament in several place throughout the book that atheists use evolution as a weapon against religion , and that it should not be that way - that it cause more strife between the two than should exist .	0
i will not give up my right to vote . i will not give up my firearm . i consider people take my right to firearms as danger as people try to take away my right to vote . in other place around the world , firearm be much more important than the right to vote . there be people around the world try to get a chance to vote by use firearm to establish a system where they can use the right to vote . for self - preservation ? i will use a bazooka if there be tank comming down the street . the immediate threat i be thinking of be a felon with bare hand on parole . that be exactly what the anti - gunner be try to limit me from do . limit my right to self - preservation from a felon on parole . if you read the other thread , especially from vor , you will see he be about confiscation not gun regulation . i have ask many anti - gunner about confiscation , when they point to model of uk and austraila i shudder . those country be not about regulation , they be about confiscation .	0

well , that just mean i be a more capable lump of cell now than i be when i be first conceive . i start do what most embryos do when they be first form , and that be develop . i be still develop . i can not seem to stop it . i think my body have stop grow ( in height anyway ) , but seem to keep fill my brain with more and more experience . the point i be try to make be that since there be a continuum of existence between conception and death , there be no line you can draw ( save birth , which may or may not be consider an arbitrary boundary to personhood ) that would constitute some sort of a change in what you be . i start as one cell and continue to grow and develop , which i be still do now . if i be a person now , i be a person when i be the zygote . if we be go to talk about aortion in this society we should be honest about it and not try to mince word when it come to kill a baby . i be not `` anti - choice `` but i think we should honestly recognize that an embryo be a living human individual that die when it be abort . that think turn most people off so they have to make themselves believe that an abortion be not a killing since the embryo wasn ' t a person . logically , it be a killing . a life be end . the question then become , be it murder ? i do not happen to think that , but it be really quite subjective anyway .	0
actually they apologise because it ' s a bit of a fad amongst the limp - wristed politician at the moment . and anyway , the blood be fairly even on both side .	1
because gun be the best method available on the market . settle for second best when you could have the best be just stupid . well lock ? the best they will do be slow down the person seek to harm you , their effectiveness be contingent on the strength of the door they be on . alarm ? so somebody will know that you be in danger , what then ? that will not get the police there any fast than dial 911 . non - lethal weapon ? somethings non - lethal be a non - option . brandish a can of pepper spray will not cause an attacker to flee for their life , it will not hold them at bay until the police arrive to arrest them , it will not stop a violent individual from across the room , and it sure as hell will not affect somebody that ' s dope up on narcotic . and stun gun be more useless than knife , because as i have say before , you need to get right up against your attacker to use them . you have to get within stab distance to shock them , do you really want that to be your best option for protect yourself ? the idea be to keep the bad guy away from you , not let them get right next to you . all of these non - lethal device , they set up the false notion that the life of a criminal intent on hurt or possibly kill you , be worth more than your own life . that belief be stupid and should be do away with . ask any woman that ' s ever be rap if they feel that their attacker deserve to live more than they do .	0

it would be ' an ' analogy , but like the language analogy , it have its limitation . it be interest to note that creationist computer software developer / programmer can not seem to agree on the implication of ' mutation ' when use such analogy - one such person , c.k . lester , declare that computer program can accumulate up to 30 % ' random change ' , just like dna ( hypothetically ) can , therefore , the computer analogy be a good one . but programmer r . david pogge declare that even a single altered bit in a line of computer code a million bit in length would destroy it .	0

you may see a vast differene , many do not . the `` moral `` ground for many be simply the justification for their homophobia . so now it ' s a massive nation wide government conspiracy to stifle free speech ? canada stifle and oppress religious freedom ? honestly jyoshu , where do you get this stuff ? this be utter b , if you can find any proof of the canadian gov ' t stifle free speech on this issue , religious freedom , or any other issue for that matter , please post it . if not , retract your b statement , and admit that it ' s a fabrication . i honestly do not think i underestimate it at all . i come across a very broad spectrum of people in my line of work , from one end of the scale to the other . the most common negative response i get be from those that be oppose to homosexuality in general and respond along the line of `` i do not like , i do not want to see it , but right be right , as long as it do not negatively affect me , i do not have a problem with it / i do not really care . `` i have come across a couple of people who be strongly oppose to the use of the term `` marriage `` but be fine with allow homosexual `` civil union `` . i think you overestimate how big of a `` moral issue `` this really be for most people . waxy	0

the quad 50 full automatic anti - aircraft gun be design to oscillate on it ' s mount . this be so that the bullet will come out in a pattern . this pattern along with tracer round help the shooter guide the blizzard of bullet at the aircraft . even this only work at low altitude . modern plane typically fly at ~ 3 0 k foot . that ' s more than 5 mile high ! a perfect bullet , or one that be fire in a vaccum with an initial velocity of 2800 fps will only go ~ 2 5 k foot before gravity alone will have reduce it ' s velocity to 0 fps . the odds of hit something that be move at ~ 900 fps at any distance with a bullet travel at ~ 2 8 0 0 fps be slim to none . that be why anti - aircraft gun be full auto , not a semiauto or anything that a citizen have access to legally .	0
you claim god be unknowable ( partially or otherwise , it do not matter ) . you claim to know something of the unknowable , thus , you make a self - contradictory statement . again . for what . the third time ? drop it , you be argue illogically and i be embarassed for you .	1

so your claim be that the law of physic have change ? you see , it be not a matter of design . it be a matter of the physical limit of wood . wood be flexable , and the long the piece of wood , the more bend there be in it . possibly you have see a roof with wood support that span a large area . to do it require huge truss unless you add column support . and i will bet there be not any span of over 300 ft . where only a wood truss be use . for a ship / barge the problem become bad . if you make the keel thick in an effort to reduce the hogging and snaking , you reduct the room available inside . even at that , it would be impossible to eliminate all of the flexing and that flex would spring the plank of the hull . there be no calk that have be devise that can fill an ever change gap between plank . and , of course , recourse to a miracle be the standard creationist answer when face with evidence that their mythology be not historic . `` poof ! goddidit ! `` and so , what be the point of the whole exercise in the first place ? why do not god just poof the ark into existance or just poof anyone he do not like out of existance ? he want to teach the only just man in the world a lesson ? sure work . first thing noah do be to get drunk .	1

i be impressed ! this be a very precise description , in regular english and yes , the deduction in 9 seem presumptious if all we state be god have a `` possibility of existence `` . how this be cleverly clear up ( from the same source site ) be simply a trip back to the definition : `` great possible be `` . the `` great possible be `` , by definition , must have a possible existence . in otherwords , we can not assume that there be a possibility that the great possible be do not exist . yeah , it sound like the whole `` proof `` be pointless because your premise be already the proof just keep in mind that for the purpose of this proof , god be define as `` the great be possible `` . as long as that definition be maintain , the proof work . do that mean that god exist ? hmm . 	0

so once again you be steer away from the debate ? i do not understand why your ignore the debate and go off in a whole new direction even after make this same mistake in your last post . you be still show that the bible have a flaw in it and therefore your make up your own story about what happen . you be also make prediction about the future base on your own interpretation . i be sure you will not even consider that your wrong about either of these thing though i doubt you have any reason to believe in either of them other than you have the idea stick in your head now . [ quote ] the above fully answer the apparent contradiction you and others find in these passage . the reason you may think i may be present information contrary to normative christian teaching be that you have pick a peculiarly thorny passage - something that skeptic of the bible and enemy of god will almost always do . [ \ quote ] it only answer the contradiction after you fill in the blank with your own interpretation and of course your interpretation be base on your personal view and no fact . all the fact that you can work with be in the bible and as of this moment the bible seem to have a flaw in it . your try to cover this flaw with a story that you make up . i guess in your mind this make sense but i do not think many christian would even agree with you much less those of us who look for logic .	0

yea i agree with you on how there be no exact se t of law at the beginning of creation . the reason i say that they most likely do not marry their sister be mostly cause god get mad at cain and place a mark on his head so everyone he run across will not kill him unless they want to die a death 10 time bad than his . kinda just say that there be other people out there .	0

because of the rare nature of fossilisation , we do not expect to see perfect transitional lineage through million and million of year . i really do not think there be any scientist that think there should be million and million of transition , because of the nature of fossilisation . science be like a detective story . if you want to solve a murder , for example , you take a look at the evidence . you have a gun , spent round , dead body etc . to convict someone of a murder , you need fingerprint , blood on clothes , dna and such to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person you be accuse actually shoot the decease and you can convict without an eye witness . it ' s the same for science and the fossil record , because there be no - one around who directly observe animal undertake large change over time . but if you take a look at the fossil record , molecular biology , geological time etc , this be what it show . from what we understand from the last 100 or so year of evidence and investigation , biological evolution be the best scientific explanation we have for the diversity of life on earth . 3 question for calligirl . for the 4 th time . what would be your definition of a transitional form ? when calculate the age of this earth , how precise do you expect or want scientist to get ? how many transitional fossil would you like to see in what period of time ? i really do not think this will progress if you can not tell us what it be you would like to see .	0

yea . it ' s like order a pizza . first the paleontologist dig up a bone or other artifact . then he call the lab , tell them what he find and give them the date they can expect the bone to arrive for `` testing . `` then the lab ask him from what organism the bone once belong and also what toppings , i mean date , he want for his bone . then the paleontologist give him the range of date that most suit his presupposition . then the paleontologist send in the bone feed - ex , along with a gift - certificate to the fine steakhouse in town and two ticket to the ballgame , and then sit back and wait for the result . finally , just to be on the safe side , the paleontologist repeat this scenario with at least 2 more lab . this way just in case one do not cooperate he have backup and he can pick a date from any number of lab .	1

first of all not all astronomer believe that . all though it be a very long way to the close star we really do not know how far star be away from us it be not possible to know . it be an educated guess at best . if you base your belief on science you will almost always have to change them so be they really beliefs ? time and distance be 2 different entity . on the other side of the world it be a different day . a light year be the distance light would travel in a year if at the speed we have compute it to be on earth . how gravity affect light in space in pure specualtion as almost all of the cosmological theory be . black hole be create to explain the big bang . there be lot of astonomers that be convince the big bang be a myth . if the star be create near the earth and then streched out as the bible say they be the relationship of time and distance would be quite different and would explain how light from a distant star could be see . no one really know the answer so it be a matter of faith what you decide be true . both be possible accord to science . the power that be in science be atheist and get the most press . this do not make them right by default . there be a very good book on this subject starlight and time if you be interested in what a brilliant scientist who believe in creation have to say . i will be suprised if you be . i have read hawking and have him on audio and video . to be fair you should take some time and study the oppose view imo .	0

thanks . but it seem that you do not understand . perhaps the people of austin be more intelligent than they be down here in houston . maybe it ' s just that you be surround by educated people who show a tendency away from creationism . but you see , i run into people all the time ( and meet them on this board too ) who think that speciation have never be observe . why do they think that ? because their holy book tell them so . the herring gull / lesser black - backed gull be an example of a single , vast , globe encircle population that have become separate specie at the extreme of it ' s range - and those extreme overlap . before i come to texas the idea that the book of genesis be literally true never occur to me . so it be kind of a neat moment to realize that the big bird around the restaurant dumpster be herring gull , a living example of a population in the process of form separate specie .	0

really ? i have argue that god be an epic liar ? can you point out me argue that at all you epic liar ? once again you be interpret what i have say through that sick and unbalanced mind of yours , and then extrapolate that i be now argue in favor of call my god an epic liar . be it absolutely impossible for you to debate issue while actually respond to what we really say rather than read into what we say and redefine it to fit your warped and perverse perspective ? i mean , how sick and disturbed must your power of reason and logic be for you to interpret my argument that man , because of our linear view of time , be misread the fact that god place the star in space at the same time much more recently than it appear to us to have occur , that god be then an epic liar ? be god responsible for how we interpret the evidence when we attempt to do it apart from place him first and foremost into the equation ? be he the liar ? or be you who think like that deceive yourselves by ignore his place in the creation of time and space ? it be just completely beyond you to think from an honest and objective perspective , be not it obvious child ! but for a more practical answer , imagine this . in the beginning , space be a void which span all of eternity . only one object / energy source encompass all of it from one end of its massive emptiness to the other , and that person be my god yahweh . and in one second or minute time , he speak all of the star that have ever exist , at different intensity and strength , which cause them to burn out at different time . but he place them at the very inner and out limit of time and space at that time . liken it to a farmer with a hand full of seed . he pull back his arm and throw those seed to the end of the plot of land he be sow at that time . to the ant on the ground , if they measure the time it would take to reach the farthest seed , it would represent a great distance , but to the farmer it be just one arm throw in time to disperse hundred of seed at one time . now here we be as finite creature who can only see time from our linear perspective . time be plastic . our linear measure be man make for our convenience only . that you place what we call the measure of so call light year be arbitrary at best . but i be get too deep for you and this discussion . the point be that our god have the ability to place the star in every corner of not only what we again , arbitrarily call our universe , but throughout all of time and space . but to we puny finite human who have invent telescope , it appear that these star we be see today be ancient base on the perceive yet arbitrarily arrive at distance you believe they be from us . but since you be unable to even grasp the hugeness of our god , you also fail to appreciate that light year be a measure of distance rather than time . so by that definition alone , it be foolish to equate it with earth time rather than god ability to reach any distant place in time and space and place star there .	1

misunderstanding or misrepresentation ? biologist and geneticist do not claim that dna be isolate from the environment . we be well aware that the environment can cause mutation under many condition ( cosmic radiation , x - ray , etc . ) . what be deny be that mutation be environmentally direct - in other word , exposure to cosmic radiation will not cause a mutation that will make the organism resistant to cosmic radiation . the mutation will be random . on the other hand , natural selection be , by definition , the response of population to their environment . the environment have be show to have effect on dna , i . e . , the genome of the population .	0

to clive14 : darwin never produce a `` theory of human evolution `` . r - - i - - g - - h - - t . and i be a shakespearean act - -o- - r . darwin ' s book title `` on the origin of specie by mean of natural selection or the preservation of favoured race in the struggle for life `` sure seem to me to suggest that he have an idea on the evolution of man . darwinian evolution be ( and still be ) inherently a racist philosophy , teach that different group or `` race `` of people evolve at different time and rate , so some group be more like their ape - like ancestor than others . darwin believe , for instance , that the australian aboriginal be consider the miss link between an ape - like ancestor and the rest of mankind `` . many indigenous people die because of darwinian evolution , so do not give me such rubbish that darwin never do a theory of human evolution . darwin ' s evolutionary scheme go something like this : evolutionary ancestor - - australoid - - negroid - - mongoloid - - caucasoid . perhaps you best go home and check up on your own theory before you post such a remark . and people think that creationists be mis - informed ! this be true of the unscientific use of the word `` theory `` . in science , `` theory `` be equivalent to `` fact `` . there be a theory of gravity for example . be gravity just guesswork therefore ? once again , falsehood . if a theory be equivalent to fact , than why do they have two different thing . in science , use you above example , gravity be a fact ( i do not think that there be a theory of gravity , at least it be not in the hsc physic course when we be study it ! ) . by definition , a theory be an explanation of observed fact and law . it be support by experiment upon which it be base , and be confirm by experiment design to test prediction base on the explanation . now where in that definition be the word fact either use or imply ? now where , a theory be like a story to explain observed fact and phenomenon . a theory do not mean the idea be `` fact `` . it be just a story use to explain how some observe phenomenon may have either come into existence , or why and how it behave the way it do . you mis - interpretation of scientific term be note . i disagree . faith be believe something to be true regardless of the evidence . people have faith in the bible . people do not ( or should not ) have faith in evolution . i agree with your definition of faith . bible believe creationists must take it by faith that there be a god , and that the bible be the inspired word of god . evolutionist ( for the most part , i . e . most be atheistic ) , however , must take it by blind faith that there be no god and that the bible be not the inspired word of god . your last sentence strike me as to how brainwash some ( or many people ) be in the lie of evolution ( microorganism into people evolution ) . for one , evolutionists must take it by blind faith that stuff have evolve , i . e . there be very few fossil that support this notion . the fossil record dismisses and be a crush critque of darwinian evolution . for example , dr ronald r . west ( paleoecology and geology ) state in his article `` paleoecology and uniformitarianism `` which be publish in compass , vol . 45 , may 1968 , p . 216 : `` contrary to what most scientist write , the fossil record do not support the darwinian theory of evolution [ microorganism to man ] because it be this theory ( there be several ) which we use to interpret the fossil record . by do so we be guilty of circular reason if we then say the fossil record support this theory . `` in addition to this , dr david b . kitts ( school of geology and geophysics , department of history of science ) in his article `` paleontology and evolutionary theory `` in evolution , vol . 28 , september 1974 , p . 467 say the following : `` despite the bright promise that paleonotlogy provide a mean of `` see `` evolution , it have present some nasty difficulty for evolutionist the most notorious of which be the presence of `` gap `` in the fossil record . evolution require intermediate form between specie and paleontology do not provide them . the gap must therefore be a contingent feature of the record . `` what they be say be that the fossil record do not show evolution , but we will continue to believe it even though we have no proof of the theory of evolution ( i . e . microorganism to man evolution ) . evolution have be proven . creation have be disproven . this whole argument be over stubbornness on the part of people with faith who can not bring themselves to accept that evolution have be prove and creation have be disproven . four word that always get an evolutionist into trouble , `` evolution have be prove `` . if you refer to what you call `` micro - evolution `` ( to which creationists call `` varriation within a `` kind `` `` ) than i would agree with you . specie change all of the time , but it be important to know that the specie never get more complex , they be constantly lose gentic information ( i . e . dna ) and become less complex . with natural selection , thing lose an ability that will enable a specie to survive in an environment ( usually by the way of mutation ) . so since varriation within a kind ( or micro - evolution - always a loss of dna ) have be prove , this be also further evidence to the creationary model . the macro - evolution have not be proven . nor do the fossil record bear out many evidence for this , as many lead evolutionary scientist have ( or be comming ) to realise . creation have not be disproven , as you falsely claim . otherwise , the evolutionist here on this forum would be able to hammer the creationist argument , and thus far they have not . this fact alone be evidence against you . they only gain an advantage when we start have silly debate on thing that i do not know much on , nor have study up on , such as geological feature for an example . we have the same rock , so of course the evolutionist be go to claim that in many case i be wrong - as they have a different interpretation to me . or they have a different story to explain who a land structure get there to me . both story be base on the evidence , so it be hard to get through to one another . sadly , time restricts me from continue .	1

among the icon ( idol ) of modern mysticism there be one that reign supreme . it be the myth of evolution . we scoff at the god of the anchient pagans as if we be untouched by their superstition and yet we mystify our science with the like of darwin , the high priest of natural selection . darwin teach a fable that start in a warm little pond and through a process that have become know as gradualism ( minute change over eon ) all life arise out of a primordial soup . life be not chaotic it be orderly and require replication . without this you just have a lot of chemical mix in an infinite variety . the reason that life must be derive from life ( biogenesis ) in the mind of most be that this be the only way we have ever see it happen . `` you can imagine anything you like but you can only understand the truth `` as newton say . now if amino acid be the mirror image of nucleic acid sugar and this in true of all living thing then we be limit to this as fundamental to life . this in my opinion be the fundamental first step and it can not happen peicemeal , it all have to happen all at once . one more thing , evolution be a biogenesis theory and actual evidence for abiogenesis be rare and fragmentary just as it be for every other aspect of the single common ancestor model .	0

there be a few slight problem with that theory . first of all the evidence fit perfectly with that book you speak of . if predicts that all creature come about suddenly and completely form . this be all we have ever observe . the early creature - accord to your theory date - have incredibly form eye etc . and no ancestor among the fossil it also predict that animal will produce the same kind of animal , this be all that have ever in the history of the world be observe . + it predict the heaven will show a perfect order and can be use for sign and for season and for day and for year . that be all that have ever be observe in the history of the world . it predict that record human history will be less that 1 0 k year . that be what we observe . it predict that man have always be intelligent and ancient language and building confirm this . it predict that billion of fossil will be find in rock lay down by water all over the world , this we have observe . it predict there will be pathway in the sea , this be so . it predict that the heating of the air will create wind and this be so . it predict that the sea be the source of rain and it be so . it predict 800 year in advance that the messiah the king would ride in to erusalem on a donkey to the exact day . that he would be crucify and his side pierce with a spear and cry out my god , my god why have thou forsake me ? and it be so . it be predict the one who crucify him would cast lot for his garment and they do . that three day later he would rise from the dead and he do . that dna mutate do not prove anything other that it mutate . it be almost always harrmul or fatal and have never be observe to change one kind of an animal into another . that the specie that adapt to their environment survive and those that do not die be a self evident truth not evidence . about as intellectually stimulate as say most thing who fail to survive die . fossil exist . now that be a brilliant statement . why not say , water exist , or sand be ? all date method be base on circular logic . if the date agree with the theory it be correct , if not it must be contaminate . it be base on an assumtion of the quantity of some radioactive substance in a material at some time in the past and how much have decay when compare to the rate of decay give us a date . fortunately we already know the earth be very old or evolution could not have occur . we know how old fossil be because of the rock they be in and how old the rock be by the fossil in the rock . if the 2 be in the wrong place then we know there be an overthrust which be basically a miracle from god which be allow because evolution need it . life form in the million so therefore it must have start out as a random bunch of chemical that create itself on a planet that create itself and evolve into the million we see now . another brilliant deduction . you be on a roll . believe our eye . oh you must mean all those time you be walk down the beach and trip all over the lobe fin fish come on shore for the first time . or the thousand of time we have see a lizard with half a wing or a beaver give birth to an armadillo . yes , see be believe . you present a brilliant argument . how could anyone argue with your brand of logic ? that would be senseless .	1

yes , because its their decision , its their stomach , and its their life . i agree that some decision do need to be make with parental consent , but not this one . irrelevant . how do purchase a house have to do with abortion ? ok , so what if the kid want to have the baby and the adult want to get rid of it ? what if the adult want her to have the baby and the kid want to get rid of it ? you would force the kid to have a child ( that do not seem responsible at all ) , or you would force the kid to abort her child ( thereby take away her son or daughter ) . both of those decision do not sound very consitent or responsible . the decision be best leave up to the person that be pregnant , regardless of their age .	0
so be you say that if one person pray for another person who be sick , that if the pray person believe enough then some power of belief within him be great enough to heal another person who have no such belief , but that be not a miracle that can be attribute to god , but be just something the person pray accomplish because they believe enough ? so when i lay hand on my 9 month old daughter and prayed for her healing in jesus name , when she then within 5 second open her eye and go from completely listless with a 103 degree temp to wide awake , happy and affectionate as she smile at me with bright little eye , be you say that something within me transfer to her to bring about that instant result ? if that be true , then you must admit that something supernatural still happen , it ' s just that the power to heal transfer from me instead of from god whom i ask to heal her in jesus name . now mind you , i totally reject that , as i know it be god heal my daughter because i know rationally speak , that i have no supernatural power within me . and i truly understand how difficult it be for someone who have never personally experience a miracle to not be skeptical about miracle or the supernatural , and maybe if i have experience only one in my life then i too might question if it really happen . but i have have numerous angelic intervention that can not be deny . and the personal spirit fill contact with my heavenly father on a daily basis be more than one such as i be can even fully appreciate or comprehend . because you see , i be a sinner and completely unworthy to be in god presence at all , yet he have live within me and fellowshipped with me each and every day of my life since i accept jesus as my savior in august of 1975 . and if you want to believe me , 2 of the angelic intervention i experience happen before i be even save in august of 75 . so as it be write , before the foundation of the world , god know me . and while i be yet in the womb , he know me . and while i be in the womb , he know the number of hair on my head . so also , even before i accept jesus and be bear again , my father in heaven know me , love me and protect me until the day of my salvation . this be why i be so adamant and stubborn in my belief and can not be move by any unbelief . if i deny jesus and god truth with all of the personal and first hand supernatural experience i have have , i would be less worthy than the great evil doer and unbeliever in the world to receive god grace and love as i have . i have prophesy , speak in the language of the angel , be supernaturally save from drown , be save from a violent attack which may have lead to my murder as i have 5000 in cash on me at the time . but my guardian angel intervene and run the mugger off and they never find the money . that be just one of the intervention and all i do when i saw the trouble come be say within my mind , `` lord jesus , help me `` . nothing i do stop the attack , nor could it have as these people have murder in their eye . i have never see such cold blood hatred in any person eye before as be in this one guy . and yet within second i saw that rage in his eye turn to abject terror as he look past me , then he say to me , the next time i will kill you and they run away like total coward . when i turn around to see who have scar them so much and look exactly where they look when they look over my shoulder , you know what i saw ? absolutely nothing . there be nobody there at all , no human anyway .	0

so you be not an american ? you believe that your religion should be force on everyone by the government ? be it ok if i be allow to teach your child my religion ?	1
yes , and since some might not , it should not be mention at all ? personally i only know a half dozen people who have have abortion ( at least that i know if ) . 1 of them do not care , she have have 6 or 8 abortion . pretty much use them instead of the pill . 2 be pro life zealot now and feel terrible about the fact they have aboortions . 2 be pro life , but not zealot . the final one be overwhelming pro choice prior to her abortion . attended rally and everything . she felt so bad about havinghte abortion afterwards that 6 month later she blow her head off . she could not get it out of her head that she have kill a baby . she become totally obsessed and finally crack . so , yea . maybe it be not so out of line for people , include men , to say `` think about it real hard because a lot of people regret it `` . you do not have to get shot to know it hurt .	1
because none of these issue be raise in the heller case ! what ' s the matter with people like you ! your statement be like claim that the supreme court obviously think abortion be alright because they do not address the issue during the heller case .	1
actually quite a common name in south america . but i know what you mean .	1
but you have not look . you may claim that your god do it , and no evidence to support or deny that can be offer . the assertion relies on miracle and have no suporting evidence . but when you start talk about how your god do it , your claim can be debunk by fact . certainly the mythology of ancient nomadic herdsman be not accurate . if you look at the world and the history of the world the be evident in the geologic stratum , then you can see that the earth be very old , and you can see a succession of organism through time . when consider with other field of science from genetics to biogeography to physiology and anatomy , evolution becomes apparent .	0

look over the heller ruling again . all nine judge agree unanimously that the second amendment protect a right that be wholly individual in nature . the only disagreement be whether the right still apply today . and no , the individual state and city should not be allow to set their own standard for a constitutional right , that fly in the face of the 1 4 th amendment . and bad , you be argue for precedent that would basically allow the various state to not respect your other right ; they could ban the shirt you choose to wear because it ' s offensive to some small , insignificant minority somewhere .	0

and you people whine at me about use personal insult ( ) . anyhow , once a fetus be eight month , i believe , they be fully develop and ready for a premature birth . i be bear prematurely , so do not tell me it do not happen . so if you get an abortion at eight month , you be not kill a fetus , you be kill a baby .	0
actually you be wrong . actually you be very , very wrong . the 5 th amendment , and all the other amendment in the bill of right , only provide protection against government interference , not interference from your neighbor and people who do not have governmental job . but just for the sake of argument , if you want to argue how the man ' s right be violate , how about we discuss the right of the woman ? do not she have a right to not be rap ? do not she have a right to be secure in her own home against force invasion ?	0
stop tell me to look at the big picture when you have have both of your eye gouge out ! your entire statement here be beyond stupid . if the criminal felt that the only time to be arm be when their intend victim could fight back , then the criminal in dc would never be arm and the police would not have need to introduce gun shot sensor in the city . but since dc be the murder capital of the united state , that say an absence of hard target be not a guarantee that the abuser will play fair and not use weapon .	1

well that may be your contention , but medically that be not necessarily true . maybe be gay do not mean you be suicidal or depressed , but there be more of it go on in the gay life than in the hetero . that in itself be a wake up call . depression and suicide be harmful , even if it do not touch you personally . if it be as simple as you say the apa would not be re - evaluate `` reorientation therapy `` would they and with positive critique too . you would not have prominent gay activist like camile paglia deride the gay community for be malcontent when those unhappy with be gay seek and desire the way to be hetero .	0

you not differentiate between the beaver and the beaver dam , the bird and the bird ' s nest or the man and the man ' s truck . the dam , nest and truck do not occur naturally . they be construct by the naturally occuring animal use material that occur in nature ( albeit we have to smelt the iron and vulcanize the rubber whilst the bird and beaver just stick stuff together ) .	0

because feel safe be not the same as be safe . the people on the airplane of september 11th felt safe just before the terrorist take over . the virginia tech victim felt safe before they know about the killer that manage to slaughter 32 innocent . everyone involve in any major massacre have always have plenty of reason to feel safe right up until the killing take place . but the fact remain that none of them be safe . if they be safe then they would not have get kill . feel safe be nothing more than a false sense of security that can be destroy at any give moment . i ' d rather not be a victim of some violent incident and mistakenly believe that it could never happen to me . i ' d rather actually be safe as oppose to just feel safe . feel safe be just that : just a feeling , it ' s not anything tangible , it ' s not something that will do you any good if somebody decide that you be go to be their next target .	0

since i be there , i will give you an objective rundown : 1 . ) dawkins do not `` crash `` anything . he watch the movie without say a word and participate in a q & a session with the producer at the end - - a session that the producer deliberately start . 2 . ) there be no `` sneak `` on any level . pz , his daughter , and i all register our name over the internet for the event and select the option to have up to three guest come with us . we register our real name , our real address , our real telephone number , and our real email , and we all receive confirmation email approve our registration . 3 . ) what possible reason do they have to deny pz a viewing of the film ? dawkins and i press the producer mathis on this issue , and he say it be about money - - he want pz to come back in a month and pay his $ 10 . but this make no sense . pz be pay $ 1,200 for his interview . they thank him for the interview in the credit . if money be a concern , they could have pay him $ 1,190 and give him a free reservation . just the fact that he be in the film should have be enough to warrant a seat at a pre - screening event . this all beg the question : what in god ' s name be they so bloody afraid of ?	0
you mean , intelligent design , which have be prove in court to be not science , and to be a front for certain religious agenda ' s , and straight forward argument base on ignorance of the evidence and logical fallacy . if you look at the organization that push i.d . , you will see they have a religious agenda . the discovery institute be fund by religious organization , and every one of the board will admit they thing the ' intelligent designer ' be the christian god . read the ' wedge strategy ' from them .	1

so , we on this board be not receptive to your proselytize ? sorry about that . this particular forum be intend to be a scientific discussion , base on logic and evidence . we certainly do not want to waste your time . the door be over there . i find your dismissive , superior attitude to be offensive , to be honest . , so i can not say i will miss you . but should you ever want to discuss evolution and creation in term of actual science you will be welcome to return .	1
then you freely admit that you lie when you say this , and i quote : people like arch be set it as oppose to science and in that position it will be doom to fail . and arch be do nothing but distort the very thing he hold so dear , i mean , how be accurately quote passage from the bible distort it in any way ? you do nothing but post drivel which make no factual statement at all . and you call that debate ?	0

my first line of defense for up to 300 yard be an m4 ( specops m16 ) flattop with an acog scope and tritium backup sight , 14.5 barrel with a 1 / 7 twist with mccluek ( sp ) muzzle brake to make it the legal 16 inch . foward pistol grip and a surefire light mount to my knight rasii . i keep 45 grain in the clip so they frange and not penatrate wall . i keep a second clip with 7 7 gr noslers in a mag - cinch clip for long range shot . i use a long range shephered scope on my . 308 chamber m14 for shotting zombie out to 1000 yard . and to compliment my defensive ability i keep a romanian ak in my bugout bag with a surefire light and an oko red dot scope for quick egress when reliability be of most importance and close range firefight be likley . ( this in not to mention the plethora of pistoles and handgun i keep for home defense also ) . the m4 be 1.5 moa , the m14 ( m1a ) be sub moa , and the ak be a typical 3 - 4 moa . btw . i have have military and civilian training in all of these weapon i also keep a well trained caucasian mountain dog roam the house at night so if anyone where to make it inside i doubt there would be anything leave of him by the time i get there . preparedness my friend . now vor probably keep his rechargable phone next to his bed and a whistle around his wife neck and a fancy pug roam the house . dear mr . criminal , which house would you like to break into . sincerely , 1 constitutional right violator and 1 law abide citizen .	1

no i do not . i want child ( at least my child and family ) to be place in a school where they do not have to worry about one of their classmate pull out a tech 9 and go on a rampage in the library . i do not think that be too much to ask . i think eliminate the risk of this make a school a much more effective place to learn . how many people do you think actually learn anything at columbine the day they come back to school , or perhaps be they a little distracted . i be all for the government give you and like - minded extremist your own school ( hell , even your own state . why not ) and let you all carry gun into school and every other place you want to . as long as when a gunfight break out at your school in rottencrotch nebraska , i do not have to see all the parent on tv cry and bawl about how could this tragedy happen here , and say that something should have be do , this never should have happen . i think there be a time and place for gun , but i do not think that gun belong in school .	0
you then cite the wikipedia entry on spencer :	0

you be exactly correct in regard to my intent . imho , the allegory of the bible be mean to teach the spirit of the story , not actual fact . just as santa claus and the easter bunny be mean to represent the spirit of the season . when we be young child , we tend to believe in santa and thumper because our parent play the game so well , then as we learn the truth , we put away the belief that they be real but we pass the spirit on to our own child by play the same game with them . aimho , god teach us the spirit of creation with the inspired allegory write in the bible . god create it all , he just do it in a fashion we will likely never fully understand . aimho , there be thousand of adam and eve , create after an evolutionary process that start when god create all matter and time . i be not try to warp the bible at all , just as i would not try to warp the meaning of santa claus , even though i know he ' s not a jolly fat man living at the north pole surround by elf and fly reindeer .	0
really ? i have not see you post your support for any law or proposal that would punish criminal in the most severe way possible . all i have ever see you post support for be more law that criminalize thing that be not crime and do nothing to harm others .	1
but you can not . you may imagine it but you can not present evidence that support your position . you can only argue against what you do not understand in the first place . i generally make it a rule to keep my mouth shut unless i have actually have the integrity to educate myself about the basic of a topic . you do not seem to do the same .	0
do i claim you do start the thread ? vitroilic hatred , nope pity be the word you be need there . no i merely point out your style of debate . which i notice you make no attempt to say it be wrong . hence guilty as charge simone . yep that would be the left ' s method for free speech . speech you do not want to hear be ban . on the flip side any conservative speech need a liberal counterpoint . be i right simone baby ?	1
oddly enough , the mass constitution read : article xvii . the people have a right to keep and to bear arm for the common defence . and as , in time of peace , army be dangerous to liberty , they ought not to be maintain without the consent of the legislature ; and the military power shall always be hold in an exact subordination to the civil authority , and be govern by it . so apparently they come to their sens later .	1
biblical literism be the only way to view the bible . i could ' metaphorically ' say that dawkins really believe in god in his own way , because he say that id be possible for this planet because alien may have seed the first self replicate molecule here million of year ago . that be silliness or even foolishness . nothing take literally from the bible be irrational . god be rational and his creation be rational . in fact , the `` scientific method `` originate from the idea that the physical universe operate on rational physical law because the creator do it in logical fashion . what do we have b4 that ? `` dragon eat the moon during an eclipse ' ? angry god cause volcano to erupt ? apollo race his fiery chariot across the sky every day ?	1
but still , if you think there be right in the bill of right that be wrong , that should not be grant or guarantee , it would be a viable option to vote for remove them . what debate be you try to end here ? the debate : ' do you want little or less gun - control ' ?	0
and by old fashion i assume you mean greece a couple of thousand year ago . that ' s the only place and time i can think of off hand where the populace ( by which i mean land men in this case ) could vote to change law . in this country the correct procedure for a citizen to change an unjust law be via the court , and always have be . however , i do not think that be , in fact , what jyoshu be refer to .	1
no archie i would not dare do anything sexual outside of the missionary position without a ring on my finger . as far as superior or good umm no archie . as a governor of a state he have to be for all people not just the one that fund his campaign . unless of course the constitution be flaw and there ' s a tiny little clause exclude him from uphold all aspect of the document . and once again your god command archie not america ' s god or every person on this planet . do not you understand that there be a separation between church and state ? or do you throw that out the window too ? oh and the state of texas be make school child take a bible class . do not matter if the kid an atheist or agnostic or do not believe in it or be raise differently their still make them read it . way to go texas for overstep the boundary of church and state . but no archie i be merely state that this nut do not consider gay or lesbian equal people under the law where they need protection . do not matter that i can pull up thousand of incident of hate crime due to a person sexual orientation , do not matter that gay and lesbian teen be harass up to the point of suicide let alone god forbid their allow to even have right . point be be a public official elect to serve and protect all people under the law for the common good have state just to do the opposite . 	0

believe that god doesnt exist or acknowledge the fact that evidence to support the existence of god have never be find do not equate to science be anti - religious or that science hat religion . in fact , the one thing that both science and religion have in common be acknowledge that belief in god be not base on observable evidence , but rather an individual choice to apply faith in something which can not be see or prove . on the one hand , religion continually reach that in order to believe in god , you must have faith that god be real despite a marked lack of evidence for god ' s existence . science conclude the same thing : that people who believe in the existence of god do so solely by faith , despite the lack of observable evidence to back this belief the bottom line be that science do not make religion obsolete by reiterate the fact that there be no evidence for god . religious people also already know this , and believe in god regardless	0
i do not give a damn about the circumstance of the unborn either ( obvious here i be not say i do not care what happen to either , but for the sake of whether or not we should kill the unborn this be my stance ) . neither one should have a right to kill the other . and for that matter , no one else should be allow to come up and murder the woman or the unborn . so my view be still treat them as equal . and i will ask you to stay away from more assumtions that you can not prove .	1
evolutionary scientist be a confusing term . a geochronologist might work out an age for a lava sample for example . astronomer have also make comment on the age of the earth as have paleontologist study certain fossil . so why would no flood make radiometric much more likely to accurate as you say ? can we hear some specific detail on this as it be kinda significant to back you your assumption .	0

and where do they find the participant for this study , bath house and bar ? gay men be a hidden population in statistical relms . it be very hard to get a true random sample of data on gay men . study will say whatever the funder of the study want it to say . you just get data from the right place . if you want gay men to look like rag alcoholic get your study participant in a bar . if you want them to look like sexaholics then you get your study subject in bathouses . the truth be that to have honest statistical data you need random sample .	1

just a guess on my part . but it ' s probably one of the only factor that separate our advanced industrialize nation - - as the only one still have the death penalty - - from savage place like afghanistan , etc . have a doctor allow the self - deceptive veneer that a most uncivilized , inhumane act , about to take place , be somehow civilized or humane . and not the bloodthirsty , venomous , purely vengeful thing that it be . he sound like a very principled individual to me . with this , yet one more indication that the death penalty system in our country be unsustainable . not only for moral reason , but because it be not show to serve as an effective deterrent , and because the overwhelmed system be not supportable , under our american constitution , often punish everyone involve , even the family of victim . ( i . e . these case go on for year and year and year and year . there ' s no closure for people . )	0
oh , it certainly be an issue . martin killias , a swiss criminologist , do find a link between gun ownership and homicide in switzerland . however , my point be to ask you if you would be willing to abide by such regulation . the law in switzerland require that military weapon keep in the home be unload and store under lock and key . i do not think switzerland be a gun - nut utopia .	1

what in the name of heaven be `` passive particulate selection `` be that found in quantitative genetics in some obscure corner - i challenge you to produce a reference to the term in the open literature . and mendel ' s theory be itself ( if anything be ) particulate in nature and it be not derive from darwin at all . it precede darwin and later of course do serve as a plug in addition to supplant darwin own inadequate theory of inheritance . and of course mendel be long ago supplant by much more detailed and modern genetic knowledge . as to `` dynamic sytemic adaptation `` i also suggest you need to document where that term originate from other than yourself . just what do that mean which be not cover by the vary - select - inherit process ? please tell us oh mighty lagomorph how antibiotic resistance arises by `` dynamic systemic adaptation `` instead of plain old vsi process and how you distinguish the two .

`` refute ? `` o ' rly ? first they start off define evolution as `` moleclues to man `` despite what evolution actually state . that further prof my point about strawman . they do not discuss what evolution actually be . furthermore , the whole notion that increase capacity and adaption be not increase complexity be insane . if i take a simple structure , modify it to form something more complex , be that not a change in complexity ? the whole idea that modify dna , change it , remove and add be not actually change anything be retard . and they be separate macro from micro . that ' s an invalid argument give that macro be nothing more then the aggregate of micro . a billion tiny change make a few large one . the second idiotic article cite natural genetic engineering . despite there be absolutely no evidence of this occur anywhere .	0

the word of god say otherwise . roman 1:25 - 27 - they exchange the truth of god for a lie , and worship and serve create thing rather than the creator — who be forever praise . because of this , god give them over to shameful lust . even their woman exchange natural relation for unnatural one . in the same way the men also abandon natural relation with woman and be inflame with lust for one another . men commit indecent act with other men , and receive in themselves the due penalty for their perversion . you have rewrite biblical christianity . 2 timothy 4 happy - 4 ( new international version ) - for the time will come when they will not put up with sound doctrine . instead , to suit their own desire , they will gather around them a great number of teacher to say what their itching ear want to hear .	0

well , man might someday gain the capability of fully synthasizing a molecule as complex as dna from scratch . of course , he would use the knowledge gain from study how various dna code affect natural biological characteristic in order to properly design that dna to achieve the desired characteristic . it might be even more difficult to then take that synthesize dna and put it in an egg and artificial womb that have no natural ( as oppose to artificial ) biological part , but even that might be achievable someday through chemical construction . all this mean be that humanity might someday be able to copy the method of nature to create a new be - perhaps even use creativity to create being of very different natural function than we see in our world . it be all interest to think about and could well be achievable within this century . we already be capable of a large degree of genetic manipulation through cloning and hybridization . one would think that it will only be a matter of time before more complex technology get develop . the other question , of course , be - if we could someday create new life use our technology , should we ? that would bring up a whole host of issue , include : - would we know what we be do well enough not to cause great harm ? - how would the being we create be treat ?	0

this be a statement write by someone who obviously have not read scripture . one of the most astonising `` proofs `` if you will , that the bible be of supernatural origin , be predictive prophecy . science can not , as you claim , `` explain `` everything , and it have no natural explanation for the prediction make in scripture . how can science explain through statistical probablity the over 600 prophecy in biblical writing that have come to pass ? also , how can it explain how supposedly uneducated people ( uneducated in the way of modern science ) write about astronomy as if they know about the universe as we do today . how could they have describe the hydrological cycle as we have only come to know it recently ? ecclesiastes 1 : 6 the wind go toward the south , and turn around to the north ; the wind whirl about continually , and come again on its circuit . how do they know that the earth `` hang on nothing `` when the accepted norm of the day do not even accept that possibility ? job 26 : 7 he stretch out the north over empty space ; he hang the earth on nothing . how do they know that the `` vapor `` of the earth rise to create moisture , that be seed by lightning with nitrogen and then fall as rain to fertilze the soil ? jeremiah 10:13 when he utter his voice , there be a multitude of water in the heaven : ? and he cause the vapor to ascend from the end of the earth . he make lightning for the rain , he bring the wind out of his treasury ? . hydrothermal vent [ 4 ] be describe in two book of the bible write before 1 4 0 0 bc ? more than 3,000 year before their discovery by science . genesis 7:11 in the six hundredth year of noah ? s life , in the second month , the seventeenth day of the month , on that day all the fountain of the great deep be break up , and the window of heaven be open . even though the bible be not a scientific text book and do not purport to be , nowhere be it scientifically inaccurate . in addition , many of the scientific idea you be so impressed with be nothing new to the bible . it be speak of these thing long before modern science spoke of them . the story go `` they ( scientist ) be slowly work their way to the mountain ' s peak painstakingly measure and analyze every step that they take . after many year of research , they finally arrive at the top of the mountain , scale over its leading edge , only to find a group of theologian sit there with the answer all along . ``	0

yes , on the ground of `` mostly likely `` we can make reasonable assumption . but we must still treat them as such . part of the catch of god ' s existence be that no evidence of his existence cn ever be find . if jesus actually physically perform observable miracle , even 2000 year ago , then it would surely prove that the supernatural can and do ( or do ) exist in reality . however , even jesus ' s ministry contradict the faith theory . how can god expect faith from those who have not observe on the ground of those who have ? if people can observe the manifested power of god in reality , then they have physical evidence that god exist . but this conflict with the nature of god from a biblical standpoint . in other word , the bible can not claim that physical evidence for the existence of god can exist , and then that it can not exist , without contradict itself . what we end up with be the predicament that any physical evidence that could possibly support god ' s existence be evidence against god ' s existence ( at least from a biblical standpoint )	0

they do not hate the concept , they merely reject it as be useful or necessary to explain the material universe . i mean come on what utility would a physic which incorporate miracle be ? nothing would be predictable and all utility would be lose . if you want all of science to be arbitrary and unreliable then all ya get ta do be inject miracle into the field . for example what value be f = ma { except when the diety will otherwise } . or e = mc2 ( god willing )	0

ah , i see . your reason be secret reason . on a debate forum , about gay right , you oppose it base on . well you will not say ! nice debate . who ' s really play the game here ? i have already list on a number of post why it ' s not constitutional . since you miss it ( it ' s only the first post in the thread ) for gay coupe right to be marry ( or the same legal status ) 1 . human right with regard to legal classifcation and the benefit therein be desire by comitted consent adult of the same gender . 2 . it ' s a contract between two consent adult . 3 . a contract that do not violate anyone ' s legal right or cause any significant ill effect to the public welfare . it ' s unconstitutional to allow one group of people access to marriage right ( hetero couple only ) , and not allow it to female / female and male / male couple when they be obviously lobby for it in significant number . it ' s now a public issue on a significant scale . of course , maybe if you have a reason for object to gays be treat equally with regard to the right of marriage , we would understand not only why you be reluctant to back your claim , but why your reason be also not constitutional . you can call it game , i call it justify my position while point out how opponent of gay right , such as yourself , really can not make any reasonable justification for their desire to restrict human right , other than say `` well i want to `` . or in your case . `` sh . it ' s a secret `` . you know what we call it on the debate forum when one side refuse to present or rebut argument ? lose the debate . i realize win and lose . i . e . be right and be wrong be not concept find in religion , where anything go . but out here in the real world action have consequence , and word . yes , imagine that , have specific meaning . you verbally support a movement that restrict human right , yet will not give us reason for your position . i find that appal . yet you be content with label me as `` play game `` . how ironic . - mach	1

that be not my logic . my logic state that ban doctor would cause more death and our current system do . you be try to debate that doctor be threaten withour realize that they have great reward as well . my logic be to look for the risk and reward and not just focus on one side of the debate . your logic be that since doctor cause death then they should be ban if gun be , correct ? then why be not it also consistant with your logic to believe that we should ban food since food cause death ? so let clairfy here , do you believe that gun have a good risk / reward than doctor ? if you have to ban one which would it be ? i await your sidestep of the question . lol , now your compare the jew to current us gun issue ? why do you choose to do this ? the risk - reward for jew be different than the risk - reward for the us . jew probably would have fair good if the german use japanise gun control law .	0

again monty have show that he do not bother to learn what he be talk about before he speak . it be not true that science have `` find `` the mitochondrial eve , nor be it true that it show that one person can have all the dna necessary for all the variation in human population . both idea be ridiculous in the extreme . the mitochondrial ( note spell monty ) eve be a mathematical concept . if the estimate of the mutation rate of mitochondrial dna be correct , then she live about 200,000 year ago or so . and of course , the variation in human population be carry by the nuclear dna , not the mitochondrion . high school biology student know this . and , of course , recent analysis have show that every gene in the human genome have an average of 14 allele . since a single person can carry only two allele of any gene , monty ' s assertion become pure nonsense . hank say :	1
the definition of manslaughter be when one ' s action , which end up kill someone , display a reckless disregard for the danger of the situation . that ' s not a proper legal definition , but it ' ll do . now , you want to argue that pro - lifer would be force into the counterintuitive conclusion that all miscarriage be manslaughter , and thus their position be ridiculous . i be say that they would only be force to admit that a very small portion of miscarriage be manslaughter , and a portion that they would probably be willing to make a case for . i be not say `` miscarriage be not manslaughter , `` but only `` miscarriage be not always manslaughter . `` for example , if a woman take perfectly good care of herself and do nothing dangerous , but have a miscarriage anyway , she would obviously not have commit manslaughter . if a woman have one drink with dinner , but she be carry a very unhealthy fetus and it die , then she would not have commit manslaughter , because that be not reckless . i point out the `` you - should not - be - drink - and - have - unprotected - sex `` argument as a position somebody might hold , but i think that it would probably be judge as unrepresentative of the definition of manslaughter . so obviously , miscarriage can not be manslaughter in the sense of `` every instance of a be an instance of b . ``	0

the 2020 global food outlook answer this as it say that a great demand for vegetable will correspond with high price of vegetable in develop country . many article acknowledge that starve people can not afford much of any of the food for sale around them , and a great demand for meat do not necesarily mean a decrease in demand for vegetable as population grow globally . since increase meat consumption be irrational because it will not fee the poor and it will do even more damage to the environment , again , the solution propose be to support the initiative for develop nation to become more self - sufficient in grow plant food for themselves .	0

zoo be indeed a good example . although the environment be make as close as possible to the natural habitat , penguin be often keep in open - air enclosures in temperate or even tropical climate . and there be two critical difference in even the most carefully construct zoo : the absence of any predator , and the absence of any prey . so why do not the animal quickly / purposefully / nonrandomly cease exhibit developmentally costly trait which give them an advantage against predator or prey who be not present ?	0

you know what be absolutely incredible about you little child ? you constantly make the most blatantly ignorant and irrational statement which have no basis at all in reality , yet you actually think you be be intelligent . ( note child quote in my siggy , below . ) and you really should look up definition before use word when you have no idea what they mean . do not you start a thread about that , hypocrite ? you be talk to a person who accept intelligent design as a rational explanation for man origin , yet you be so ill inform that you allege he be align with a belief in animism , when animism be found in pagan religion and assert that pretty much everything have a soul and spirit . animism ( from latin anima ( soul , life ) [ 1 ] [ 2 ] ) commonly refer to a religious belief that souls or spirit exist in animal , plant and other entity , in addition to human . [ 3 ] animism may also attribute soul to natural phenomenon , geographic feature , and even manufacture object . religion which emphasize animism in this sense include shinto , hinduism and pagan faith such as folk religion and neopaganism . animism - wikipedia , the free encyclopedia now show me a christian who defend id , believe that , you mental midget .	1
well , i do not really mean to go that far . but i be talk about problem like that all work out , think about previously , and that the problem be work out . i be talk more about , what if you could make laborer strong , scientist smarter , and rid us of physical and mental abnormality ( such as down syndrome , narcolepsy , etc . ) . i do not think of make everyone the same for that reason . i be just say , what if there be a way to good society without go overboard ? if the problem be work out , which i be sure they will be , what would your moral view on it be ?	0

that ' s so trite that it be meaningless .	1
oh . you just lose me . the fact be , jesus warn his follower that they would be persecute for his sake . read matthew 10 : 5 - 42 , if you care for the full text . basically he tell them they would be beat , throw in prison , crucify , and put to death if they follow him . and that be exactly what happen to the disciple and all those who give a witness for christ as lord and savior . the various roman emperor in those year of the early church seek to kill every christian they could find , men , woman , and child . christian be crucify by the thousand , cover in pitch , and sit afire to provide light for the emporer ' s lavish garden party . they be kill in the arena by wild animal and torture to death in numerous way . they be call martyr , which now mean one who die for a cause . the word be greek and mean “ witness ” . these witness for christ be kill for their faith . how many christian would we have today if they have to die for their faith ? in spite of everything that the emperor do , they could not kill the christian fast enough . more be believe in christ every day , and eventually even the roman emperor himself become a christian and christianity be embrace and sanction .	0

and you do not have any picture . you have no idea of what recessive really mean , do you . actually , since the first observation of a black peppered moth in 1848 , several other mutation have cause other variation of color in peppered moth . they be intermediate between the typica and the carbonaria , but they be extremely rare . these allele form a hierarchy of dominence in which the carbonaria be the full dominant , and the typica be fully recessive . please define `` kind . `` please define `` variation . `` please explain the origin of this `` variation in kind . ``	1
and that ' s what scientist will do . no change there , then . now , on the subject of long - hold religious view , how many so - call christian will have a rethink when present with new finding ?	1
incorrect . evolution be not something that must be adhere to . it be a scientific theory . as such , if evidence be bring to light that evolutionary theory could not account for , then the theory would be alter or scrap . it ' s really quite simple .	0
i see a subtle distinction here . creationism be concern with the spiritual origin of people . `` evolutionism `` be entirely concern with explain the nature and history of the physical world . the conflict of opinion arises out of the importance of the detail - can genesis be accept as a parable which contain a fundemental truth or must it be take as a historical account ?	0

so student do not deserve their constitutional right ?	1
i be glad to see you have finally come around .	0
well , give that your term be a fabrication of the creationist ' s mind , i suppose you be right . evolutionist do not actually exist . therefore you could assign whatever trait you want to them , include dishonesty . evolutionist be a term design to cast evolution as a faith base notion . the problem be there be no faith in evolution , faith be a belief in something with no proof . evolution have proof . therefore it can not be a faith base idea . a typical creationist attack be to misrepresent their target by create a strawman of it . they then declare it be wrong and by proxy , the actual theory wrong . it ' s fundementally weak , but inline with a belief that be scientifically unsound .	0

two thing , symbiote 1 ) what be the objective basis of right that make it different from other value judgement of the majority ? 2 ) when two right come into conflict , be the result always simple inaction ? 3 ) be the importance of right great than democracy ? or be democracy a right ? if the latter , how do this work with ( 2 ) ? 4 ) how do you react to the fact that in the sort of case i mention the result of a right system be clearly bad for individual people ?	0
evolution theory be not science at all , it be faith . period . how can i conclude that ? because an examination of the evidence show that a bias / ideology / godless belief system be the only real evidence for evolution theory : evolutionist stephen jay gould : ? our way of learn about the world be strongly influence by the social pre - conception and bias mode of think that each scientist must apply to any problem ? . evolutionary biologist richard lewontin say : ? we have a prior commitment to materialism . it be not that the method and institution of science somehow compel us to accept a material explanation of the phenomenal world , but , on the contrary , that we be force by our priori adherence to material cause to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concept that produce material explanation , no matter how counter - intuitive ? moreover , that materialism be an absolute , for we can not allow a divine foot in the door ? . 	0

personally , i believe that god do not exist , and i have a link , too ! by the way , sorry for all the link , but i have find that since creationism have be so well refute elsewhere , i do not have to do too much work . it also help that i be present evidence , right ?	1
so what be you try to do here - smother everyone with bafflegab ?	1
they only need 1 / 4 of the legislature , so they will probably get that . but if it actually get to the poll ? the conservative take a big hit when they run around scream `` if gay get marry society will collapse and we will all be doom ! 11 ! 1 ! `` and then nothing happen . and of course the most organized group in mass . oppose gay marriage be the mass . catholic church , and people be not go to take kindly to a bunch of child raper tell them what ' s right and wrong . the anti - gay side really do not have much to work with ; it ' ll largely be a contest of good will and common sense v . scare tactic , and the scare tactic have already be prove wrong .	1
traitor ? more like the boy wised up on the matter . so , brady , how ' s it feel to have all your work and hop destroy in the blink of an eye ? how do it feel to know that your last best hope for a disarmed society have abandon you by the side of the road , and you be now out of option and the only thing leave to do be eat the crow ?	1

what do spell have to do with your own opinion ? again this be not just about you although i think you do resort to correct someone ' s spelling and just do not answer the question . this have nothing to do with be entitle to your own opinion . it be equally bad for anyone to resort to personal attack on either side of the debate .	1
read above for why your argument suck . thanks for prove you never ever ever read anything or watch anything give to you . just assume whatever we want and hope people do not laugh at us ?	0

so there ' s no need to be outrage or question a candidate far just on the basis that he represent the less - of - two - evil to you ? you be use the fact palin be there to avoid need to take biden to task for his statement . if , hypothetically speak , palin wasn ' t there at all and biden have make the statement alone in a stump speech , you would just leave it at that and not take him to task for his position ? frankly , if he ' s the candidate you feel best support gay right , i would think this statement on his part would be more alarming , and all the more cause for concern . so biden be against gay marriage there too ? if he ' s against your right to marriage , know why might very well give insight into whether he would change on it at some point or actually be anti - gay in other way too ! frankly , i find this idea of not probe far to at least try to get some insight into motivation on issue to be pretty odd , let alone not criticize someone for an anti - gay view just because the other candidate be more anti - gay .	0

so what ? they be not worth anything , be they ? do it matter if we kill them ? no , in your reason it do not because there be no absolute .	1
just because you do not hold the same belief as we do , do not invalidate our belief . i feel sorry for you if all you have to believe in be a small petri dish of algae . you do need absolute proof if your go claim it as the only possible way of creation .	1
yes , they do show a faithful devotion to the ultimate reality that there be no god . you be an atheist , be not you ?	0
if we be create in god ' s image , then it would make sense that equally our emotion be a reflection of god ' s emotion . that our emotion be imperfect version of his . of course i would personally say that when man invent god , they felt the need to give him human characteristic in order to make their invention more understandable . and to assist in the oppression of others by the ever - present threat of an ' angry god who will smite you ' . an ' ambivalent god who be above that sort of thing ' just be not as good at convince people that whatever you say be right .	0
um , yeah , you could say that . ( will not argue . leave up to the evolution board )	0
like , i say , i can not take men ' s position on abortion seriously b / c they can spout off all they want ; however their viewpoint must be affect somewhat by the fact that they will never actually have to make the decision themselves . as far as circumcision . um . who care ? j / k . i really do not know what to think about that . never give it alot of thought , as i have never have a penis , do not plan on grow one , and therefore i can not have a valid point of view . do whatever feel best to you . get my drift ? hey , you two , clerisian and steve , quit argue semantics . geesh !	1
atheism be for cynical , self - righteous twit	1

what illogical tripe . the above be factually not true . it ' s also the garbage that the word of faith movement hang on to get people to conform to their message . seriously , i act like a 13 year old quite often . i only wish i ' d become one . simply becasue youth be waste on the young . i also act like a god . flex my might and power on a whim . i be still wait for adoration and worship . there be no ' act ' there either be or be not .	1

again , please review the definition of an atheist humor can not be observe by apparatus that test the physical realm . it be an abstract and intangible quality . so be beauty , artistic ability and pleasure . yet these thing exist and be as real to an atheist as it be to a theist . an atheist do not need a devine revelation to appreciate intangible quality or account for their existence . they can be detect through mental processing , and communicate so that others can agree on the quality and identify it when it be present . be an atheist do not preclude belief in the existence of intangible and abstract thing . it just preclude the belief in god and a spiritual / supernatural realm	0

wrong again sherlock . all of this animosity be after the fact to why radical islam considers our christian nation to be hypocritical due to the exporting of our pop culture of hedonistic sexual and moral depravity . that be why they sign fatwa against us originally . it be the abortion , gay marriage and our woman walk around half naked that cause that lack of respect to occur . and you can thank the immoral left for that contribution to americas image . it be the left that coin the phrase , `` if it feel good , do it , `` not the right .	1
i be hardly a phyicist , but i be under the impression that there be at least some people who feel there be reason that there be ' uncaused cause ' . i think that the term use be ' vacuum flucuations ' , and ' virtual particle ' . i be not aware of any peer review article on it , but a popular press book be ' achilles in the quantum world ' by richard morris .	0
your god be also the god of deceit . why else would he erase all evidence of such a flood ? why erase the bone from the animal that must have die as the emigrate from the ark rest place ? answer those two and i will have lot more	1
again your failure to understand what science be and how it work . whatever your apostle tell you , science can not deny that something you may have see be true . it can deny that it be not science if it can not be explain by naturalistic observation . most especially , if the observation can not be repeat by another , then it be not science . science can make no assertion as to what you saw . you may think it be wonderful , but lsd have that effect . how strange that you think that your emotion be scientific . actually , it ' s sad .	1
oh , i get it . so you believe , but you do not exactly `` believe `` .	1

please , i beg you , stop try to jam the world into your `` creation `` account through reason . you just will not get anywhere through reason , if your first choice be to believe the bible ( any religious work ) as truth , and go from there . what you just say be `` [ adaptation ] would be mutation by natural selection , not evolution `` first , the adaptation refers to the adaptation of the specie . a population of wingless beetle survives . the missing wing be the mutation , and be not cause by anything other than a mutation , it ' s not a result of their be wind , or there be a god , it ' s just a mutation in the gene code . the gene for the wing can dissappear into the endless gulf of other discard mutation since those organism that carry it will most likely die off before reproductive age . it can also be leave in the dna sequence , unused , and not active , unless some other mutation activate it . ( a large percentage of our dna seem to be unused garbage code ) . when this happen , your specie evolve . what be your point , that beetle can evolve ? yes , they do . all life on earth seem to . yet you do not think it ' s due to evolution ? mind - boggling . who be tell you evolution be `` bad `` or `` wrong `` ? only if you arrive at that conclusion without religion , can you even begin to have a discussion on it . evolution in life only require : dna replication mutation a natural environment ( that be , what we see here on earth , a complex system ) time which of these do you feel be `` incorrect `` ? we can prove any of these , why persist ? - mach	1

well , i see that hunter continue with his intentional ignorance . even though it have be explain to him on several occasion , he still chant his `` evolution be only a theory `` mantra in hope that his audience will be as ignorant as he . yes , evolution be a theory . in science that mean that it have be test and accept as essentially correct . evolution be a theory just as gravity be a theory - several in fact ; newtonian gravity , general relativity , and quantum gravity . none of those theory actually work in all situation . but for all practical purpose , evolution have be prove . that ' s easy since evolution have be observe and the theory be build on the fact of those observation . you will notice that hunter have not prove any of his assertion . he just know that there be talk snake , and magical being that make people out of dirt . sure - go ahead and start with the bible so you can get the mythology of two different creation story , an impossible flood , and such fantasy as a man be swallow by a whale or the any human would know about a god that wager with satan , out of the way . not only will you find no proof to support the bible , you will not evern find any evidence .	1

in other word , you think a supreme court decision should only shut down the debate if it ' s a decision you agree with . roe v . wade and heller do share some striking similarity . for example , scalia state in heller : `` nothing in our opinion should be take to cast doubt on long - standing prohibition on the possession of firearm by felon and the mentally ill , or law forbid the carrying of firearm in sensitive place such as school and government building , or law impose condition and qualification on the commercial sale of arm . `` however , the text of the constitution have as much to say about such restriction as it do about abortion . i have hear that scalia have be criticize for make such a statement because there be no clear historical precedent date back 200 year of ban felon from own firearm . so neither the text of the second amendment nor tradition justifies such restriction . it be an example of judicial lawmaking .	0

whether or not the 2 nd amendment be write to provide for the protection of the state from a foreign invasion , or border dispute , or civil war , it be clear that the objective of the 2 nd amendment be to address the basic provision and control require to form a militia reporting to the president . one of the provision to form a militia be explicitly state in the 2 nd amendment as the unrestricted right of the individual to own gun . at that time in our history , when a militia be form , it be expect that individual would bring their own gun ( s ) to the militia . that provision be the implicit purpose of the right of the individual to own gun . within the 2 nd amendment , there be no other implicit , nor explicit purpose pertain to the unrestricted right of the individual to own gun ( s ) . in other word , the 2 nd amendment do not implicitly , nor explicitly suggest or expand its purpose beyond what it require for a militia , and the control of a militia . the 2 nd amendment do not provide an individual the right to own gun ( s ) for the purpose of provide for : food , self - defense , target practice , a hobby as a collector , or fun . therefore , any other purpose or reason for the possession of gun that have be attribute to right under the 2 nd amendment be base entirely upon thought and purpose that be not in the mind of the found father when the 2 nd amendment be write . the found father know many people require gun to provide for food , income , and home - defense . yet , the found father do not separate the purpose of the unrestricted right of individual to own gun for a militia , from the sole purpose of own gun for the creation of a militia . the found father do not write the 2 nd amendment in a manner that would even suggest that the right of an individual to own gun have purpose beyond a militia , that would provide for : food , self - defense , target practice , a hobby as a collector , or fun . we may therefore conclude that , any reason or purpose for an individual owning a gun , other than for a militia , be not provide for under the 2 nd amendment , and that current gun law for private ownership of gun be mistake . justification or reason to provide individual with a right to own gun for a purpose or reason other than a militia , would have to be base on some amendment , other than the 2 nd amendment , to determine if any such right exists for individual gun ownership exist . that the found father do not write all amendment with the explicit and specific right of individual for every condition and circumstance be self - explanatory , as the size of the bill of right and the constitution would be enormous , and the founding father would still be busy write the bill of right and a constitution if that be the case . however , the found father be very careful in their use of word and phrase , and in the logical composition of a constitution , and that they decide not to specify other purpose exist that justify individual gun ownership , beyond a militia , in the 2 nd amendment . that decision would appear to be intentional . although it might ideal to understand all that the found father have in mind , when the constitution be write , it must also be understood and conclude that what be the basis for a rational give the found father reason to create an amendment , and choose specific term , phrase , and specific , may not exist today , nor even be of any importance . for example , individual need not carry gun from their home to where our troop will gather . today ? s ? militia ? provide for the a militia ? s need , and an individual ? s need for gun . what the found father once write with respect to an individual possessing a gun for the purpose of a militia and the remainder of the 2 nd amendment require revision or elimination .	0

so you plan to move out of n.y. in a year or two , and own a gun ? why not now ? n.y. law be sticker than most , but not all . you want to teach your kid to shoot ? good do it now , later on it will probably be hard . well if you do not think that gun control be the most important issue in the world and you totally agree that people should be able to own gun , but yet you have no problem with state make it mandatory for gun owner to have permit , thats almost a contradiction of term for someone that say their pro gun . i may be wrong but be anyone say or imply total gun freedom ? what we be say be , to many law on it no more . 35 - 40 year ago we do not have all this b.s . about it , you want a gun you go and get one ( in other word very readily available ) walk down the street with one and you do not have a s.w.a.t . team on you . we have see to many gun right take so yeah every time a new policy or amendment come along we be antsy about it . so if you support every amendment make to the constitution pertain to gun , than i submit your not to interested in own a gun . and for the record : gun tot bandit ( out here we say bandito ' s ) be jump out of every ally { figuratively speak } . but the pro - gunner know that if the anti - gunner have their way , only the bandito ' s have gun .	1

reasonable people would look for justification for their belief . many who have belief base on faith , however , accept thing because they feel like accept them . include , absolute truth , and contradiction . the resultant should be peaceful acceptance because after all , they can both be correct , yet be in contradiction , accord to faith - base belief system . the reality would probably be , as you say , that they would mix up faith and reason and start claim one be `` actually correct `` , and the other be `` the work of the devil `` , and proceed to clobber the other religion , absorb their member , abordb the tradition that be `` popular `` from the other religion , rename them and re - color them to match their religion , and carry on proclaim truth and the afterlife and mercy and whatever else pop into their head . that ' s of course , base on what i have see and read . - mach	0

if a child come in for an abortion and fear abuse from her parent then law enforcement should be notify . the only people protect by oppose notification law be abuser and pedophile . no elective , invasive medical proceedure should be perform on a child without the consent of a parent or judge . if a minor be allow to have an abortion without consent the parent / guardian will have no idea whats be do to this child should complications arise , they would not be able to give this information to a er doctor or the child pediatrition .	0

but when some be ignorant enough to believe in a false science like evolution , which be base on lie and deception , they prove right there that they have not enough knowledge of the truth , nor a sense of discernment that be capable of even determine what be true or a lie . so who be you people to even judge the intelligence of those who will ultimately be prove to have know the truth regard our origin , to the lie that you so proudly defend ? i say this only so you pseudo intellectual will have some personal introspection to consider rather than just assume that you will get the correct answer by lean on human understanding . it be incredible that you can not even see that you be bankrupt when you rely on unprovable assumption that be base on preconceived notion , that have be both fail and conflict with all of the new discovery make in each generation to follow , thereby force the need to redefine the parameter by which evolution work every 10 year or so . so evolution be not a science , it ' s a work piece of fiction in progress that be constantly be tweak and shape to fit the preconception no matter what new evidence be discover that contradict it .	0

clearly this be true . there be a multitude of denomination from every religion . this be as specially true with christianity because the text do not explain how all the ceremony be do . baptism be perform in area where full immersion could not have occur but the best explanation of baptism paint a picture of a full immersion . the church of christ believe one must baptize in the name of jesus , the father , son and holy ghost thing be while jesus live . because the practice of speak in tongue be use by the first church , some believe the art must stay in the church . most of the complication to christianity be simply because the follower really believe jesus would return . no one write a book on the religion . the religion change a great deal through time . king james be no saint and he have clear reason he would not allow some letter into an authorized version he would sign on to . one letter spoke of the sin of slavery . this be clearly at odds with king james . other item would have direct negative effect on the kingdom and i will let others find the reasoning behind the withdraws .	0

there be just one thing however . the coelacanth find be different from those in the fossil record . far , all evidence point to them be extinct , until we find other evidence , and we change it . and , to top it off , the article say nearly extinct , not completely . although , this article be of course write after the coelocanths be re - discover . of course , this have absolutely nothing to do with the theory of evolution , which explain the mechanism responsible for the change of allele frequency in population over time .	0
really ? if `` nature `` meant for all thing to reproduce through heterosexual method then maybe all other form of reproduction would not exist , hmm . they would have be `` eliminate `` because heterosexuality be far superior . think again . the majority of organism on this planet reproduce use binary fission ( bacteria divide ) , asexual reproduction ( there go your `` individual gratification argument ) , and zygotic reproduction . none of these thing require sex of any type . even animal that have `` normal `` sexual reproduction can reproduce use a process know as parthenogenesis , in which only a female be require to produce offspring ( turkey and lizard do this ) . if homosexuality be not natural or be inferior , then why do we see example of it in nature . the bonobo ( closely relate to the chimpanzee ) exhibit heterosexual and homosexual activity in both gender in the wild , and the bonobo and human share a very common ancestor . look , you can not say that one way of reproduction be `` the standard `` since it be clear that different specie reproduce in a variety of way . you also can not say that homosexuality be a disorder if you follow your previous logic that what be `` natural `` be valid . also , you say that heterosexuality be superior because it have a `` great purpose `` . by imply that something have a purpose , you stray from the realm of science by assume a teleology . if you want to assume that thing be give `` purpose `` by some high be , that ' s fine , but you will have to stick to religion to defend your argument . in science , it be impossible to assume a purpose . for example , what be the purpose of a river ? to flow to the ocean ? to carve a canyon ? to carry sediment ? you can say what something be good at do , or what it do , but you can not say what it be `` make `` for ( purpose ) without imply some grand design that can be easily provide by your local religion . as for hetero and homosexuality , it can be say that heterosexual be good at produce offspring than homosexual . do that automatically make heterosexuality superior base on the arbitrary criterion of number of offspring produce ? so in the eye of a value system that believe that something be value high that create more offspring or `` life `` , heterosexuality would be superior . but in the eye of science and reason , your argument do not hold water .	1

in a way , take right away be an american value since we have prescribe method for do it . for instance , we have legislature which pose authority to remove a large number of what you likely consider to be right . here be just a small number that come to mind : 1 ) right to murder 2 ) right to own slave 3 ) right to rape 4 ) right to abuse child 5 ) right to vote 6 ) right to smoke ( if you be under 18 ) 7 ) right to drink ( 1 8 th amendment ) happy right to engage in certain activity in public 9 ) right to drive as fast as one want 10 ) right to dump dangerous chemical in the near river the list go on really . the fact be that you do not object to take right away in principle , you only object to take away those right that you wish to retain . that be quite inconsistent . where do you get the idea that one have a right to perform an abortion anyway ?	0

would this be consider intelligent design ? to me it would be like wind up a top , load it with paint , and then let it spin on paper to create a painting . the process be deliberately set in motion , but the paint itself be random and not deliberate . where the paint fall be not by design , even though the overall pattern would be . anyway , to answer the question , there be lot of people who believe in a creator as well as evlution , so the belief be not mutually exclusive . the problem be that christianity depend upon the account of genesis be true . spontaneous origin be mutually exclusive to genesis , but evolution by itself be not necessarily . but evolution pose other problem such as the age of the earth and the existence of dinosaur that creationists be stump by . in order to belief in evolution , you must , at the very least , disregard the genesis account . and disregard genesis automatically invalidate christianity . but it doesnt necessarily invalidate the existence of a creator . pretty wierd , huh ?	0

you believe that your interpretation of the christian bible be more correct than his , and he believe that his interpretation of the christian bible be more correct than yours . this be quite simple , but that ' s never really help you see the problem before . yeesh . even when i spell it out , he still can not keep it straight . no , marc , you be look at the wrong quote . try read what i write . yes , you can expect accusation of quote mining to be common when you commonly quote mine . say , do you think these two thing could possibly be relate ? `` concise and readable `` take a backseat to accurate . as i say , miller overemphasizes view outside the mainstream of atheism and try to paint all of atheism with the same brush . in fact , he pick a single atheist to spend three paragraph on , then move past his exaggerated claim . and with good reason . marc ' s impeccable reading comprehension strike again . marc think i be respond to a different point , despite the clear explanation of his `` citation about atheist use evolutionary finding to support their concept . `` i figure it ' s his late attempt at a dodge . ignorance and incomprehensible babbling have get old to him , apparently . consider atheist do not believe in the supernatural , there ' s nothing else leave . now tell me how your truism actually mean anything . lewontin do not say to forbid access to the bible or other text . you simply assume that he say that because you want to build as much of a strawman as you possibly can . see , if you have just quote lewontin instead of try to censor his word , maybe you would have understood . . then again , probably not . i keep forget that your persecution switch be fuse in the `` on `` position . yes , lewontin mention the new york time . the home furnish supplement of the new york time , in metaphoric comparison to the stage set of the honeymooner . but you do not have a problem with your blatant misrepresentation , do you ? no , no , anything to brainwash the kiddy and advance your delusion of massive conspiracy . if miller truly do understand lewontin ' s point , he do a pisspoor job of explain it . lewontin say to eliminate the irrational and employ the intellectual . frankly , i see nothing wrong with this ; why do you ? the best case you will ever be able to make regard lewontin ' s claim in this book be that he believe that a certain path to truth be the most effective . you claim that your path to truth be the most effective . once again , we have no reason to believe either one of you over the other base on these statement alone . which dawkins book that promote atheism ( and by atheism , i mean atheism , not evolution ) be require reading in public school ? cite specific instance and include evidence that the aclu reject the case . this come from the person who omit so much that i have to elaborate on and quote from the book multiple time ? no thanks , i ' d rather make fun of your whining and your incomprehensible comprehension . oh , you do not read the part where he distance himself from atheism ? the one where he explain that evolution be compatible with theism ? i guess you miss it . it be only , you know , the vast majority of the book . oh , good , i get to do this again ! they be not christian , just like judge jones be not a lutheran . ( your foot should still be in your mouth over that one , but you never learn . ) they be all phony , be not they , marc ? lucky for marc , he can accurately assess people ' s belief system without know the slight thing about their belief . but i have this `` power , `` too : marc be an atheist . sure , he say all this fundie christian stuff , but he ' s really an atheist . i know it in my heart because my own belief system , infallible and base upon the teaching of god himself , tell me so . i know , because i know christian , and marc ' s not a christian . he ' s just a big phony . and there you go . atheist . clearly , i have correctly label you , and you be nothing but a false teacher . pathetic , marc . absolutely , positively pathetic . in other word , marc have absolutely no resolution to this conundrum except to leave us with this oh - so - powerful exchange : marc [ about miller ] : `` he ' d think differently if he interpret the bible the same way i do . `` miller [ about marc ] : `` he ' d think differently if he interpret the bible the same way i do . `` ahem . marc [ about miller ] : `` he ' d think differently if he interpret the bible the same way i do . `` miller [ about marc ] : `` he ' d think differently if he interpret the bible the same way i do . `` yes , i ' d speculate that he do not have such trouble `` stomach `` priest . after all , he share their belief , and not those of preacher of other ( e . g . protestant ) sects , many of whom refuse to recognize catholicism as truly christian . keep on diggin ' , marc . i love help you reach new low .	1
when will it stop ? never . they will take every gun , every toy gun , disarm the law enforcment community , give us nerf baton so we do not actually hurt the criminal , and say that this kinder gentler way of do thing will help . in the meantime murder will go through the roof , like in australia , rape will escalate , break and enter will become common place , and cop will die by the minute . they will not only confiscate the gun , but then charge the owner of those gun for be terrorist . it will not end . in order to establish true dependency upon a government you must force the populous to rely completely on the government for every aspect of life include safety .	0

a soul have a conscience , it can be emotionally move from different state of be . this be how the bible can say one soul be move ; sadden ; joyous . etc . i think therefore i be . mean a soul be emotional and so it really have no body . the soul be what we ask the lord to preserve . 1 peter 1 [ 9 ] receive the end of your faith , even the salvation of your soul . hamburger do not have a soul , it be dead meat . people eat brain and all the piece of an animal . no soul . the soul be conscience . under some condition it can return , not after death or before a brain though . we know that to be impossible . fetus do not get emotional ; there be no mind to speak of . no soul there to trouble . if you ? re on a machine and a doctor determine your brain be dead , the soul be not there . the body could see hell or heaven and there be no emotional effect . no soul for that . read the bible . don ? t listen to fool ; you ? re a person with a soul . use it .	0

but i suppose the pope be go to hell here be a link to a website that have a brief list of translational fossil , there be gap but that could mean that we have yet to find those fossil , or we have find them but no one have make the link yet . you also keep state that evolution be theory , we all agree it be still a theory but it be the most plausible theory that fit the evidence find that evolution be the most likely mechanism to explain that we have lot of different specie , to condense it to the real basic just think of it as the ancestry of the specie . ( apology for condense the theory into those small sentence could be here forever explain evolution ) n . b evolution do not mention how life start , there be another scientific theory on the origin of life on earth , but i can not think of it at this moment . hunter it be really not good form on a message board when debate a subject to say someone be go to hell because they do not agree with your viewpoint , present your evidence why you believe that evolution be incorrect and we can have a proper debate .	1

really ? a lot of people say that every answer make more question . in some way we seem to know less now than we do at the time of newton , in that we be less certain . and newton ' s law deal with what happen in a vacuum with no resistance , not direct human experience at any rate , my point be that you can not see all the evidence as pile up support for ' science ' as ' science ' be mould to fit that evidence . not a criticism of science , btw .	0

so biology do not exist before the theory of evolution be formulate ?	1
you be distort my view . i certainly do not think that i be `` god `` or that everyone have to revolve around my standard . however , i do think that morality have to have a rational basis behind it . this be my particular rational basis . my moral code certainly be not my own invention but be base on the moral code which i have often hear express by others , as well as the moral code of the german philosopher kant ( often reference in secular moral discussion ) . most people from childhood be taught moral at least partly from the same point of view i use . after all , how often have you hear the phrase `` how would you like it if that happenned to you ? `` or something similar . that be essentially the same as my basis of morality . it seem to be very common . even many religion use a similar basic appoach - `` do unto others . `` . of course , we all differ enough in our psychology that we might have some difference in how we would expect to be treat by others . so , this approach that i present would not lead to the same result in all people . also , this approach depend on the capability of the person to see the big picture and to be able to fully see thing from the other person ' s point of view . since we be imperfect in these skill , it certainly help to have moral discussion , moral mentor , etc . who can enlighten us in various situation . it be not a perfect method but at least it be not arbitrary since it be base on reason . note that the famous german philosopher kant give a similar secular moral code in his categorical imperative : `` act only accord to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law `` . your view do not seem to be base on reason but on a blind trust in a religious authority that tell you that a particular set of rule be right and must not be question . for those of us who do not hold the same belief as you , those rule often seem quite arbitrary . sometimes some of the reason behind those rule be illucidated , often not . sometimes the rule be the same as those derive by secular reasoning , sometimes not . personally , i would prefer an imperfect moral code that at least be base on reason and be refineable to one that be immovable and base on arbitrary standard . on a last note , there certainly could be moral code that be base neither on religion nor on some version of the moral code which i have present . if so , i would be quite interested in hear them .	0

and these be psalm , which be just popular prayer rather than the word of god arn ' t they ? rather than go with the slightly bizarre ' well you be not king david be you . ' type response , i could see it be fairly reasonable that god ' know ' people who be bear . he might ' know of ' the various individual who be misscarried , die at birth or be abort but what exactly do he know in relation to them ? do our soul have their own personality completely seperate from our mortal one that be shape as much by our soul as gene and experience - or do god ' know ' them through the billion of other possible universe , i . e he know them from somewhere / when they do not die . but if that count then that mean our soul be spread out over an infinite number of copy of us . if so then surely the threat of hell be irrelevant , either we be doom because clearly some version of reality have us be evil ( i have see enough tv show to know that this be pratically 100 % certain . ) or the soul be something seperate from us and our action ?	0

you know , your comparison of those that fight to end segregation , to those that fight to enact gun ban and gun control law , be nothing more than a cheap and dirty tactic that do nothing to address the issue , and everything to suggest that break the law be alright if you be a politician or legislator . there ' s a very large difference between people like rosa park , and the mayor of philadelphia ; gun ownership be protect by the constitution , segregation wasn ' t . the fact that you be compare those who institute civil disobedience for good reason , to those who want to violate state law to pass their own law because they think they know good and have a right to do so , just show that you can not address the point at hand .	0

this bring up an interesting point , and that be that science be extremely limited . use your logic , person should not have believe in the fact that the earth be a round object float in space before it be prove scientifically , even though it be a fact then , as it be now . this fact be write about in scripture long before science `` prove `` it , just as the description of the hydrological system be describe in scripture long before scientist figure it out . this be where the evidence can be find for the validity of the bible . when you find scripture after scripture of historical fact and scientific reference that be find to be accurate , you should tend to take be seriously . the problem with science be its arrogance . it ' s inability to see that truth can be find in other area be a real handicap . add to that theory like evolution that disguise themselves as science , and you have a real problem . one do not stand on a train track with a train barrel down on them to `` prove `` they will die . this `` fact `` be usually take to be reliable , even though that person have not `` proven `` it to be true through experimentation . if you need scientific proof for everything you believe , you have a real problem . if this be the case , no legal decision on guilt or innocence could be render in a court room , since the decision be usually render base on the preponderance of the evidence relate to a crime that be commit in the past . we have the same problem with the origin of life and evolution of specie - macro change that supposedly occur in the past . as such , every availble form of investigation should be follow up on . this include metaphysical possibility . they can be investigate just as evolution be , buy the study of history , manuscript , archeological method and statistical and prophetic evidence . both scientist and creationists be talk about investigation to find truth , and to self limit your investigative technique be not only reckless , but might be a form of self delusion . require truth to conform to your standard , as scientist of the past do , can either cause great delay in find truth , or cause you to miss it entirely .	1

to a small extent , this happen already . oftentimes ( 21.3 % , u.s. ) , a woman decide to have and abortion because she can not afford a baby ( from here , source ) . this be in effect remove member of society who be non - productive ( baby produce virtually nothing useful until they mature by about 10 year ) . and poor family be less productive , since they be often on welfare . grant , this be a rather harsh perspective , but the effect be the same : in the u.s. , there be about ( 21.3 % x 1.31 million ) 280,000 less people every year who would have likely grow up in a poor home ( assume the child would not have be adopt ) . force contraception / abortion be see as an effective way of solve poverty in some part of the world . 	0

well . i do not think it ' s a light choice for anyone . ( although i ' d imagine , for someone who might be developmentally disabled , for example , it might not mean as much . and i suppose some may not care at all . ) i do not think it ' s a decision woman necessarily struggle over , either , however . nor should they . for many woman , the course of action that they need to take be quite clear . that be , whether or not someone ' should ' have a difficult time with this decision , i do not agree . and , i do not think woman ' s motivation in get abortion , or their personal behavior ito become pregnant be anyone else ' s concern . or even if they do have an abortion blithely . ( distinguish from policy about public health education . ) i just think people have to do what ' s right for them . find that or reach a decision - - well , people be different and have different life . they have different understanding of biology , different health issue , different relationship , different economic position , different religious view , or none at all . the circumstance around the pregnancy , different . i do not agree with the `` potentiality `` issue either . if someone be not there yet , they be not in existence , period . i think there ' s just an understandable human reaction to the beginning of life be take . it ' s not `` potential `` life . it ' s life all right . but there ' s no individual except in our imagination . to me , viability , sentience , the development of the nervous system and the brain , and the experience of pain in a fetus during the third trimester begin to mark the ethical boundary . but those , too , as indicator , be not absolute . and the woman come first . it ' s between her and her physician . it ' s not my job to judge whether she suffer appropriately enough or not . and i do not think anyone should have go through any demonstrative motion one way or the other for the anti - abortion camp . it ' s none of their business .	0

first , be you not force your belief on me when you lobby for , enact , and support a law that legalize an act that i see as murder ? second , force someone to believe as i do be in no way the essence of christianity . god give choice ( which be another debate ) to man . we must simply choose right or wrong . jesus want us to influence , not force . jesus say to his follower in matthew 5:14 - 16 , `` you be the light of the world . a city on a hill can not be hide . neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl . instead they put it on its stand , and it give light to everyone in the house . in the same way , let your light shine before men , that they may see your good deed and praise your father in heaven . `` if i truly believe in jesus as my lord and saviour ( and i do ) , then i must follow his command to influence ( not force ) the whole world . it do not do any good to only preach to the preach .	0

i know that not all people who be pro - life be woman - hating . i , too want to see abortion reduce to the bare minimum . i just disagree with most pro - lifer on how to accomplish that . my issue be with rocc ' s attitude in the post i be respond to . to summarize he / she say that your should not get pregnant and if you do - you just get to deal with it . there be absolutely no regard for an individual ' s situation , the attack be entirely focus on woman and it offer nothing that will help reduce abortion . rocc ' s statement be quite woman - hating , but no , it be not indicative of the pro - life side ' s feeling about woman . the only time i be compel to really think pro - lifer be anti - woman be when they have the `` pregnancy be a woman ' s due punishment for promiscuity `` attitude or demand that a woman die / put her health jeapardy or demand rape victim go through with pregnancy . if you can not see the woman in even those most extreme situation , then you clearly have zero regard for woman . i believe that abortion stand it best chance at be reduce by address the thing that lead to unplanned pregnancy and the reason woman choose to abort . to demonize woman and simply take away choice without address these thing will not reduce the number of unwanted pregnancy , or gauarantee responsible choice . it will lead desperate woman to desperate action , though ( i . e . , coat hanger ) .	0

yes , that ' s all true , and it make complete sense . but in do this , the court may have create a situation where plaintiff can argue that california be deny people the equal protection of the law , by allow some people to be marry to same - sex spouse and not allow other people to be so married . if that be the argument that the plaintiff make in their federal lawsuit , this could be interest . the court might have to interpret whether allow some people to be marry and not allow other people to be marry violate the equal protection clause of the 1 4 th amendment to the u.s. constitution . and then they might have to decide whether this mean that all same - sex couple must have the right to marry , because some of them can be legally marry . in other word , this situation may be an opportunity , because no one can argue that this be a case of apple and orange of same - sex couple be different from opposite - sex couple . now you have same - sex couple who be legally marry and same - sex couple who can not be legally marry in the same state , which can be argue to be denial of equal protection of the law . i do not know . it could be interesting . maybe thing will not play out this way . we will have to wait and see .	0

so the radiometric data stand : the earth , moon , and old meteorite be all 4 or so billion year old , not just a few thousand . change decay rate ? another creationist attempt to counter radiometric date that be incompatible with their young - earth religious position be to claim that decay rate be not constant , thereby throw a monkey wrench into the calculation . there be at least two problem with this argument . first , it be not at all clear how varying decay rate could result in multiple decay sequence all agree on the age of an object . remember , for example , the old exposed rock on earth , date use different parent radioisotope ? all five of the decay sequence ( rb - sr , pb - pb , u - pb , th - pb , and lu - hf ) cluster right around 3.7 billion year . if decay rate vary enough to throw off date by billion of year , why would they vary in exactly the way need to consistently produce the same result ? second , radioactive decay of nucleus be not comparable to chemical reaction . in chemistry , the rate at which chemical reaction proceeds can be alter in a number of way , such as by change the temperature , acidity , pressure , or reactant concentration . such change , however , have essentially no effect on nuclear decay . in fact , experimental attempt to alter decay rate have be make , but fail .	1

monty babble : again monty have show that he do not bother to learn what he be talk about before he speak . it be not true that science have `` find `` the mitochondrial eve , nor be it true that it show that one person can have all the dna necessary for all the variation in human population . both idea be ridiculous in the extreme . the mitochondrial ( note spell monty ) eve be a mathematical concept . if the estimate of the mutation rate of mitochondrial dna be correct , then she live about 200,000 year ago or so . and of course , the variation in human population be carry by the nuclear dna , not the mitochondrion . high school biology student know this . and , of course , recent analysis have show that every gene in the human genome have an average of 14 allele . since a single person can carry only two allele of any gene , monty ' s assertion become pure nonsense . hank say : really ? when and by whom ? i wasn ' t even aware that it be an hypothesis but simply a mathematical concept derive from the mutation rate of the mitochondrial dna . possibly the time have be adjust due to differ estimate of the mutatiion rate , but the concept be valid . here be some information . monty , i would recommend that you read the book suggest so that you might gain some understanding of what you be discuss . you continue to make yourself look foolish . river out of eden be a good , basic introduction to the main concept of evolutionary biology . for information on mitochondrial eve see what , if anything , be a mitochondrial eve ?	0

yes , it seem you never learn , so i have no hope of educate you , and absolutely no intention . since you ask nicely , the answer be `` supreme soveriegn authority `` , i . e . the fact that government be establish among men to secure their basic right - - i . e . they not leave to individual whim to respect or violate as each plea , in the model of classic anarchy . state be thus delegate by their people , with the power to to protect these right through law . i believe we have go over this before ; you do not understand it then , i doubt you will now . or ever . it ' s still true , however : ignorance be never disproof . if you form your own nation , you can name yourself the sovereign and construe the law however you choose ; however that ' s neither here nor there .	1

this be a pretty touchy issue , and i agree with the different point of view . most of them make sense . while i do not personally agree with abortion , i do not feel that i have the right to tell someone else what they should do . the way i see it , be that it ' s their body , their life , they be the one who will be affect by their decision . i do not have to like the choice someone else make , and i do not have to agree with it , but while i have that right , i also believe that people should have the right to make those decision . be these anti - abortion people go to step in and pay for the cost of have the baby , raise it , etc ? . maybe some of those be the issue people consider when have an abortion . maybe the woman be rap . i see the point when someone say that the baby should not be punish for that , and i agree with that , but the rape be commit against the woman ' s will . she do not ask for that to happen , and if a pregnancy result from that , that be also against her will , so why should she feel that she have to have the child ? what do she tell the child when it decide to ask who its father be ? the child could still be bear and give up for adoption , and that be a good idea , but maybe the woman will relive the rape throughout the pregnancy by be remind of it on a daily basis . all i feel be until it happen to you , and you be force to make these kind of choice , you should not judge anyone else for the choice that they make .	0

well , at some point they be sentient being ( surely you agree ) , that ' s the point that the fetus become a person in my opinion . before that it ' s not really too bad . i do not have a problem with people `` have sex in an improper way `` or choose to `` screw each other how they would like to screw each other `` . i do have a problem with people create a feeling be and then kill it , as be the case when fetuses become sentient and be abort . you also say that it be my opinion , which it be , but it be also your opinion . you have say that woman who have abortion because they arn ' t responsible be make bad decision . first off , it ' s not punishment , it ' s take responsibility for your action . i have address the men , this be what i be talk about , it be in my last post . be you really read the my post ? i say `` they ( men ) should have to raise the child also as they be equally to blame `` . if i could take some of the birth pain from woman and give it to mwn , i would . the bottom line be that woman know that if pregnancy occur their will be pain , yet some do not protect themselves against it . why would it then be my responsibility to take that pain into account ? they accept the risk when the do not try to protect against it . yeah , like the one that i address the men in , right ? i have never say that we should punish 12 year old orphan . show me where i say that . i say that the parent should help raise the child if they have the mean . would that put a slight damper on the 12 year old social life ? probably , but she will be an adult soon enough and she should take some responsibility for her action . the father should have to do the same . why do you admit that the action of the 25 year old be tragic but you do not want her to take responsibility ? how do be poor limit your responsibility to protect yourself ? i know a poor woman who have 10 kid just hop that one day she would find a man that would be willing to help raise the rest . also , what do you mean by `` less fortunate ? it never happen but she keep have kid after kid and hop it would . should she be excuse for her behavior because she be poor ? no , she keep go to bar look for good men . bad choice = bad outcome . do you think that this be proof that abortion be necessary ? nope , abortion be not the answer in case like this , only responsibility can solve the problem . the bad thing be that only one of the men do anything for the child and he do not do enough . she have never file for child support and the kid be almost never discipline . i do not want to do anything as far as law be concern . i would recommend that she and the father raise the child , but sadly that may not happen . i will just continue to have pity for all of the irresponsible `` lover `` out there .	1

to me , part of the point of the `` please , no scripture `` comment would be to forgo any insistence that we worship god just because the bible say to . a person could insist that son pay some form of homage / respect to their father on father ' s fay , but i would argue that it ' s not reasonable to do so in every case . for example , if the father be physically or sexually abusive , or the father abandon his child , those would be reason to fore - go any father ' s day formality . and `` god `` could be view as the absent father . suppose we assume that he create the earth and life on the earth . what ' s his involvement be since then ? should we worship him just because he ' s god ? or , depend upon how one see god , be god a be unworthy of worship and idolization ? and along those line , utilize the bible as a reference could be a double - edge sword . the `` god `` of the old testament order slavery , misogyny , genocide , woman as spoil of war , . 	0

the idea here be to demonstrate that the odds of them realize the same genesis be impossible . that be unless god come back again , speak his word into a book through the scribblings of random religious scholar . if you accept that this be inevitable , you be delusional . the most likely thing would be for human to come up with an entirely different religious doctrine . i would be willing to bet that it would pass through polytheism into monotheism as more information become available and eventually we would end up right where we be now . the problem with this scenario be that evolution would probably never be confirm since our biological history would not be apparent . we would come up with theory that god make us and perhaps even some screwball would say we be all part of an experiment and be place on the planet by our ancestor a couple hundred thousand year prior .	0
