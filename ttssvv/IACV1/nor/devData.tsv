as i mention above , science curriculum follow path . one ' s worldview play heavily on one ' s interpretation of scientific data . an agnostic , or atheist teach establishment can become satisfied with one path of scientific theory without search for others . there may be more to be discover about thermodynamics , cell structure , irreducible complexity , the decay rate of the earth ' s magnetic field , radiometric dating , the fossil record , and countless other thing that a teaching establishment may not be interested in explore , if it ' s comfortable with it ' s interpretation of current data ' s indication that the happenstance origins worldview be correct . it go back to what we touch on before - teaching student how to think , not what to think .	0
be you try to make a point here ? or be you just spew forth your hoplophobic tendency because you be get nothing well to do ? one of the problem with school child be that it ' s become a crime to discipline them the way our parent be discipline . there ' s no spanking , corner time , or sit on a chair with a dunce cap , because that ' s all be label as abuse to emotional development . instead we have counsel and the administration of powerful prescription drug to kid who can barely read . kid be spoil rotten and leave unsupervised with tv show and video game that glorify violence and murder people for fun . parent be stuck work two or more job just to make enough money for bill so they do not wind up on the street . we need massive reform . we get ta go back to how kid be raise in the 5 0 s .	0

and yet quantum physic tends to be very contradictory , at least to our perception . acausal event happen . a particle can be in two place at the same time . a particle can disappear and reappear in a different location without traverse that distance . and et cetera . since the beginning of our local universe occur at quantum level , i would be cautious about draw philosophical conclusion base on our macro - world experience .	0
why do people on the pro - gun side continuously try to oversimplify the issue ? no one be really argue that there would be zero murder without gun . the question be would there be less murder without gun . in developed nation with stricter gun law there be less murder . at any rate , i do not think you can draw such conclusion base on one incident .	0

yes . it describe an action without ascribe its form to its end result , outcome , whatever but strictly to a cause / s force / s in action . that be why ' selection ' be always teleological . in order to select or choose anything , an end must always be in view . there must always be a volitional discrimination of option base upon a criterion dictate by the desired end . the only time `` channel `` becomes teleological be when something live [ a human or a beaver , let us say ] intententionally do the channeling . but since it be understood that mechanical force can also ' channel ' , unintentional , out of simple mechanic , the word channel can not be call teleological . in the same way , ' sort ' can be consider non - teleological , hence mechanical , and thus suit to your glossary , because thing can be sort by mechanical force alone . but ' selection ' always require volition and awareness . so ' selection ' be always teleological .	0

well , thank you for this thread santafeur . i must say though that i peruse various thread just to read stuff . the c v . e topic do not strike a nerve with me . in fact , i also wonder what it be about the human mind that make people so desperate to want to know how we come about . what difference do it make ? we be here now . could we possibly just accept that we get here somehow , and just move on ?	0

i think i , and the other member of what i will call the `` scientific community `` , must be masochist of sort as well , we continually return to these thread and bang our head against mind that be stone wall - completely impervious to reason or logic . i think , no , i know , that there be two main reason why i return to these thread . the first one be simple , i be amaze at the scientific illiteracy of the average yec , especially when science be often their justification for belief . the second and major reason be simply my fascination with how the mind of the creationist work . their desperation to justify their faith be so powerful it drive them to completely abandon mainstream science and logic in favour of an isolated coccoon of reality . the insecurity in their faith that the entire pseudoscience of creationism betrays be the most ironic part . as you say , most quickly realize that they be in over their head , that what they have be tell in their church do not stand up to scrutiny in the real world . so , rather than continue down a path that will bring them no good , they retreat and bury their head in the comforting sand of `` not know any good `` . however , there always seem to be one or two that be so deeply entrenched , that they simply can not retreat , they have get too much invest . the psychology , more than the science , be fascinate to me . waxy	0

so a free society be one where the goverment do not have tab on their citizen ? how could then the goverment work when it do not know who they actually govern ? the foundation of economics be that you have correct data , else it ´ s the beginning of corruption not freedom . and since when be there a dichotomy between freedom and socialism ? further how do the usage of identification ease the round up of suspect ? wouldn ´ t it be rather more risk to be round up if you couldn ´ t identify yourself and thus automatically become suspect than be able to and take yourself out of the calculation ?	0

technically , all syllogism need two premise , first of all . `` step two `` and `` step three `` be a dilemma , not separate step . learn to read . dilemma : you only read scenario 1 , which be : step two - god can create a rock he can not lift - step three - god can not lift the rock conclusion - god be not all powerful scenario two be - god can not create such a rock - therefore , there be something god can not do - therefore , god be not all - powerful the only case in which god could truly be all - powerful be if he can somehow both create an unbreakable rock and then break it , which defy the law of non contradiction and be thus absurd . thus , the notion of all - powerfulness , which lead to such a notion , be also absurd .	0

so then the law be flaw because criminal could just as easily get their hand on select firearm , ban or no ban . you have just admit that the bill do nothing and thus there ' s no justification for it to be reinstate .	0
and it be not the job of the school to teach anyone about your god . that be the job of the parent . if it be a good idea to teach about your god in the public school , it be also a good idea to teach about mine . how about wicca and islam . a good idea , right ? but if some creationists do not like their child learn science , then they should put them in their own `` christian `` school where they can become scientific illiterate who think that heliocentrism be a fact .	1

first of all . excuse me for my english write - skill . be a norwegian citizen with free universal healthcare , it be pretty hard to understand why many of you american be so afraid of a little more govermental influence in the healtcare - business . everybody know that healthcare cost money . so why accept that a large ammount of your money be go right in the pocket of the insurancecompanies ? shouldn ´ t your money result in healthcare and not in profit for some greedy company ? to be honest i ´ m happy to be norwegian instead of american . when i get sick i can go to any hospital and get the best treatment available without have to worry about the cost . what ´ s wrong with that guy ? of course it come at a price . we probably pay high tax than you . but i do not pay for insurance , and bottom line i think most people be good off this way . at least i ´ m get healthcare for my money without support insurancecompanies that make a profit out of people health - issue . any comment ?	0

because self - defence , unlike most other ' reason ' , automatically allow all citizen firearm access , and in most case allow firearm ace without mandatory training / evaluation . when this occur , you be much more likely to get misuse of firearm . if you read around you will see that i consider all right as needing justification . this come both from my stance as a relativist and as a uk citizen , where there be no formalised constitution . ask yourself this - if a right can not be justify , why should it be treat as a ' right ' ?	0

well , all i can say then be that no action be just about as bad as failed action , and be as bad in term of anything current . either way you do not have gay marriage . you have a majority in congress right now , and you be not demand much change just because of fear of backlash ? yeah , there would be backlash . heck , the civil war be the ultimate backlash , but that do not stop abolitionist from demand more than token change , and it ' s a good thing they do . it ' s your gig , though , so do what you want . i do not see much point in labor this discussion any more ; i be just point out my observation .	0
no it do not , as abortion be a legal option in this case . this be not a legality issue , but an education issue .	0
well , here be my take on it . i really believe that only the truly evil end up in hell . those like hitler . i think that anyone else go to heaven - wiccan , atheist , buddhist , etc . - anyone who follow christ ' s message of love , tolerance , and acceptance , whether knowingly or not . those who preach hate , and those who act on that hate , like hitler , the k , and any other person / person fill with hate ( sad to say , this seem to apply to our own friend archie here ) be the one who will end up in hell .	0
oh i be so sure that ' s the case . `` well the economy ' s at the bad i have ever see and i do not have a job and can not possibly provide a living for my family and we be in danger of lose our house and living on the street , but i do not think i will save us all a lot of pain and agony because i do not have a gun meaning that it ' ll just be too much work to kill ourselves . `` yeah right , like a lack of have a gun would have keep this family from die in this instance . your comment cheapen the value of life .	1
fish to amphibian support evidence frmo here : fish / amphibian transition from primitive bony fish to amphibian : paleoniscoids again ( e . g . cheirolepis ) osteolepis - - one of the early crossopterygian lobe - finned fish , still share some character with the lungfish ( the other group of lobe - finned fish ) . have pair fin with a leg - like arrangement of bone , and have an early - amphibian - like skull and teeth . eusthenopteron ( and other rhipidistian crossopterygian fish ) - - intermediate between early crossopterygian fish and the early amphibian . skull very amphibian - like . strong amphibian - like backbone . fin very like early amphibian foot . icthyostegids ( such as icthyostega and icthyostegopsis ) - - terrestrial amphibian with many of eusthenopteron ' s fish feature ( e . g . , the fin ray of the tail be retain ) . some debate about whether icthyostega should be consider a fish or an amphibian ; it be an excellent transitional fossil . labyrinthodont ( e . g . , pholidogaster , pteroplax ) - - still have some icthyostegid feature , but have lose many of the fish feature ( e . g . , the fin ray be go , vertebrae be strong and interlocking , the nasal passage for air intake be well define . ) and while nothing be ever proven 100 % in science , the link between fish and amphibian be pretty conclusive . evidence for dino to bird evolution just keep mount and at present it be the best supported theory . just look at the recent discovery of an oviraptorosaurian dinosaur with 2 egg still in it ' s body , two very bird like egg . see here : dinoeggs so once again , while not proven 100 % , dino to bird evolution be the best supported theory . do you have anything that be well support ? 	0

actually , if you bother to pay any attention whatsoever , it actually go against your point entirely . just because wsm and i be both in `` heterosexual `` style relationship , do not change the fact that both of us be indeed homosexual and therefore prof that homosexual do indeed have child , plan or not . mine too be kind of a suprise . i be on the `` pill `` but be also take antibiotic at the time and for anyone who do not already know , antibiotic will completely cancel out the affect of the birth control pill . i be not aware of this at the time and low - and - behold i end up pregnant with my son . p . s . just for general information , i be not take `` the pill `` for birth control reason . not all woman who be prescribe it be even sexually active at all . the birth control pill contain synthetic or naturally dirived female hormone , which for some woman aid them in attain a more regular period . many woman atheletes be prescribed birth control because be extremely athletic can disrupt , postpone or completely do away with a woman ' s natural cycle . take birth control help to `` normalize `` female hormone level . such be my case .	0

you know what ? you be start to remind me an awful lot of reverend jackson and reverend phlaeger ( the one who say they be go to kill anyone that do not support their idea of gun control ) . the claimed that a gun shop owner be intentionally violate the law of chicago and sell all kind of weapon to gang member , simply by be one mile outside of the chicago city limit . your entire argument be that since there be firearm dealer within a certain distance to the mexico / america border , then they must obviously be outfit the mexican drug cartel . you have hang yourself with this article you just post , and i be gon na explain why . the atf have say there be 6,700 licensed dealer along the border , mean they know exactly where they be . so why exactly be not the atf go in there and break them up for their illegal activity ? after all if close proximity be an unquestionable sign of guilt , then the atf must know that these guy be equip mexican drug cartel with fully automatic machine gun ( the kind that the american people can not ever get ) and grenade and rocket launcher , and maybe even the odd nuclear warhead . the atf shut down red ' s trading shop on matter as insignificant as typo . so why be not they go in and shut down these rogue dealer if they be do anything wrong ? it ' s illegal to own an automatic weapon of any sort without a federal tax stamp , and it ' s not possible for civilian to own post - ' 86 model automatic weapon , so why be not the atf do something about it if they be break the law ? seriously aussie , what be it , be the atf say `` we know they be break the law , but they be not do anything illegal we can bust them on `` ?	1

as point out , with a different physic , chemistry and biology , the universe as we know it would not exist . what be really damaging to the concept of creationism as truth be a list of what we should expect if a flood have occur under the same law of science that be in operation today . one problem with creationism ( i know , you want to ignore the problem ) be that they constantly fall back on miracle in order to do a reset of reality in order to circumvent reality when creationism bump into scientifically impossible event . i do not mean to rain on the parade , but with all that say , it have be do . there be a list of 28 item , originally compile by jim moore , that we should find if the flood happen as per the bible . not even miracle can solve these . that list be follow by further problem that have be compile by ken harding from numerous source . what would we expect to find if the world have flood for more information you can refer to the flood geology faq at to . two item with information that specifically address the question of the op be problem with a global flood , and the geologic column and its implication for the flood .	0

well , i have hear people on the pro - gun side say that most defensive gun us do not involve fire even one round . so limit the capacity would probably have less of an effect on the ability to defend yourself than on crime . so why be people from the gun lobby always whine about restriction like this ? when semi - automatic rifle be ban in australia , hunter welcome the law . they saw it as a challenge because it take great skill to shoot an animal with a bolt action rifle . not so in america where some gun owner like to use gun that could take down plane to shoot small animal .	0

let me try explain this another way . accord to the logic present in the original article : gun owner : discrimination by gun control law : : serial rapist : discrimination by anti - rape law you see , it ' s the relationship that i be compare . that ' s what an analogy be . i be not compare the gun owner to the serial rapist , but rather the relationship between discrimination and gun owner as present in the original article and the relationship between discimination and serial rapist . what do you mean `` my ultimate agenda `` ? i want regulation of the gun trade as there be regulation of the trade of every product with specific control law that apply to each product . do this mean a complete ban ? no . let us compare this to a driver license . yes i realize that ' s not a product , but it be regulate similar to the way gun should be regulate . it vary from state to state , but there be typically a driver ' s ed class , drive with an instructor , and a driving test . a person must pass all of these thing before recieving a license . a person must also meet other qualification such as vision requirement . then , in my state , when a person recieves his or her license , it be only a provisional license , mean that he or she can not drive between midnight and 5 a . m . this last for eighteen month unless there be any move violation , in which case the period start over . these be all reasonable restriction . these idea can be apply to gun control . there could be gun training and gun test . background information such as prior criminal activity should be check . gun should not be make available at unregulated event such as gun show . these sort of regulation be also similar to those on prescription drug . a person must have a prescription from a real doctor , and he or she can only purchase or pick up the medicine from certified location . this be clearly not a fringe view since a large number of people support gun control . you may disagree with this view , but it clearly be not a fringe view . nor be it a sign of mental instability . the constitutionality of gun control be clearly debatable . it ' s not exactly simple . you can not ignore `` well regulate . `` even guncite , a pro gun website , say , `` ' to put in good order ' be the correct interpretation of well regulate , signify a well discipline , train , and function militia . `` disciplining , training . that sound like control . and if it be such a simple constitutional issue , why have not the supreme court make a difinitive ruling on it ? if anything , it have rule in favor of gun control , say in the miller case that `` the second amendment must be interpret and apply with a view to its purpose of render effective the militia . `` regardless , the constitutionality of a law do not make it wrong or right . slavery be once allow under the constitution , but that do not make it wrong or right . i never label your view as anarchistic . i say that unless you be an anarchist , you be not in support of complete , 100 % , absolute freedom . what objective mean be you use to determine that gun ownership be a basic civil right ? first you assume that since i have liberal view on this subject , i agree with the action of all other liberal , and second you assume that all other liberal commit the same action . i have not once mention `` saturday night special . `` my law be mean to target all gun crime and gun accident . should we not have law against gun crime ( not law against gun ) because most gun violence be minority on minority . sould we not have murder law because a disproportionate number of murder be commit by minority ?	1
you know , i would be fine with that as long as it be truly a middle ground . if that term be use equally among straight as well as gay . but it ' s just a term . the same as with the term `` marriage . `` it ' s just a term . just a word . personally i feel the government need to get out of the business of marriage altogether . let the legal term be agree upon unilaterally .	0

but then it also do not answer the question `` do anything exist `` , nor do it answer an infinite number of `` existence `` question . do `` troll `` exist , follow the same reasoning . if you find one , they be no longer a fairy tale / imaginary creature , they be some organic life form that can be measure , test , and quantify . i . e . no longer an imaginary creature . so they can no more be find than god . so replace god / troll with an infinite number of other imaginary thing and you will see why the question `` do god exist ? `` , have no real importance in the physical universe . ( do the tooth fairy exist , do a unicorn exist , do fly pig exist , etc . ) in fact , i like that statement . the existence of god be not imporant . rather - the faith in god ( s , etc . ) be what be `` important `` , and the thought most certainly exist in the physical world and have a measureable impact . i think that ' s why i do not mind so much `` religion `` per se , it ' s the human condition that bring suffering , and uncertainty , into our life and for some people , the feeling bring about by their faith seem to treat the condition . ( the human condition also bring joy , love , etc . , but i ' d like that without the pain personally ) i only mind it when thing in the physical universe be `` attacked `` with the premise of belief in god ( s ) , which be a waste of human energy . we have a limited time , do not spend it use fallacy to undermine those who be actually try to build on the foundation of human knowledge . and any belief in something without evidence scare me if it become a driving force behind decision . . she ' s a witch because she make the crop die . she must be burn . . he break `` god ' s `` law and therefore must be guilty . . this be `` god ' s `` war . yeah , that still scar me . that ' s why i think , at least in the us , the seperation of church and state be so ridiculously important , and accept . while there be fundamentalist that rail against it . it ' s hopefully obvious that with ~ 80 % of the us believe in an imaginary `` god `` , but also have a separation of church and state and the most generally advanced scienctific community in the world , then the two can obviously co - exist , and i ' d go so far as to say thrive as long as the line be draw and not cross . i learn something in respond , thanks for the spark . - mach	0

i would say that the soul be that part of us that be immortal . it be our essence . our personality may impact or be impact by it , but i would say it be far more . indeed , i would say it be what psychologists call emergent downward causality . as for the role of god , science have not disproven any of it . science have explain how thing occur but that do not eliminate the possibility of god nor do it limit what god do . we would simply not be understand god fit in the science of it . that make sense give that god be consider infinite and we be finite . i think the soul be what give us the possibility of even imagine the infinite . the idea that we can see beyond what we be or even to conceptualize such thing give a clue that there be more to us than meet the eye . i do not see why god and science can not coexist . even evolution and creation . forget planting evidence . that be too far fetched . i would rather think that it be more likely that what god say actually fit the evidence even though we can not understand it . i do not know about god or `` not god `` ( if you will ) but if there be a god then the idea that he be beyond what i can actually conceive and yet completely conceivable make sense for that kind of be . it should be an apparent paradox to me . if it be not , then my concept of god be far r to small to be of any use to anyone . huck .	0

no . we do not agree . for one thing your faith be not a theory . creation as describe in genesis be a myth , in fact , two myth . furthermore , a scientific theory do not mean `` wild guess with no foundation `` . that seem to be what you want the word to mean . in science a theory be an explanation for observed fact that have be test . you see , a theory be predictive . i will give you some example of scientific theory . the germ theory of disease , the theory of gravitation , the heliocentric theory , tectonic theory , atomic theory . moreover , you be wrong that science can not observe actual evolution of life . it be do all the time . while it may be debatable that a virus be alive , the recent case of sars make the jump from civet to human after a mutation be evolution .	0

so now you be say that the earth do not move ? i get it . the earth use to be fix at the center of the universe when those bible verse be write but god change it . now it orbit the sun like the other planet . actually , the verse do say that grasshopper have four leg . there be no mention of jump leg . you supply that because it be foolish to claim otherwise . that ' s what i mean when i say that you reject part of the bible that you see as foolish . when you have accept the evidence that the bible be in error ( 4 leg on a grasshopper , sun at center of solar system , rabbit chew cud , an unmoving earth ) you add element that be not in the bible and declare it without error . you `` interpret `` and then claim that you be read it literally . pick one and go with it . you seem to claim that you accept the bible literally and then add whatever you feel be necessary to make it rational .	1
you ask others for their opinion , and then refuse to listen when it ' s offer . the truth be that you do not see the analogy as valid . we do . we see a situation where , like black before , people disapprove of a group of people and want to segregate one group from the other . sometimes , they refuse to offer any alternative . sometimes , they offer a separate alternative . that argument cut both way . the question come up regard what ' s your beef on the issue ? why be you so insistent on maintain two separate group ? be it because you want to reserve marriage as `` prestigous `` whereby gay be keep out ? under interracial marriage , no black person be prohibit from marry either . should people have be satisfy with interracial couple be classify as `` civil union `` ? today , we recognize that racism be wrong . yet some people still persist with homophobia . they fail to have a historical context on the real meaning of the methodology they recommend . frankly , that ' s like say `` you can not be jewish , but you can pick any sect of christianity you want to . you can not wear a star of david , but you can wear a cross . so that ' s equal `` . you be say we can marry heterosexually , so homosexual must pretend that ' s equal ? make no sense . if i call somebody `` male `` , that restrict no right from them . it do not require they go to a separate place to get their right . and quite frankly , insist on keep one definition for a right ( at the exclusion of gay ) be `` satisfy the ego `` of the homophobic group . `` attack on the definition of marriage `` ? why be it an `` attack `` to include gay couple in as married ? would it be an `` attack `` on something for black to not have to be segregate from white ?	1
yes , because although we trust our military with anti tank missile , . 50 machine gun , artillery , fighter plane , cruise missile and even nuclear weapon , god know you would not want them parade around in public with a glock under their jacket unless they have renew their permit in person . i would have think that people would have learn their lesson from the federal assault weapon ban . it be expensive to enforce , a major sore spot for a fairly large percentage of the population , and have no real positive effect , mainly due to the fact that it address no identifiable problem . you expect such thing from a liberal stronghold like california , a state with high crime that be always on the verge of bankruptcy , out of control labor cost , where they can not even keep the power on all the time becuase their environmental regulation be so rediculously stringent that the fiscal reality of build new powerplants be soo terrible that nobody would even consider it . i thought people be more intelligent in your new state , george .	1

so where in there do behe say that brute luck be actually impossible ? nowhere . where in there do behe say that brute luck can be absolutely and definitively rule out , 100 % . nowhere . as i originally say , “ we can find such an explanation wanting or unsatisfying , but be highly unlikely be not the same as prove it could not happen . ” this be quite in line with behe ' s statement in his book . further , prove it impossible be what you would have have to have do to prove that evolution be false . behe say it can not be prove impossible : that it can not be completely refute . ( and quite frankly , most of us would agree that claim that an ic system - or multiple ic system - arose by multiple simultaneous mutation be in no way comparable to claim that “ the word luckily pop into existence yesterday with all the feature it now have . ” behe ' s not be fully honest here . ) what i quote behe say be exactly what he say and be his position on the matter . i have not misrepresent behe ' s position on this . now , a charge of wrongdoing be discard unless the party make the accusation can fully support his charge : burden of proof fall upon the accuser , not the accuse . you have fail to support your charge , so i prevail . now , if you want to continue push your charge of wrongdoing on my part , you need to show where , in behe ' s “ darwin ' s black box ” , he go on to show that brute luck be actually impossible : where behe show that brute luck can be absolutely and definitively rule out , 100 % . until you do , you have fail to rebut my counter to your statement , and , i be also clear of your false charge . p : the only one play around with context here be you ! the context of my statement be that you claim to have proven evolution false , and i point out that : ( 1 ) in order for you to have succeed , one of several thing you would have to do ( but do not ) be to disprove multiple , simultaneous mutation ( brute luck ) and ( 2 ) behe himself say that multiple , simultaneous mutation can not be absolutely rule out . try to keep the context , okay .	0

i be not argue that gun control will change the nature of men - though gun may make them more willing and confident to engage in crime . with guns criminal can do even more damage . add gun to crime be like add gasoline to a fire - it make an already exist problem worse . if you think that just as many people die from stab and beating in other developed nation as people die from gun in the us then you need to do more research .	0
so , which be it ? you do not want violator of federal law to have gun , yet you do not want them to get rid of them either . can not possibly do both , now can you ? which one ? do the law breaker keep them , or not ? make it against the law to keep the gun . now make it against the law to sell them . duh ! i guess we will just hang out in limbo - land !	1

state - level government be largely worthless , in my opinion . it be complete absurdity to allow constitution to be ammended base on the vote of the people . people as a whole be largely bias , uninformed , and care only about the wellbeing of the majority , persecute the minority any chance they get . simply put , the will of the people be too often to benefit the majority and persecute the minority , and this can be see everywhere throughout history . the will of the people often deserve to be not only ignore but put in a little can and crush , for the voice of the people be not the voice of the people at all ; it be the voice of the majority . i can not know the intention of the creator of the california goverment when they create their judicial system , but if it be anything like the intention of the founder of our nation , then the judge be do precisely what it be intend to do : judge law which persecute the minority , assure that the government can not engage in such persecution without a whole lot of effort and not have to fear retaliation . if the point of judge be simply to give in to whatever pesecution 51 % of the population wish to force upon the other 49 % , then our government would be tyrannical in no time . you may feel that a bad precedent be set , but i consider it a far bad precedent for a judge to have give into the majority , to ignore what he feel be a destruction of freedom and equality , simply because it be popular to do so . i would also recommend that the california constitution be judge base on the fact that it likely have conflict statement , for example , it may state that everyone must recieve equal protection under the law , of which this be a clear denial . the california judge would probably not have the authority to refer to the federal constitution ; it would have to be take to the federal court for that .	0
and if one accept that gay citizen have equal right under that constitution , then one have to accept that a ban on gay marriage be intrinsically unconstitutional .	1
( note the key word `` also , `` which admit that it ' s human ) . as for the rest , this be more of the sort of `` defensive rationalization `` i talk about early , i . e . when people find it more reward to self - righteously defend their wrongdoing and thus shirk their responsibility to others , than to shoulder the burden to those they have harm , and thus they act in self - absorb narcissism and sociopathic dissociation , while likewise wax arrogant in self - deceive affirmation of their own `` brilliance `` and other superiority to do as they please , by simply deny say consequence however obvious - - illustrate here , by simply call a fetus a `` parasite `` and thus daintily strut off away from one ' s obvious duty to it , despite admit it ' s also human . however , a human be force into dependency on another for its life , be not a `` parasite , `` but a victim , and thus have the right to aid from the one responsible for that dependency . since you have admit that it ' s human , then the remainder be plain ; it also have the right to aid from the one responsible for its dependency , i . e . the man and woman in question who proximately cause it to be in its dependent situation through their willful action in full knowledge of that risk . here , the doctrine of strict liability would apply , in that normal sexual contact carry the inherent risk of pregnancy . this doctrine already apply to men , and should likewise apply to woman who choose to abort in spite of their responsibility to the prenatal human in question , create and make dependent on her for its life through her intentional action .	0
well , the short version be that shortly after the big bang , the universe be fill by a hot quark plasma . as it expand and cool , the process of nucleosynthesis produce the primordial elemental abundance , primarily hydrogen , with some deutirium , helium , and lithium . the physic be well understood , and verify by observation . quantify uncertainty in primordial nucleosynthesis without monte carlo simulation at roughly a billion year of age , star and galaxy form , some fraction of the star that form be massive supergiant , that burn up their hydrogen into other element , up to the atomic number of iron . this occur at a tremendous rate and in a few more billion year , these star go supernova and explode . prior to go supernova , these star go through a phase where the outer layer of the star be shed , provide way to transport the light element away from the star . you can see this in the following link : hubble chemically analyze the ring around supernova 1 9 8 7 a the trememdous radiation of the supernova permit the formation of element with atomic number higher than iron . the force of these explosion scatter the newly create element , create vast gas and dust cloud . eventually , the shockwave of another explosion initiate the collapse of one of these cloud , and the spinning hydrogen cloud begin to heat , eventually initiate nuclear fusion , and become our sun . as the sun begin to increase it ' s heat output , the volatile remains of the accretion disk be drive away from the inner portion of the solar system , leave mostly heavy elments . comet bombard the inner solar system , transport water , carbon , and amino acid to the newly forming earth , make dirt . in short , a truely wonderful creation .	1
f - - k ' in a ! right ! i do not want some damn man decide what ' s go to be legal for my body . they have no experience with the female anatomy except what they manage to bag , they should not be allow to decide for us . they have no idea what pregnancy be like , the damage it do to our body and our mind , and they do not have to pay to support a child that we be force to accept at knifepoint . where be the logic be violate woman a second time ? where ' s the justification for it ? do not the life of the unintended mother account for anything at all ? do you men have any idea of the dangerous precdent you ' d be set up with a total ban on abortion ? woman who have be rap and essentially tell `` you will have this child , you will carry it to term , or you will go to prison ! `` would likely commit suicide as a result , meaning that two life be gon na be lose .	1

well , if you do not want a reaction , i would prefer if you not use the word `` god `` since it be load with so many other meaning and conotations than those you say you mean . the choice between our two stance be indeed one between choose a moral stance base on reasoned analysis ( imperfect as that may be ) and choose a moral stance base on blind faith ( i . e . not support by evidence ) in a moral code dictate by a religious authority . you say that my moral code be a code that put faith only in myself . that be not true . i very openly acknowledge that if i never have input from the outside - moral code which be present to me with the reason behind them - then my moral code as determine solely by myself would have be meager indeed . i have have a wide range of influence which have help determine my moral code : - the moral code of my folk during my upbringing - the moral code of the moderate form of roman catholicism i grow up with - the moral code generally accept by the moderate democratic part of society - the moral stance of friend - the moral philosophy of kant and other philosopher i have read about i be sure that i could even come up with more than that . from all of those , i have glean a morality that work best for me , where my moral code seem to be quite a common one . the moral rule which i accept be typically the one which give the reason behind them and whose base assumption i agree with . the moral rule which i reject be typically the one which give no support reason or whose base assumption i disagree with . i suspect that you assume that if a morality be not ground in religious rule , then it become base on selfishness . that be not true . we be all inspire by hero that sacrifice themselves for others - be they secular or religious ( as jesus himself can be view as a hero ) . there be a lot of overlap in morality between secular morality and religious ( mainly christian ) morality - against theft , murder , etc . however , i find too many of the religious rule very arbitrary ( such as the anti - gay propaganda , some religion ' s ban on contraceptive , the idea of the infalibility of the pope , etc . ) that i certainly will not follow religious rule blindly . furthermore , so much of religious morality be determine simply by religious men who be set in the local morality of their time and attach that morality to the religion . even if jesus be divine , it would be very hard today to know how to throw away all the junk morality that be add after his time and extract the pure origin .	0
you seriously need to take a basic biology course so you can stop stick your foot in your mouth an egg be not larva , and larva be not a caterpillar , and a caterpillar be not a butterfly - much the same as a zygote be not a embryo , and a embryo be not a fetus , and a fetus be not a baby , and a baby be not an adult . i challenge you to prove that a larva be exactly the same as a butterfly . if you can not even do something as simple as that , then you will never understand the process / transformation of what a human have to go through , and that in and of itself should give you a clue as to how much in denial you be in , and how much you have to twist the truth around just to justify your version of event . deal with it !	0

gene transfer horizontally be as subject to selection as anyother form of gene . once intergrated into the recieving genome they be simply one more heritable element and if they alter the phenotype ( many be either neutral or even inactivatee ) then of course they be subject to selection . why do you think otherwise ? remember that horizontal transfer be a rare event roughly on a par with ordinary mutation .	0

well , the slavery analogy for gay right be past it ' s applicability at this point - - one be a property issue ( also root in deep prejudice ) , the other be a morality issue . many people oppose gay marriage out of morality and not prejudice . the same can not be say for slavery . there be many way that the analogy do not work and that ' s just one of them . in fact , it could as easily be an analogy to reverse it and say that the one who do the enslaving be analogous to gay right lobbyist and the abolitionist be analogous to those who seek to protect marriage . after all , the plantation owner be the one really fight for ill - conceive right - - right that they should not have have .	0

i see . then what you be claim be that creationists be the one who should define the vocabulary to be use by evolutionary biologist . would it then be ok for atheist to define the vocabulary of christianity ?	1
cornell ' s writing consistently place him within the collective right camp . even the argument that be attribute to him which start this thread show his collective right desire . his claim to neutrality in the individual / collective right debate be as disingenuous as his interpretation of the scotus opinion in both miller and cruikshank : great threat to second amendment ? great threat to second amendment ? whether ? neutral ? or not , cornell have prove himself capable of distort scotus opinion when he do not find that they suit his collective right taste .	0
so you yourself could have go gay but choose to be attract to woman ?	1

actually there be already a couple float around . one fascinate one : gaia theory and the daisyworld model . it ' s all around self - organise system and the earth as a self - regulating system / organsism / something or other . james lovelock and co . interest to read but sometimes feel a little too ' let - all - just - get - along ' to be real , hard - core theory . either way , it ' s probably a lot more likely to be accept than creationism , should evolutionism for some reason be disprove .	0
actually just as many atheist help the needy . of course a person would need to be open - mind to realize it . here be one such atheist charity . if you be open - mind about such thing then you would have learn that both bill gate and warren buffett , who have each individually make the two large charitable donation in american history , be both atheist ( oops , bet that ' s get ta kill your argument , huh ? ) and they can rightly claim credit for spur many other ultra - rich to also be charitable . ted turner , the multi - billionaire , have also donate million to others , and guess what grizzly6626 , he ' s an atheist too ! george soros , also a multi - billionaire , financier and philanthropist , have also donate million and be also an atheist . the list go on and on . you just do not hear about these people donate because they tend to do these thing quietly , and not with a lot of cough religious cough fanfare . do not mean to wake you up grizzly6626 btw - many catholic charity be know to turn the needy away . i have hear many account about how when some people first get marry back in the 1 9 7 0 s , that catholic charity would not help them out because they be not `` good , church - go catholic . `` basically because they do not go to church every week ( and put in their money fill envelope ) the church do not consider them worthy of help . you see , it be not because religion make people morally good than atheism . rather , it would be because church often organize charitable activity and encourage their member to participate , while atheist , simply have no comparable social structure . it ' s not that churchgoer have a superior moral sentiment , just that because of their increase social structure they naturally have increase opportunity . there be countless amount of people who be atheist that donate from the heart . they do not ' band together ' into group like religion do , and they do not advertise their charitable work like religion do , but they donate from the heart just the same . here be a partial list of many such individual who just happen to also be atheist . but it go much far than that though . there be a few organization form by atheist for the sole purpose of donate to those in need . one such organization be call s.h.a.r.e . - secular humanist aid and relief effort . here be a recent story about them help those in need . so , when someone ignorant and close - mind like grizzly6626 try to convince you that ' only religion ' donate or help those in need , you will now know that it ' s simply not true , and that people from all belief , even those that do not believe in god , help others in need and donate from their heart , because they know it ' s the right thing to do for their fellow man in need	0
he wasn ' t discuss abortion nor be he promote it . he be declare war on an unclean people whom he command the jew to wipe out in a time of war . again you rip an event out of context and attempt to imply god be endorse abortion .	1

what quaint illogic . only people who marry can get divorce , so a reduction in people marry have no effect on rise divorce rate . if anything , a rise divorce rate among few marriage point to an even high divorce rate than `` normal `` .	1
congratulation . you be now part of a minority group . marriage tend to either work or it do not . i know , brilliant observation . what i mean be either the couple be together for decade or spend x amount of year be unhappy until the unhappy be more than the baggage of divorce .	0
uh . no they do not . have you ever actually take a biology course ?	0
actually , that story be an invention after the fact . it never happen . at least that be what the witness who be there say . why do christian feel that it be ok to invent such story to support their point ? be not that lie ? be not lie wrong ?	0

i be not say we get it all right	0
well i # # # # , moan , and bitch about it to and i know i can not prove anything , but do ' nt logic say an ak47 assault rifle not semi auto but the real deal be go to cost hundred less south of their border , know doubt the same for an m16 . also you do not have to worry about smuggle them in as much if at all . besides it get hard all the time to get your assault rifle ( you know the full auto type ) not to mention hand grenade and rpgs at your corner gun shop anymore . oh yeah less not forget the gun show , and all there loop hole . jus a thought .	0
you be finally catch on . this be why we go to war against folk like saddam regard wmd , or declare sanction against syria and iran , but we do not go to war with the french or the british over wmd ' s . wmd ' s be inanimate object , and we all know that inanimate object be incapable of wag war . we also know that instable government and tyrannical leader be fully capable of wag war , and have do so in the past . it be good to see some of the gg ' s finally come over to the side of comon sense !	1
a lot of work have be do on that topic . i would recommend read debate design from darwin to dna it be a monster of a book , but it be definitely worth the read .	0
not necessarily . when `` life `` begin be irrelevant , because flower and weed do not have right yet they be a life form . the thing that determine right be intelligence . not how much or how little , but whether someone have it at all . a spec of dirt have no intelligence . it will not pop up and say `` hey ! how ya doin ! `` unless you be on crack . we have actually kill intelligent entity for less than the consequence of carry out an unwanted pregnancy . we hunt , and we go to war . even though i do not agree with war , i do agree with hunting , and i myself hunt on occasion . however , that be off topic . the point be , carry out an unwanted pregnancy can have devastating effect , and those next 18 year could hold her back from her life . its awful how she will have to liver her life . if she get an abortion , the embryo do not ( to quote another opinion ) `` mentally exist `` . now , hunt be really only do for recreation , and maybe a good meal . they would have be almost just as well off if they go to the local taco bell . sure , they ' d prefer hunting , but its really only do for fun and exercise . i , myself , value an animal over an embryo at its current stage . the only reason i do not completely think an animal be worth more be because that embryo have a chance of become a human . then again , the animal do mentally exist and have full awareness , and the embryo be really just a sit cellular watersack with no organ .	1
so you deny that this man be a victim ? realize that the gunshot draw attention , and attention be something criminal do not want . maybe without that gunshot , the guy would have be beat to death . but i suppose you ' d be happy , because at least the old man wasn ' t a gun owner . or i suppose you think he should have let the criminal have the money ; all that be need for evil to triumph be for good men to do nothing .	1

* * back to the dark side , eh , and ' argument by personal attack upon the character of your opponent ' ?	1
proof that evolution be `` right `` be not necessary to prove that genesis be not science . genesis be an inspired poem , and contain truth in its message , but it be pretty obviously a work of poetry , like a song . look at the repetition , and all the metaphor ! poetry do not imply fiction . there be many historically valid poem . plus , when read figuratively , genesis pose no conflict at all with science . evolution be not the only science that demonstrate genesis can not be read literally . what about the speed of light from the star , geology , genetics , comparative embryology , etc . the only stumble block between science and faith be a strictly literal interpretation . for most of us faith and science work together ! see : songofgenesis . org for more detailed information .	0
i be not sure what the source of the bias would be . do you mean that it be somehow prejudicial to link id with creationism , because , somehow id be scientific while creationism be not ? but that ' s just not true . in the dover case the court conclude that id be not science any more than creationism be . in fact , it be clearly demonstrate that the motivation for id be an effort to disguise the fact that it be nothing more than creationism without the mention of god . basically , if you scratch an ider , you get a creationist .	0
the subject matter would be life form . the unit would depend on which particular aspect you be study for instance to the question ' what unit of measurement would you use for the effect of evolution ? i would say genetic change that have pattern . id would have that and more .	0

i think you fail to take into account that for most opposer of abortion , they genuinely feel they be try to save life by their opposition . in many case it ' s not a matter of try control sexual prermissiveness in society but prevent life from be kill . disagree or not , you can not separate the anti - abortion message from the fact that it hold to the view that abortion be a form of murder .	0

so , whether the embryo / fetus / whatever - you - want - to - call - it have right seem to be a non - issue . because , for pro - choice folk , even if it have right , it still be preferable to ensure that it can be legally kill . of course , it be obvious to everyone that an entity do not need right in order to have legal protection . but i will let that slide for now .	1
