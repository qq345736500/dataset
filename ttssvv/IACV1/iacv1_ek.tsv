monty babbles : again monty has shown that he does not bother to learn what he is talking about before he speaks . it is not true that science has " found " the mitochondrial eve , nor is it true that it shows that one person can have all the <allcaps> dna </allcaps> necessary for all the variation in human population . both ideas are ridiculous in the extreme . the mitochondrial ( note spelling monty ) eve is a mathematical concept . if the estimates of the mutation rate of mitochondrial <allcaps> dna </allcaps> are correct , then she lived about 200,000 years ago or so . and of course , the variation in human populations is carried by the nuclear <allcaps> dna </allcaps> , not the mitochondria . high school biology students know this . and , of course , recent analysis has shown that every gene in the human genome has an average of 14 alleles . since a single person can carry only two alleles of any gene , monty ' s assertion becomes pure nonsense . hank says : really ? when and by whom ? i wasn ' t even aware that it was an hypothesis but simply a mathematical concept derived from the mutation rate of the mitochondrial <allcaps> dna </allcaps> . possibly the time has been adjusted due to differing estimates of the mutatiion rate , but the concept is valid . here is some information . monty , i would recommend that you read the books suggested so that you might gain some understanding of what you are discussing . you continue to make yourself look foolish . river out of eden is a good , basic introduction to the main concepts of evolutionary biology . for information on mitochondrial eve see what , if anything , is a mitochondrial eve ?	0

you ask others for their opinion , and then refuse to listen when it ' s offered . the truth is that you do not see the analogy as valid . we do . we see a situation where , like blacks before , people disapprove of a group of people and want to segregate one group from the other . sometimes , they refuse to offer any alternative . sometimes , they offer a separate alternative . that argument cuts both ways . the question comes up regarding what ' s <allcaps> your </allcaps> beef on the issue ? why are you so insistent on maintaining two separate groups ? is it because you want to reserve marriage as " prestigous " whereby gays are kept out ? under interracial marriage , no black person was prohibited from marrying either . should people have been satisfied with interracial couples being classified as " civil unions " ? today , we recognize that racism is wrong . yet some people still persist with homophobia . they fail to have a historical context on the real meaning of the methodology they recommend . frankly , that ' s like saying " you can not be jewish , but you can pick any sect of christianity you want to . you can not wear a star of david , but you can wear a cross . so that ' s equal <emphasis> " . <repeated> you are saying we can marry <allcaps> heterosexually </allcaps> , so <allcaps> homosexuals </allcaps> must pretend that ' s equal ? <repeated> makes no sense . <repeated> if i call somebody " male " , that restricts no rights from them . it does not require they go to a separate place to get their rights . and quite frankly , insisting on keeping one definition <allcaps> for a right </allcaps> ( at the exclusion of gays ) is " satisfying the ego " of the homophobic group .

so your claim is that the laws of physics have changed ? you see , it is not a matter of design . it is a matter of the physical limits of wood . wood is flexable , and the longer the piece of wood , the more bend there is in it . possibly you have seen a roof with wood supports that spans a large area . to do it requires huge trusses unless you add column supports . and i will bet there are not any spans of over 300 ft . where only a wood truss is used . for a ship / barge the problem becomes worse . if you make the keel thick in an effort to reduce the hogging and snaking , you reduct the room available inside . even at that , it would be impossible to eliminate all of the flexing and that flexing would spring the planks of the hull . there is no calking that has been devised that can fill an ever changing gap between planks . and , of course , recourse to a miracle is the standard creationist answer when faced with evidence that their mythology is not historic .

because his , as a christian , does not follow the christian bible to anywhere near the extent that mine does . " quote mine " - looks like that will be a common acusation here . if i keep things concise and readable , i am quote mining . that quote wasn ' t about atheists using evolutionary findings to support their concepts , it was about atheists being comfortable with theistic evolution , far more than " believers " ( creationists ) and that did not have a thing to do with my point . again , it was irrelevent to my point . atheists believe the only source of truth is secular - it goes without saying . no , lewontin did not say to give people the power to discover the truth , he ' s saying to give elites like him the authority to point them to " correct " sources of truth . read note <hashtag> 47 </hashtag> for chapter 6 . miller did not misinterpret him at all . in note <hashtag> 47 </hashtag> , lewontin even mentioned the ny times ! because there are no <allcaps> aclu </allcaps> lawsuits when dawkin ' s book is required reading in public schools . we have to more and more , as atheism is established . it ' s a deal , if you will put a hold on lecturing me about reading comprension as you ignore very relevant notes in the rear of the book . the one where he bragged about defeating henry morris , a christian ? ( pp 172 , 173 ) sure they were , christians are always opposing christianity ! all they have to do is claim to be a christian , and there ' s no way they could be a false teacher ! and that ' s all irrelevent , because pages 240 - 243 concern what happens in the world today , not what happened concerning creation . his feelings about god ' s interactions with the world today would be different if he had a basic knowledge of the bible . even though the bible says god did . his understanding of the bible is very undeveloped and limited . so you are implying that when he made his snide little comment about " preachers " , he wasn ' t referring to priests ? i have seen it all now . as i said , i hope to learn if all theistic evolution does not believe in original sin . i ' d like to know if all catholics believe the creation story is nothing but a fairy tale .	1

really ? i have argued that god is an epic liar ? can you point out me arguing that at all you <allcaps> epic liar </allcaps> ? once again you are interpreting what i have said through that sick and unbalanced mind of yours , and then extrapolating that i am now arguing in favor of calling my god an <allcaps> epic liar </allcaps> . is it absolutely impossible for you to debate issues while actually responding to what we really say rather than reading into what we say and redefining it to fit your warped and perverse perspective ? i mean , how sick and disturbed must your powers of reason and logic be for you to interpret my argument that man , because of our linear view of time , is misreading the fact that god placed the stars in space at the same time much more recently than it appears to us to have occurred , that god is then an epic liar ? is god responsible for how we interpret the evidence when we attempt to do it apart from placing him first and foremost into the equation ? is he the liar ? or are you who think like that deceiving yourselves by ignoring his place in the creation of time and space ? it is just completely beyond you to think from an honest and objective perspective , is not it obvious child ! but for a more practical answer , imagine this . in the beginning , space was a void which spanned all of eternity . only one object / energy source encompassed all of it from one end of its massive emptiness to the other , and that person was my god yahweh . and in one second or minutes time , he spoke all of the stars that have ever existed , at different intensities and strengths , which causes them to burn out at different times . but he placed them at the very inner and outer limits of time and space at that time . liken it to a farmer with a hand full of seeds . he pulls back his arm and throws those seeds to the end of the plot of land he is sowing at that time . to the ants on the ground , if they measured the time it would take to reach the farthest seed , it would represent a great distance , but to the farmer it was just one arms throw in time to disperse hundreds of seeds at one time . now here we are as finite creatures who can only see time from our linear perspective . time is plastic . our linear measure is man made for our convenience only . that you place what we call the measure of so called light years is arbitrary at best . but i am getting too deep for you and this discussion . the point is that our god has the ability to place the stars in every corner of not only what we again , arbitrarily call our universe , but throughout all of time and space . but to we puny finite humans who have invented telescopes , it appears that these stars we are seeing today are ancient based on the perceived yet arbitrarily arrived at distance you believe they are from us . but since you are unable to even grasp the hugeness of our god , you also fail to appreciate that light years are a measure of distance rather than time . so by that definition alone , it is foolish to equate it with earth time rather than gods ability to reach any distant place in time and space and place stars there .	1
so he failed to follow procedure ? so was one of the procedures to assist the child in holding the gun while the gun was being fired and to not stand at a distance ? if that ' s the case then the instructor at the firing range was also partially at fault because it was also his responsibility to supervise the child . and i just found this : " <allcaps> springfield </allcaps> , mass . - authorities in massachusetts are considering whether criminal charges should be filed in the death of an eight - year - old boy who accidentally shot himself with an uzi submachine - gun at a gun show .

well , i am a creationist , and i would hope i can think logically ( it ' s generally a good quality for an accountant and tax attorney to have ) . the difference between microevolution and evolution as an explanation for the beginning of a species is simple . in microevolution a species is simply adapting to it ' s environments . in evolution as is usually meant by the word you are talking about the formation of an entirely new creature from inorganic compounds . if this is possible i pose a few questions for you . 1 ) why have no new creatures evolved from inorganic compounds in human memory ? 2 ) how did these inorganic compounds decide that some creatures should evolve , while others of the same species did not ? why are there not some apes that have evolved into humans by now ? why did not all apes evolve into humans ? 3 ) one of my favorite pieces of confusion from evolutionists involve fossils . how do you know how old a fossil is ? every evolutionist i have asked has stated that fossils are dated by the rock layer they are found in , but if you then ask them how the rock layer is dated they answer that it is dated by the fossils that where discovered in it ! that ' s a classical example of circular reasoning . i am not a scientist , so i cannot present all the evidence against evolution as clearly as someone with a scientific education and background might do . if you are truly interested in learning more about the creationist arguments against evolution you can check out the article located at <url> this article also has many links to other articles with even more information .	0

except that it does nothing of the sort . <repeated> but then , what can we expect from somebody citing a website trying to sell you liquid vitamin supplement . <repeated> nevertheless , we look into the pottenger ' s cats claim . here is a page called , " lesson of the pottenger ' s cats experiment : cats are not humans . " although it ' s a page aimed at explaining why this " experiment " is not applicable to humans , it exposes the other , erm , flaws in this experiment . the one striking me based on the wikipedia list of diets for the groups should be obvious to everyone : many of these cats were being deprived of protein . this page confirms and elaborates . in fact , its first point is that today ' s cats have no problem reproducing for several generations on today ' s cooked food . the difference is that good owners do not feed their pets deficient diets . the real irony here is that this experiment - - were it reliable - - would be the antithesis of supersport ' s lamarckism . in order for supersport to be supported , the cats being fed inadequate diets would re - develop those broken pathways for manufacturing essential amino acids . obviously , they did not . the only thing we see here is the effect of poor ( i . e . positively malnutritive ) diet . we can conclude that supersport ' s morton ' s demon is pretty much in full control . there ' s no other explanation for somebody seeing this experiment and thinking it supports lamarckism , or even counters evolutionary theory , even if he does not know the basics of experimentation and nutrition .	1

so are you saying that if one person prays for another person who is sick , that if the praying person believes enough then some power of belief within him is great enough to heal another person who has no such beliefs , but that is not a miracle that can be attributed to god , but is just something the person praying accomplished because they believed enough ? so when i laid hands on my 9 month old daughter and prayed for her healing in jesus name , when she then within 5 seconds opened her eyes and went from completely listless with a 103 degree temp to wide awake , happy and affectionate as she smiled at me with bright little eyes , are you saying that something within me transfered to her to bring about that instant result ? if that is true , then you must admit that something supernatural still happened , it ' s just that the power to heal transfered from me instead of from god whom i asked to heal her in jesus name . now mind you , i totally reject that , as i know it was god healing my daughter because i know rationally speaking , that i have no supernatural powers within me . and i truly understand how difficult it is for someone who has never personally experienced a miracle to not be skeptical about miracles or the supernatural , and maybe if i had experienced only one in my life then i too might question if it really happened . but i have had numerous angelic interventions that cannot be denied . and the personal spirit filled contacts with my heavenly father on a daily basis is more than one such as i am can even fully appreciate or comprehend . because you see , i am a sinner and completely unworthy to be in gods presence at all , yet he has lived within me and fellowshipped with me each and every day of my life since i accepted jesus as my savior in august of 1975 . and if you want to believe me , 2 of the angelic interventions i experienced happened before i was even saved in august of 75 . so as it is written , before the foundation of the world , god knew me . and while i was yet in the womb , he knew me . and while i was in the womb , he knew the number of hairs on my head . so also , even before i accepted jesus and was born again , my father in heaven knew me , loved me and protected me until the day of my salvation . this is why i am so adamant and stubborn in my belief and can not be moved by any unbelief . if i denied jesus and gods truth with all of the personal and first hand supernatural experiences i have had , i would be less worthy than the greatest evil doer and unbeliever in the world to receive gods grace and love as i have . i have prophesied , spoken in the language of the angels , been supernaturally saved from drowning , been saved from a violent attack which may have led to my murder as i had 5000 in cash on me at the time . but my guardian angel intervened and ran the muggers off and they never found the money . that was just one of the interventions and all i did when i saw the trouble coming was say within my mind , " lord jesus , help me " . nothing i did stopped the attack , nor could it have as these people had murder in their eyes . i had never seen such cold blooded hatred in any persons eyes before as was in this one guy . and yet within seconds i saw that rage in his eyes turn to abject terror as he looked past me , then he said to me , the next time i will kill you and they ran away like total cowards . when i turned around to see who had scared them so much and looked exactly where they looked when they looked over my shoulder , you know what i saw ? absolutely nothing . there was nobody there at all , no human anyway .	0

following the original purpose of this thread , i will summarize my own views on abortion . ( note , this is copied from an older survey on abortion beliefs - a thread in the abortion forum called " survey of views on abortion " <sad> for me , the question of abortion rights comes down to a balance between the rights of the mother and the rights of the fetus . on the side of the rights of the mother , there is a very important right to the control over one ' s own body and to not be forced to carry something as important and taxing as a pregnancy against one ' s will . some may say that , in agreeing to have sex , a woman is agreeing to a pregnancy , but i strongly disagree . a pregnancy is a possible outcome of sex but only has a very small percentage chance if birth control is used . it would be like saying that you agree to be mugged if you walk in a bad neighborhood . the great majority of sex acts - for both married and unmarried women , religious or non - religious , conservative or liberal - are not done for the purposes of having children but are done for emotional and / or purely physical reasons . pregnancy is the goal for only a minority of sex acts . so , women are not agreeing to a pregnancy when they have sex . in the case of unwanted pregnancies , it is a significant burden that they never agreed to . if they are forced to carry such a pregnancy , it would be a strong imposition against the rights over their own bodies . on the other hand , one has the rights of the fetus . what rights the fetus has depends on your belief system and priorities . for me , the most important thing when it comes to the rights of any human being is whether or not there is a mental existence - at least a rudimentary mind . i believe that i did not exist until i started to mentally exist and that applies to all others . my view is that , once a mental existence begins , the right to life of a fetus kicks in and takes priority over the mother ' s rights over her own body , under most circumstances . the neurological view is that a mind cannot exist before the third trimester . therefore , i would allow abortion - on - demand for the first and second trimester and restrict it in the third trimester . for that third trimester , i would limit abortions to those that are done to mitigate a significant risk to the mother ' s life or physical or mental health ( ex . leading to , say , paralysis or strong possibility of suicide , etc . ) and , in case of severe incurable deformations of the fetus discovered late , to end the life of a fetus that would otherwise strongly suffer ( i . e . mercy killing ) . otherwise , i believe abortions should be restricted . if a woman has not decided on an abortion by the third trimester , she should have to carry the pregnancy to term ( minus the perviously mentioned exceptions ) . she would have had ample time to decide . lastly , here are a couple of links which describe the neurological view of a mind not existing before the third trimester : part 4 of <url> <url>	0

[ 3 ] animism may also attribute souls to natural phenomena , geographic features , and even manufactured objects . religions which emphasize animism in this sense include shinto , hinduism and pagan faiths such as folk religions and neopaganism . animism - wikipedia , the free encyclopedia now show me a christian who defends id , believes that , you mental midget .	1

the idea here is to demonstrate that the odds of them realizing the same genesis is impossible . that is unless god came back again , spoke his word into a book through the scribblings of random religious scholars . if you accept that this is inevitable , you are delusional . the most likely thing would be for humans to come up with an entirely different religious doctrine . i would be willing to bet that it would pass through polytheism into monotheism as more information became available and eventually we would end up right where we are now . the problem with this scenario is that evolution would probably never be confirmed since our biological history would not be apparent . we would come up with theories that god made us and perhaps even some screwballs would say we were all part of an experiment and were placed on the planet by our ancestors a couple hundred thousand years prior .	0

if you had bothered to spend more than two seconds actually looking up what happened , you would have seen that joe horn was cleared of all wrong doings by a grand jury , not on the grounds of the new castle doctrine of texas , but the already existing laws that permits the use of deadly force for preventing property crimes . these laws were on the books for years before texas officially adopted the <allcaps> nra </allcaps> endorsed castle doctrine . and even so , what are you complaining about ? would you rather joe horn be the one killed and the criminals alive today ?	1

the simple fact is that people do not want the immense responsibility that logically pertains to their voluntary actions actions , so they fabricate denials of reality as a convenient escape , out of pure selfishness - - like every other atrocity in history . the study of law includes an analysis of how people excuse their wrongdoings , fabricating pausible rationalizations for their acting to benefit at another ' s expense ; denial is typically the first of these , claiming that the act " does not hurt anyone , " however obvious the contrary . other rationales follow , such as self - preservation , natural right to act , and eventually growing defensive by blaming the victim . while the fabricator typically believes his story original , it is anything but - - it ' s simply the inevitable course of selfishness .	0

i think i , and the other members of what i will call the " scientific community " , must be masochists of sorts as well , we continually return to these threads and bang our heads against minds that are stone walls - completely impervious to reason or logic . i think , no , i know , that there are two main reasons why i return to these threads . the first one is simple , i am amazed at the scientific illiteracy of the average <allcaps> yec </allcaps> , especially when science is often their justification for belief . the second and major reason is simply my fascination with how the mind of the creationist works . their desperation to justify their faith is so powerful it drives them to completely abandon mainstream science and logic in favour of an isolated coccoon of reality . the insecurity in their faith that the entire pseudoscience of creationism betrays is the most ironic part . as you say , most quickly realize that they are in over their heads , that what they have been told in their churches does not stand up to scrutiny in the real world . so , rather than continuing down a path that will bring them no good , they retreat and bury their heads in the comforting sand of " not knowing any better " . however , there always seems to be one or two that are so deeply entrenched , that they simply can not retreat , they have got too much invested . the psychology , more than the science , is fascinating to me . waxy	0
some interesting information , that website where you got your link from , " reasons to believe " ( <allcaps> rtb </allcaps> ) is not a creationist organisation . it is run by compromising christians , such as dr hugh ross . answers in genesis have got quite a lot of information on him and as a result have even more rebuttals to his arguments . here are several links : <url> <url> i did notice , however , that the <allcaps> rib </allcaps> article was written in the year 1999 . this is most pecular , because the aig article in which dr russell humphreys defends himself is written in the year 2000 . the following link is a very brief summary of how dr humphreys defended himself and his new relativistic cosmology from compromising christians and evolutionists : <url> the following link is where dr russell humphreys defends himself . it shows both the arguments and his rebuttals : <url> i would strongly suggest that you read it . i can definitely see how you may doubt dr humphreys new cosmology , that was a pretty heavy attack , the much of it went zip , right over my head . but i just can not help but feel that they mis - interpreted several lines and are using some straw man attacks . i personally cannot see anything wrong with his arguments , although if there is , he has given way for a new area of cosmology , a creationist cosmology . i hope that this helps clear up this little problem regarding " starlight and time " . got to go , matt .	1

the quad 50 full automatic anti - aircraft gun is designed to oscillate on it ' s mount . this is so that the bullets will come out in a pattern . this pattern along with tracer rounds helps the shooter guide the blizzard of bullets at the aircraft . even this only works at low altitudes . modern planes typically fly at ~ 3 0 k feet . that ' s more than 5 miles high ! a perfect bullet , or one that is fired in a vaccum with an initial velocity of 2800 fps will only go ~ 2 5 k feet before gravity alone will have reduced it ' s velocity to 0 fps . the odds of hitting something that is moving at ~ 900 fps at any distance with a bullet traveling at ~ 2 8 0 0 fps are slim to none . that is why anti - aircraft guns are full auto , not a semiauto or anything that a citizen has access to legally .	0

i believe that ' s true , and as a " believer " ( creationist ) , here is what is hard to understand about that ; in matthew , 12:30 , jesus says " he who is not with me is against me , and he who does not gather with me scatters " . it is safe to say that both creationists and theistic evolutionists would accept that statement from jesus , and would seek to be " with " him , while agnostic and atheists would consider themselves " not with " him . yet theistic evolutionists are comfortable to ( usually politically ) be " with " agnostics and atheists , and separate themselves from creationists . if they are genuine christians , knowing about the warnings in the bible about false teachings , how can they be comfortable with that ? miller laments in several places throughout the book that atheists use evolution as a weapon against religion , and that it should not be that way - that it causes more strife between the two than should exist .	0

to clarify : is it the womans choice whether the guy is prosecuted after he has been named , or is it the states ? by what you have said so far , it seems that all this law does is give woman the power to punish men if they get pregnant by them ; despite the fact that the woman was just as consenting as the man at the time of the coitus . there are also contraceptive paths for women that do not involve condoms . if a woman gets pregnant because she forgot to take the pill that morning and always relied on that rather than on condoms to stop her getting pregnant , why should the man be punished ? the message here should be simple . if you do not want an abortion , and are not currently in a position where you can support your children , do not have unprotected sex . at the moment , it is the woman ' s choice alone whether she has an abortion or not , so it is the woman who has to look after the child if she is single after its birth . if you want to add men to that equation , you have to add them in both places - give them the legal right to ' have an abortion ' ( force their partner to have one ) , and make them legally responsible for the child if they do not do so . then you have an entirely connected couple from coitus onwards ; both consenting to sex , both choosing not to have an abortion and both caring for the child after birth . i doubt that that law would be a popular one , either - but if you are going to force a man to take equal legal responsibility for a child , you have to give them equal legal opportunity to avoid it .	0

well , at some point they are sentient beings ( surely you agree ) , that ' s the point that the fetus becomes a person in my opinion . before that it ' s not really too bad . i do not have a problem with people " having sex in an improper way " or choosing to " screw each other how they would like to screw each other " . i do have a problem with people creating a feeling being and then killing it , as is the case when fetuses become sentient and are aborted . you also say that it is my opinion , which it is , but it is also your opinion . you have said that women who have abortion because they arn ' t responsible are making bad decisions . first off , it ' s not punishment , it ' s taking responsibility for your actions . i have addressed the men , this is what i am talking about , it was in my last post . are you really reading the my posts ? i said " they ( men ) should have to raise the child also as they are equally to blame " . if i could take some of the birthing pain from women and give it to mwn , i would . the bottom line is that women know that if pregnancy occurs their will be pain , yet some do not protect themselves against it . why would it then be my responsibility to take that pain into account ? they accepted the risk when the did not try to protect against it . yeah , like the one that i addressed the men in , right ? i have never said that we should punish 12 year old orphans . show me where i said that . i said that the parents should help raise the child if they have the means . would that put a slight damper on the 12 year olds social life ? probably , but she will be an adult soon enough and she should take some responsibility for her actions . the father should have to do the same . why do you admit that the actions of the 25 year old are tragic but you do not want her to take responsibility ? how does being poor limit your responsibility to protect yourself ? i know a poor woman who has 10 kids just hoping that one day she would find a man that would be willing to help raise the rest . also , what do you mean by " less fortunate ? it never happened but she kept having kid after kid and hoping it would . should she be excused for her behavior because she is poor ? no , she kept going to <allcaps> bars </allcaps> looking for good men . bad choices = bad outcome . do you think that this is proof that abortion is necessary ? nope , abortion <allcaps> is not </allcaps> the answer in cases like this , only responsibility can solve the problem . the bad thing is that only one of the men do anything for the children and he does not do enough . she has never filed for child support and the kids are almost never disciplined . i do not want to do anything as far as laws are concerned . i would recommend that she and the father raise the child , but sadly that may not happen . i will just continue to have pity for all of the irresponsible " lovers " out there .	1

as pointed out , with a different physics , chemistry and biology , the universe as we know it would not exist . what is really damaging to the concept of creationism as truth is a list of what we should expect if a flood had occurred under the same laws of science that are in operation today . one problem with creationism ( i know , you want to ignore the problems ) is that they constantly fall back on miracle in order to do a reset of reality in order to circumvent reality when creationism bumps into scientifically impossible events . i do not mean to rain on the parade , but with all that said , it has been done . there is a list of 28 items , originally compiled by jim moore , that we should find if the flood happened as per the bible . not even miracles can solve these . that list is followed by further problems that have been compiled by ken harding from numerous sources . what would we expect to find if the world had flooded for more information you can refer to the flood geology faqs at to . two items with information that specifically addresses the question of the op are problems with a global flood , and the geologic column and its implications for the flood .	0

thanks . but it seems that you do not understand . perhaps the people of austin are more intelligent than they are down here in houston . maybe it ' s just that you are surrounded by educated people who show a tendency away from creationism . but you see , i run into people all the time ( and meet them on this board too ) who think that speciation has never been observed . why do they think that ? because their holy book tells them so . the herring gull / lesser black - backed gull is an example of a single , vast , globe encircling population that has become separate species at the extremes of it ' s range - and those extremes overlap . before i came to texas the idea that the book of genesis was literally true never occurred to me . so it was kind of a neat moment to realize that the big birds around the restaurant dumpster were herring gulls , a living example of a population in the process of forming separate species .	0

yes , on the grounds of " mostly likely " we can make reasonable assumptions . but we must still treat them as such . part of the catch of god ' s existence is that no evidence of his existence cn ever be found . if jesus actually physically performed observable miracles , even 2000 years ago , then it would surely proven that the supernatural can and does ( or did ) exist in reality . however , even jesus ' s ministry contradicts the faith theory . how can god expect faith from those who have not observed on the grounds of those who have ? if people can observe the manifested power of god in reality , then they have physical evidence that god exists . but this conflicts with the nature of god from a biblical standpoint . in other words , the bible cannot claim that physical evidence for the existence of god can exist , and then that it cannot exist , without contradicting itself . what we end up with is the predicament that <allcaps> any </allcaps> physical evidence that could possibly support god ' s existence is evidence against god ' s existence ( at least from a biblical standpoint )	0

no i do not think that tying your tubes is abortion . i only think abortion comes into play when there is actually cells forming to make a baby , and you get them scraped out , or abort a baby before or after the third trimester . plus i heard that if you tie the tubes , when you decide you want a baby you can untie the tubes , to conceive a baby . but burning is another thing . but unless there is actual cells forming it is not abortion	0

then a man who needs an artificial heart to survive is a new species of man . that is the analogy i gave , and you ignored . in both cases ; human and bacteria , before the advent of a human product , a particular group of individuals from each larger group would die off . <allcaps> but </allcaps> along come a man - made invention that allows those certain portions to live on which otherwise would have died . in once case - nylon , the other , the artificial heart . you call this evolution . nor is it ' natural selection ' at work either , as in both cases the thing that enabled them to survive was not natural . what you have advanced as a proof of evolution actually proves what ? natural what ? i suppose people with cochlear implants are new species too because they have learnt to hear . another view of this nylon - eating - bug is given . <repeated> " finally , mr cerutti is out of date about this new nylon digesting ability allegedly from a frame shift . new evidence shows that the ability was due to plasmids [ e . g . k . kato , et al . , ? a plasmid encoding enzymes for nylon oligomer degradation : nucleotide sequence analysis of poad2 ? , microbiology ( reading ) 141 ( 10 ) : 2585 ? 2590 , 1995 . ] in fact , more than one species of bacteria have the ability , residing on plasmids . this suggests that the information probably already existed , and was just passed between different types of bacteria . " " all that would be needed to enable an enzyme to digest nylon is a mutation causing loss of specificity in a proteolytic ( protein - degrading ) enzyme . this may seem surprising ? how would a loss of information create a new ability ? answer : enzymes are usually tuned very precisely to only one type of molecule ( the substrate ) . loss of information would reduce the effectiveness of its primary function , but would enable it to degrade other substrates , too . since both nylon and proteins are broken down by breaking amide linkages , a change in a proteolytic enzyme could also allow it to work on nylon . if this process were continued , the result would be a general enzyme with a weakly catalytic effect on the hydrolysis of too many chemicals to be useful where much selectivity is required . to put it into perspective , acids and alkalis also catalyze many hydrolysis reactions , but they also lack specificity . indeed , an inhibitor of a protein degrading enzyme also inhibits the action of the nylon degrading enzyme " <url> talkorigins gave their usual doubletalk " whilst this particular case does not " prove " evolution , it is consistent with , and supportive of , the theory of biological evolution . " why do they say this ? because it ' s still a bacteria . it ' s not like it suddenly became a large multi - cellular organism . but it might just prove that this bug was so well designed that it can cope with newer situations . one site does say that it , the bacteria , had the capability already within it of change ? not resultant in ? mutations ? , but more like switching on previously dormant apparatus . <url> one poster on another forum summed the problem up like this . <repeated> " in order for species to advance there would have to be a net information gain , which is not the case with nylon eating bacteria . the bacteria gained the ability to digest nylon , therefore was able to survive in a new environment . two distinct advantages but , the bacteria lost its ability to survive in its old environment , eat its former diet and suffered a 98% loss in efficiency . three disadvantages . so by taking two steps forward and three steps backward , where is the net gain ? if nylon eating bacteria was " proof " of evolution , we would still be pond scum , but with the ability to digest whatever happened to become the primary food source .

clearly this is true . there are a multitude of denominations from every religion . this is as specially true with christianity because the texts do not explain how all the ceremonies are done . baptism was performed in areas where full immersion could not have occurred but the best explanations of baptism paint a picture of a full immersion . the church of christ believes one must baptize in the name of jesus , the father , son and holy ghost thing was while jesus lived . because the practice of speaking in tongues was used by the first church , some believe the art must stay in the church . most of the complications to christianity is simply because the followers really believed jesus would return . no one wrote a book on the religion . the religion changed a great deal through time . king james was no saint and he had clear reasons he would not allow some letters into an authorized version he would sign on to . one letter spoke of the sin of slavery . this was clearly at odds with king james . other items would have direct negative effects on the kingdom and i will let others find the reasoning behind the withdraws .	0
but when some are ignorant enough to believe in a false science like evolution , which is based on lies and deceptions , they prove right there that they have not enough knowledge of the truth , nor a sense of discernment that is capable of even determining what is true or a lie . so who are you people to even judge the intelligence of those who will ultimately be proven to have known the truth regarding our origins , to the lies that you so proudly defend ? i say this only so you pseudo intellectuals will have some personal introspection to consider rather than just assuming that you will get the correct answers by leaning on human understanding . it is incredible that you can not even see that you are bankrupt when you rely on unprovable assumptions that are based on preconceived notions , that have been both failing and conflicting with all of the new discoveries made in each generation to follow , thereby forcing the need to redefine the parameters by which evolution works every 10 years or so . so evolution is not a science , it ' s a working piece of fiction in progress that is constantly being tweaked and shaped to fit the preconceptions no matter what new evidence is discovered that contradicts it .	0

so where in there does behe say that brute luck is actually impossible ? nowhere . where in there does behe say that brute luck can be absolutely and definitively ruled out , 100% . nowhere . as i originally said , “ we can find such an explanation wanting or unsatisfying , but being highly unlikely is not the same as proving it could not happen . ” this is quite in line with behe ' s statements in his book . further , <allcaps> proving </allcaps> it <allcaps> impossible </allcaps> is what you would have had to have done to <allcaps> prove </allcaps> that evolution is false . behe says it can not be proven impossible : that it can not be completely refuted . ( and quite frankly , most of us would agree that claiming that an ic system - or multiple ic systems - arose by multiple simultaneous mutations is in no way comparable to claiming that “ the word luckily popped into existence yesterday with all the features it now has . ” behe ' s not being fully honest here . ) what i quoted behe saying is exactly what he said and is his position on the matter . i have <allcaps> not </allcaps> misrepresented behe ' s position on this . now , a charge of wrongdoing is discarded unless the party making the accusation can fully support his charge : burden of proof falls upon the accuser , not the accused . you have failed to support your charge , so i prevail . now , if you want to continue pushing your charge of wrongdoing on my part , you need to show where , in behe ' s “ darwin ' s black box ” , he goes on to show that brute luck is actually impossible : where behe shows that brute luck can be absolutely and definitively ruled out , 100% . until you do , you have failed to rebut my counter to your statements , and , i am also cleared of your false charges . ps : the only one playing around with context here is <allcaps> you </allcaps> ! the context of my statements was that you claimed to have <allcaps> proven evolution </allcaps> false , and i pointed out that : ( 1 ) in order for you to have succeeded , one of several things you would have to do ( but did not ) is to <allcaps> disprove </allcaps> multiple , simultaneous mutations ( brute luck ) and ( 2 ) behe himself says that multiple , simultaneous mutations <allcaps> cannot </allcaps> be absolutely ruled out . try to keep the context , okay .	0
maybe you need to take a hard look at where your rights start infringing on the rights of others . a pretty good case ? dream on . sure , you have the rigth to take the morning after pill . you do not have the right to force another individual to sell you that pill , any mroe than you have the right to walk into your local ford dealer and demand that they provide your with a chevy . its just not the way the world works . people can go to another pharmacy or , not . it really does ntoy matter . retail establichments are able to decide fro themselves what they carry , the governemtn has no place in such decisions . if they decide not to carry the pill , or the pharmacist simply decides they are not going to dispense it , that is their right . it is entirely an issue between employers and their employees and witht he the american pharmacists associations policy that allows pharmacists to refuse to fill presciptions on moral grounds , it is hardly an issue there , either .	0

stop telling me to look at the big picture when you have had both of your eyes gouged out ! your entire statement here is beyond stupid . if the criminals felt that the only time to be armed was when their intended victims could fight back , then the criminals in dc would never be armed and the police would not have needed to introduce gun shot sensors in the city . but since dc was the murder capital of the united states , that says an absence of hard targets is not a guarantee that the abusers will play fair and not use weapons .	1
i ' d love to see an explanation about how the study of the natural world disproves the existence of all deities . especially the deistic gods . and i ' d love to see how science is suppose to disprove a being that is not bound by logic , reason or any laws . what science can do is disprove that god was directly responsible for this or that , the sun rising , the rain season , etc . did you perhaps realize that many scientists are buddhists because buddhism which has beings that behave as gods with such powers and exist partially within the natural and supernatural ? or are you again assuming all religions do not exist except for christanity ?	1
but they did not have sexual relations . this was from a sperm bank - there was nothing that made the two people create one being . nonetheless , this is a side issue for future debates . my main point is homosexuality is a disorder that the government should not be condoning . the government obviously does not condone pedophilia , poligamy , and incest . why is the government condoning homosexuality ?	0

well is this serious science or is this ring - around - the - rosie on sesame street ? am i just supposed to play make - believe and / or use my imagination ? i can do that - - for instance , when i play with my kids , i am real good at playing the role of " ken " when we imagine that " barbie goes to the beach " surely the fossil record shows gradualism or not . i bought a book a while back at a half - price bookstore from niles eldredge . he says the following about gradualism : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - change in this manner ( gradualism ) is just not found in the fossil record . pg . 48 darwin invented the myth that species were not real to convince the world of the nonmyth that evolution had occured . pg . 52 darwin ' s prediction that long - term evolutionary change should produce a systematic pattern of gradual , progressive change in the fossil record was faulty . pg . 53 as we have seen in the previous chapter , the usual conception casts evolution as a gradual , steady process of adaptive change . and we have already seen that the fossil record conflicts with that view . pg . 57 we are faced more with a great leap of faith - - that gradual , progressive , adaptive change underlies the general pattern of evolutionary change we see in the rocks - - than any hard evidence . pg . 57 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - i guess i would consider myself more of a pe guy than a gradualist simply because of what the fossils indicate . it seems to me that instead of evolving gradually that animals evolve quickly - - like the spiders on my shed . ( do you find it odd that they emerged yellow in the spring ? ) it seems butterflies have this same ability . <repeated> evolution sure is amazing ! for instance , monteiro said , the darker wing patterns that show up in butterflies that emerge in the spring serve to warm up the butterfly faster , whereas butterflies that emerge in the summer have lighter colors . " also , many butterflies that emerge in the wet season in the tropics have large , conspicuous marks on their wings that deflect the attacks of predators while the butterflies are actively finding mates and laying eggs , while the dry - season cohorts are very cryptic , trying to blend in with their environment and not attract any attention from predators until the rains arrive again , " she said <url>	1

this brings up an interesting point , and that is that science is extremely limited . using your logic , persons should not have believed in the fact that the earth is a round object floating in space before it was proven scientifically , even though it was a fact then , as it is now . this fact was written about in scripture long before science " proved " it , just as the description of the hydrological system was described in scripture long before scientists figured it out . <allcaps> this </allcaps> is where the evidence can be found for the validity of the bible . when you find scripture after scripture of historical fact and scientific reference that is found to be accurate , you should tend to take is seriously . the problem with science is its arrogance . it ' s inability to see that truth can be found in other areas is a real handicap . add to that theories like evolution that disguise themselves as science , and you have a real problem . one does not stand on a train track with a train barreling down on them to " prove " they will die . this " fact " is usually taken to be reliable , even though that person has not " proven " it to be true through experimentation . if you need scientific proof for everything you believe , you have a real problem . if this were the case , no legal decision on guilt or innocence could be rendered in a court room , since the decision is usually rendered based on the preponderance of the evidence related to a crime that was commited in the past . we have the same problem with the origin of life and evolution of species - macro changes that supposedly occured in the past . as such , every availble form of investigation should be followed up on . this includes metaphysical possibilities . they can be investigated just as evolution is , buy the study of history , manuscripts , archeological methods and statistical and prophetic evidences . both scientists and creationists are talking about investigation to find truth , and to self limit your investigative techniques is not only reckless , but might be a form of self delusion . requiring truth to conform to your standards , as scientists of the past did , can either cause great delay in finding truth , or cause you to miss it entirely .	1

again monty has shown that he does not bother to learn what he is talking about before he speaks . it is not true that science has " found " the mitochondrial eve , nor is it true that it shows that one person can have all the <allcaps> dna </allcaps> necessary for all the variation in human population . both ideas are ridiculous in the extreme . the mitochondrial ( note spelling monty ) eve is a mathematical concept . if the estimates of the mutation rate of mitochondrial <allcaps> dna </allcaps> are correct , then she lived about 200,000 years ago or so . and of course , the variation in human populations is carried by the nuclear <allcaps> dna </allcaps> , not the mitochondria . high school biology students know this . and , of course , recent analysis has shown that every gene in the human genome has an average of 14 alleles . since a single person can carry only two alleles of any gene , monty ' s assertion becomes pure nonsense . hank says :	1

so you are a historian now ? yes , you are right - the civil war was fought to keep the union in tact . but , it is also a fact that abraham lincoln , the commander in chief of the union army , did not believe that the union could be preserved unless slavery was abolished . according to who ? though it may not have been practiced to its fullness , it in no way follows that all men are not created equal . someone who actually had knowledge about the civil war would certainly know that lincoln did not believe the union could be preserved unless slavery was abolished . and i do not expect you to . the reason you will not go into how all men were created equal during reconstruction is because you cannot prove that all men are not created equal .	1

this is a statement written by someone who obviously has not read scripture . one of the most astonising " proofs " if you will , that the bible is of supernatural origin , is predictive prophecy . science cannot , as you claim , " explain " everything , and it has no natural explanation for the predictions made in scripture . how can science explain through statistical probablity the over 600 prophecies in biblical writings that have come to pass ? also , how can it explain how supposedly uneducated people ( uneducated in the ways of modern science ) wrote about astronomy as if they knew about the universe as we do today . how could they have described the hydrological cycle as we have only come to know it recently ? ecclesiastes 1 : 6 the wind goes toward the south , and turns around to the north ; the wind whirls about continually , and comes again on its circuit . how did they know that the earth " hangs on nothing " when the accepted norm of the day did not even accept that possibility ? job 26 : 7 he stretches out the north over empty space ; he hangs the earth on nothing . how did they know that the " vapors " of the earth rise to create moisture , that is seeded by lightning with nitrogen and then falls as rain to fertilze the soil ? jeremiah 10:13 when he utters his voice , there is a multitude of waters in the heavens : ? and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth . he makes lightning for the rain , he brings the wind out of his treasuries ? . <repeated> hydrothermal vents [ 4 ] are described in two books of the bible written before 1 4 0 0 bc ? more than 3,000 years before their discovery by science . genesis 7:11 in the six hundredth year of noah ? s life , in the second month , the seventeenth day of the month , on that day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up , and the windows of heaven were opened . even though the bible is not a scientific text book and does not purport to be , nowhere is it scientifically inaccurate . in addition , many of the scientific ideas you are so impressed with are nothing new to the bible . it was speaking of these things long before modern science spoke of them . the story goes " they ( scientists ) are slowly working their way to the mountain ' s peak painstakingly measuring and analyzing every step that they take . after many years of research , they finally arrive at the top of the mountain , scale over its leading edge , only to find a group of theologians sitting there with the answers all along .

well , now this is the question that really matters , and the answer is a long one . but to state it as simply as possible : denying same - sex marriage hurts many people . it forces same - sex couples to pay for the marriage of opposite - sex couples while no one is forced to pay for their marriages . it denies them access to raise children and ability to cover their children and spouses with their medical insurance , along with the many other benefits of marriage . it uses the law to teach the people that the lifestyle and religion held by same - sex couples is wrong , and this forces them to feel the disapproval of society . there is no reason to perpetuate these harms . i have heard many arguments opposed to same - sex marriage , but there is not even one of them that justifies these harms . in fact , i would even say that there is not one argument against same - sex marriage that makes logical sense at all . thus , even if same - sex marriage brought no benefits , there would be no reason to keep it illegal ; a free and equal society does not deny rights or benefits to anyone , unless it has a very good reason to . and there just is not any reason to deny rights and benefits to same - sex couples .	0

well , the short version is that shortly after the big bang , the universe was filled by a hot quark plasma . as it expanded and cooled , the process of nucleosynthesis produced the primordial elemental abundance , primarily hydrogen , with some deutirium , helium , and lithium . the physics is well understood , and verified by observation . quantifying uncertainties in primordial nucleosynthesis without monte carlo simulations at roughly a billion years of age , stars and galaxies formed , some fraction of the stars that formed were massive supergiants , that burned up their hydrogen into other elements , up to the atomic number of iron . this occurred at a tremendous rate and in a few more billion years , these stars went supernova and exploded . prior to going supernova , these stars go through a phase where the outer layers of the star are shed , providing ways to transport the lighter elements away from the star . you can see this in the following link : hubble chemically analyzes the ring around supernova 1 9 8 7 a the trememdous radiation of the supernova permits the formation of elements with atomic numbers higher than iron . the force of these explosions scattered the newly created elements , creating vast gas and dust clouds . eventually , the shockwave of another explosion initiated the collapse of one of these clouds , and the spinning hydrogen cloud begins to heat , eventually initiating nuclear fusion , and becoming our sun . as the sun began to increase it ' s heat output , the volatile remains of the accretion disk are driven away from the inner portion of the solar system , leaving mostly heavy elments . comets bombarded the inner solar system , transporting water , carbon , and amino acids to the newly forming earth , making dirt . in short , a truely wonderful creation .	1

i would say that the soul is that part of us that is immortal . it is our essence . our personality may impact or is impacted by it , but i would say it is far more . indeed , i would say it is what psychologists call emergent downward causality . as for the role of god , science has not disproven any of it . science has explained how things occur but that does not eliminate the possibility of god nor does it limit what god does . we would simply not be understanding gods fit in the science of it . that makes sense given that god is considered infinite and we are finite . i think the soul is what gives us the possibility of even imagining the infinite . the idea that we can see beyond what we are or even to conceptualize such things gives a clue that there is more to us than meets the eye . i do not see why god and science cannot coexist . even evolution and creation . forget planting evidence . that is too far fetched . i would rather think that it is more likely that what god says actually fits the evidence even though we cannot understand it . i do not know about god or " not god " ( if you will ) but if there is a god then the idea that he is beyond what i can actually conceive and yet completely conceivable makes sense for that kind of being . it should be an apparent paradox to me . if it is not , then my concept of god is far <elongated> r <elongated> to small to be of any use to anyone . huck .	0

color is a function of the wavelength of light . thus , quantum considerations aside , there are a nigh infinite number of colors . humans , of course , can only see a subset of those colors , ranging from about 400 to 700 nanometers . in particular , our eyes have cells " tuned " to three ranges of wavelengths ; blue , red , and green . you could think of those as short , medium , and long wavelengths . by extrapolating from the relativity intensities from the particular cells we can " figure out " what wavelength is entering our eyes . <url> does this dispell your confusion ? edit : and just to address one other point , scientists are well aware of the limitations of the human eye . that ' s why , when exact determination of color is important , machines that can read precise wavelengths are used , rather than relying on the known to be limited instrument which is the human eye .	1

nearly all animal phyla * made their first appearance in the fossil record at essentially the same time , an interval of some 5 million years [ et * *] ( about 525 to 530 million years ago [ et * *]) called the " cambrian explosion . " 51 scientists have found that these early fossils exhibit more anatomical body designs than exist today , and that early animals , the trilobites , had eyes as fully developed as their counterparts today . 38 many of the cambrian fauna , still survive today , all looking much like they did over 500 million [ et * *] years ago . the prominent british evolutionist , richard dawkins , comments , " . <repeated> [ w ] e find many of them already in an advanced state of evolution , the very first time they appear . it is as though they were just planted there , without any evolutionary history . " 51 two places in the world that have an abundance of early ( cambrian ) fossils ; the burgess shale in the canadian rockies and the chengjiang site in china . 38 in stephen j . gould ' s popular book , wonderful life , he points out that the burgess shale cambrian fossils include " a range of disparity in anatomical design never again equaled , and not matched today by all the creatures in the world ' s oceans . " 38 further , these fossils contain some twenty to thirty kinds of arthropods * * * that cannot be placed in any modern group . the modern arthropods , consisting of almost a million species , can all fit into four major groups . but " one quarry in british columbia , representing the first explosion of multicellular life , reveals more than twenty additional arthropod designs . " today there are about 38 phyla in existence , but the canadian , chinese and other cambrian sites reveal over fifty phyla . 38 there has been a decrease in diversity ( probably due to global catastrophes ) . this is the reverse of what evolutionary theory predicts . 38 besides diversity , the burgess shale shows exquisite detail , right down to " the last filament of a trilobite ' s gill , " or the last meal in a worm ' s gut . 38 the chengjiang site has even greater detail , and is earlier . according to paul chien , the chairman of the biology department at the university of san francisco , said the preservation is such that internal organs , nerves , and even the water ducts of jellyfish are observable . 38 researchers found striking similarities between the compound eyes of the cambrian trilobites and those of modern insects . according to riccardo levi - setti , " trilobites could see in their immediate environment with amazingly sophisticated optical devices in the form of large composite eyes . . <repeated> the number of individual optical elements in the compound eye could vary from approximately one hundred to more than fifteen thousand in a single eye , a range not very different from that found in modern insects . " 38 the conclusion is that the eye , a complex visual system , was fully formed and functional extremely early in the fossil record . obviously , this is not predicted by evolutionary theory . 38 until recently , the phylum of vertebrates had been considered a later arrival in evolutionary history . but not now ! even the vertebrate phylum now extends into the cambrian period , especially with the recent discovery of two fossil fish in china . 51 the two new fossils . . . from chengjiang are the most convincing early cambrian vertebrates ever found . the insects and other land invertebrates are also a very important group , and these practically all seem to be living fossils . 51 these complex animals were present at the beginning of multicellular life and did not appear later as is predicted by evolutionary theory . 38 evolution does not explain the abrupt appearance of complex forms of life early in the fossil record or these fossils ' unequaled diversity . the implication of the cambrian explosion of diverse , fully functional , and multicellular life is that evolutionary theory is falsified . 38 life did not start out simple and evolve into more complex and diverse animals ; it was complex and diverse right at the beginning . this contradiction between the fossil data and the predictions of evolutionary theory falsifies the theory . 38 " the facts of paleontology seem to support creation rather than evolution . all the major groups of invertebrates appear suddenly in the first fossiliferous strata . ( cambrian ) of the earth with their distinct specializations , indicating that they were all created at almost the same time . " - david enock associate professor of biology . bs yeshiva college , ms hunter college50 even george gaylord simpson , harvard high priest of evolution had to admit , “ in spite of the examples , it remains true ( as every paleontologist knows ) that most new species , genera and families appear in the record suddenly , and are not led up to by known , gradual , completely continuous transitional sequences . ” 50 <url>	0

yes , because although we trust our military with anti tank missiles , . 50 machine guns , artillery , fighter planes , cruise missiles and even nuclear weapons , god knows you would not want them parading around in public with a glock under their jacket unless they have renewed their permit in person . i would have thought that people would have learned their lesson from the federal assault weapon ban . it was expensive to enforce , a major sore spot for a fairly large percentage of the population , and had no real positive effect , mainly due to the fact that it addressed no identifiable problem . you expect such things from a liberal stronghold like california , a state with high crime that is always on the verge of bankruptcy , out of control labor costs , where they can not even keep the power on all the time becuase their environmental regulations are so rediculously stringent that the fiscal realities of building new powerplants are soo terrible that nobody would even consider it . i thought people were more intelligent in your new state , george .	1

let me try explaining this another way . according to the logic presented in the original article : gun owners : discrimination by gun control laws : : serial rapists : discrimination by anti - rape laws you see , it ' s the <allcaps> relationship </allcaps> that i am comparing . that ' s what an analogy is . i am <allcaps> not </allcaps> comparing the gun owners to the serial rapists , but rather the <allcaps> relationship </allcaps> between discrimination and gun owners as presented in the original article and the <allcaps> relationship </allcaps> between discimination and serial rapists . what do you mean " my ultimate agenda " ? i want regulation of the gun trade as there is regulation of the trade of every product with specific control laws that apply to each product . does this mean a complete ban ? no . let us compare this to a drivers license . yes i realize that ' s not a product , but it is regulated similar to the way guns should be regulated . it varies from state to state , but there is typically a driver ' s ed class , driving with an instructor , and a driving test . a person must pass all of these things before recieving a license . a person must also meet other qualifications such as vision requirements . then , in my state , when a person recieves his or her license , it is only a provisional license , meaning that he or she cannot drive between midnight and 5 a . m . this lasts for eighteen months unless there are any moving violations , in which case the period starts over . these are all reasonable restrictions . these ideas can be applied to gun control . there could be gun training and gun tests . background information such as prior criminal activities should be checked . guns should not be made available at unregulated events such as gun shows . these sort of regulations are also similar to those on prescription drugs . a person must have a prescription from a real doctor , and he or she can only purchase or pick up the medicine from certified locations . this is clearly not a fringe view since a large number of people support gun control . you may disagree with this view , but it clearly is not a fringe view . nor is it a sign of mental instability . the constitutionality of gun control is clearly debatable . it ' s not exactly simple . you can not ignore " well regulate . " even guncite , a pro gun website , says , " ' to put in good order ' is the correct interpretation of well regulated , signifying a well disciplined , trained , and functioning militia . " disciplining , training . that sounds like controlling . and if it was such a simple constitutional issue , why has not the supreme court made a difinitive ruling on it ? if anything , it has ruled in favor of gun control , saying in the miller case that " the second amendment must be interpreted and applied with a view to its purpose of rendering effective the militia . " regardless , the constitutionality of a law does not make it wrong or right . slavery was once allowed under the constitution , but that did not make it wrong or right . i never labeled your view as anarchistic . i said that <allcaps> unless </allcaps> you are an anarchist , you are not in support of <allcaps> complete </allcaps> , 100% , <allcaps> absolute </allcaps> freedom . what objective means are you using to determine that gun ownerships is a basic civil right ? first you assume that since i have liberal views on this subject , i agree with the actions of all other liberals , and second you assume that all other liberals commit the same actions . i have not once mentioned " saturday night special . " my laws are meant to target all gun crime and gun accidents . should we not have laws against gun crime ( not laws against guns ) because most gun violence is minority on minority . sould we not have murder laws because a disproportionate number of murders are commited by minorities ?	1
and why would i be anti christianity when i am christian ? oh and by the way to who ever it was who said i do not believe in jesus , or something to that extent , i never said anything to that extent , you just made up what you wanted and got mad about it . i believe in the teachings of jesus . yes i am betting your asking me how i know about his teachings if i have never read the bible , my mom is someone who has re - read the bible like 6 or 7 times . so she ' s told me all about it , and what its supposed to teach us .	0

evolution theory is not science at all , it is faith . period . how can i conclude that ? because an examination of the evidence shows that a bias / ideology / godless belief system is the only real evidence for evolution theory : evolutionist stephen jay gould : ? our ways of learning about the world are strongly influenced by the social pre - conceptions and biased modes of thinking that each scientist must apply to any problem ? . <repeated> evolutionary biologist richard lewontin said : ? we have a prior commitment to materialism . it is not that the methods and institutions of science somehow compel us to accept a material explanation of the phenomenal world , but , on the contrary , that we are forced by our priori adherence to material causes to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concepts that produce material explanations , no matter how counter - intuitive ? moreover , that materialism is an absolute , for we cannot allow a divine foot in the door ? . <repeated>	0

but i suppose the pope is going to hell here is a link to a website that has a brief list of translational fossils , there are gaps but that could mean that we have yet to find those fossils , or we have found them but no one has made the link yet . you also keep stating that evolution is theory , we all agree it is still a theory but it is the most plausible theory that fits the evidence found that evolution is the most likely mechanism to explain that we have lots of different species , to condense it to the real basics just think of it as the ancestry of the species . ( apologies for condensing the theory into those small sentences could be here forever explaining evolution ) n . b evolution does not mention how life started , there is another scientific theory on the origin of life on earth , but i can not think of it at this moment . hunter it is really not good form on a message board when debating a subject to say someone is going to hell because they do not agree with your viewpoint , present your evidence why you believe that evolution is incorrect and we can have a proper debate .	1
homosexuals are attracted to adults of the same sex . pedophiles are attracted exclusively to children . there are people , such as the case with these priests , who molest children , who are not pedophiles . molestation , like rape , is not about sexual attraction . it is <allcaps> violence </allcaps> . people do not molest or rape because they are so turned on they can not help themselves , they do it to <allcaps> hurt </allcaps> somebody . get some information before shooting off at the mouth <allcaps> vor </allcaps> . most of those priests were probably niether gay nor pedophiles . <allcaps> i hate it </allcaps> - when people spread this * * * * . it is <allcaps> false </allcaps> information that does nothing but <allcaps> harm </allcaps> . it puts blame on the innocent while the guilty get ignored and children get hurt . do not use this lie to justify your bigotry - for you do so at the cost of innocent people - adults and children .	1

you are getting to a more complicated area where " mental existence " no longer matters . i have explained earlier that it is not exactly the same as " self defense " so i do not think a similiar response is needed . furthermore , you are saying mental existence is not solely the thing that gives you value but rather it depends on outside influences and chance . at some point it just seems like the stance on abortion is that the woman is more important no matter what . this is why i claim some will rank humans above other humans . <repeated> a dangerous precedent which we have tried before .	0

when will it stop ? never . they will take every gun , every toy gun , disarm the law enforcment community , give us nerf batons so we do not actually hurt the criminals , and say that this kinder gentler way of doing things will help . in the meantime murders will go through the roof , like in australia , rape will escalate , breaking and entering will become common place , and cops will die by the minute . they will not only confiscate the guns , but then charge the owners of those guns for being terrorists . it will not end . in order to establish true dependency upon a government you must force the populous to rely completely on the government for every aspect of life including safety .	0
but it took a lot longer to develop . my point was that only after about 5000 years of human civilization did empiricism as science develop . religion , supernaturalism , and mythology trace back into prehistory . what we know as science did not even begin to exist until the late 1 5 0 0 s and 1 6 0 0 s . before that it was ok to do science like aristotle did - no experiment , only thinking about a logical answer . thus , heavy objects fell faster than light ones and any fool could tell that the sun orbited the earth . but science is more than an inner way of thinking . it is a process and a method for learning about the universe . it is called methodological naturalism . that is not to say the science asserts that nothing exists except what is natural . it says that science can not study the supernatural .	0
gun control is not on this list of crime contributing factors . however banning guns would leave the law - abiding defenseless in the face of these criminal predators . why do not you work for changing these conditions instead of working for something that has no effect on reducing crime ( gun control ) . however , if you think you can prove gun control will work as crime control , then go for it ! maybe you can cower us with your overwhelming evidence .	1

a more precise term would be " broaden , " since nothing about the definition pertaining to the people currently covered by it would be affected , " diluted " or altered in any way anyone has yet demonstrated . nothing about the definition that pertains to people who already are , or can be married changes one iota . their rights , benefits , and protections remain exactly the same . the only " change " would be to other people , people who have no connection to , nor impact on , the marriages of anyone else : the gays who will marry if the legal definition is broadened to encompass them . and the only " change " in that regard will be the fact that they are encompassed by it , nothing more . no substantive aspect of the definition as it currently stands changes in the slightest . the change is not in the definition itself . it ' s in who it applies to .	0
to me , part of the point of the " please , no scripture " comment would be to forgo any insistence that we worship god just because the bible says to . a person could insist that sons pay some form of homage / respect to their father on father ' s fay , but i would argue that it ' s not reasonable to do so in every case . for example , if the father was physically or sexually abusive , or the father abandoned his children , those would be reasons to fore - go any father ' s day formalities . and " god " could be viewed as the absent father . suppose we assume that he created the earth and life on the earth . what ' s his involvement been since then ? should we worship him just because he ' s god ? or , depending upon how one sees god , is god a being unworthy of worship and idolization ? and along those lines , utilizing the bible as a reference could be a double - edged sword . the " god " of the old testament ordered slavery , misogyny , genocide , women as spoils of war , . <repeated>	0

i know this may seem obvious to most people , but it seems to have escaped the notice of creationists . birds are tetrapods , as are amphibians , reptiles , and mammals . birds did not just grow wings . wings are adaptions of the front limbs that were covered with feathers . perhaps you are unaware of the evidence that indicates that maniraptors had feathers , probably for thermoregulation . saying that there is no mechanism for birds to grow wings when they previously had none is like saying that there is no mechanism for mankind to grow arms when he previously had none . you see , mankind ' s closest relatives are the two species of chimpanzee - they are quadrupeds .	1

well , sort of . it is not necessary , but if you are predicting intelligence from what someone does rather than direct measurements of physical properties , knowing their motivation level might allow you to make more accurate predictions . nevertheless even without knowing the subjects ' motivations at all , today ' s generic intelligence tests still have excellent predictive power for success in both school and employment , and are perhaps better predictors for future success than any other method we have ( including interviews , personality inventories , aptitude in a particular field )	0

but you have not looked . you may claim that your god did it , and no evidence to support or deny that can be offered . the assertion relies on miracle and has no suporting evidence . but when you start talking about how your god did it , your claims can be debunked by facts . certainly the mythology of ancient nomadic herdsmen is not accurate . if you look at the world and the history of the world the is evident in the geologic strata , then you can see that the earth is very old , and you can see a succession of organisms through time . when considered with other fields of science from genetics to biogeography to physiology and anatomy , evolution becomes apparent .	0

again with the common sense , but that is another issue alltogether . you are arguement that the brain is a fundamental unit of life is just plain wrong , considering the majority of all organisms do not have one . bacteria , protists , plants , fungi , and some animals are all without brains . brains are required for motion and fast response to immediate changes in environment , for example a falling rock . brains cluster nerves so that appropriate action can be taken . some brains are amazingly simple while others like our own are immensly complex . your arguements all show a general lack of study in biology and my common sense is appalled by yours . i am reminded of bill maher who once said about the intelligent design debate : " because you do not have to teach both sides of an arguement when one side is retarded .

really , then show me how i am wrong - without dogmatic statements . i would suggest , given the fact that you feel the need to ignore science , deny obvious facts of reason , and cling to evolutionary theory , that it is you that has the problem with religion - your naturalistic religion . i would further suggest that you stop attibuting your personal opinions to science , and start calling your comments what they really are , personal opinion . - by the way , is everyone who disagrees with you promoting a " religious agenda ?

interesting thought . <repeated> such a situation would theorectically remove the division of opinion that exists based upon the perspective of gender ( ie . the pro - life religious male ) and would make any difference of opinion be based on moral / philosophical considerations alone . you could argue it would shift opinion towards the mix currently held by women as everyone would be in the position of having to bear pregnancy . given that there is a full mix of religious and other beliefs in the current day female population perhaps this would be a good analogy to such a state of being you suggest .	0

but then it also does not answer the question " does anything exist " , nor does it answer an infinite number of " existence " questions . do " trolls " exist , follows the same reasoning . if you find one , they are no longer a fairy tale / imaginary creature , they are some organic life form that can be measured , tested , and quantified . <repeated> i . e . no longer an imaginary creature . so they can no more be found than god . so replace god / troll with an infinite number of other imaginary things and you will see why the question " does god exist ? " , has no real importance in the physical universe . ( does the tooth fairy exist , does a unicorn exist , do flying pigs exist , etc . ) in fact , i like that statement . the existence of god is not imporant . <repeated> rather - the <allcaps> faith </allcaps> in god ( s , etc . ) is what is " important " , and the thoughts most certainly exist in the physical world and have a measureable impact . i think that ' s why i do not mind so much " religion " per se , it ' s the human condition that brings suffering , and uncertainty , into our lives and for some people , the feelings brought about by their faith seems to treat the condition . ( the human condition also brings joy , love , etc . , but i ' d like that without the pain personally ) i only mind it when things in the physical universe are " attacked " with the premise of belief in god ( s ) , which is a waste of human energy . <repeated> we have a limited time , do not spend it using fallacy to undermine those who are actually trying to build on the foundation of human knowledge . and any belief in something without evidence scares me if it becomes a driving force behind decisions . . <repeated> she ' s a witch because she <allcaps> made </allcaps> the crops die . <repeated> she must be burned . . <repeated> he broke " god ' s " law and therefore must be guilty . <repeated> . <repeated> this is " god ' s " war . <repeated> yeah , that still scares me . that ' s why i think , at least in the us , the seperation of church and state is so ridiculously important , and accepted . while there are fundamentalists that rail against it . <repeated> it ' s hopefully obvious that with ~ 80% of the us believing in an imaginary " god " , but also having a separation of church and state and the most generally advanced scienctific community in the world , then the two can obviously co - exist , and i ' d go so far as to say thrive as long as the line is drawn and not crossed . i learned something in responding , thanks for the spark . - mach	0
oh . you just lost me . the fact is , jesus warned his followers that they would be persecuted for his sake . read matthew 10 : 5 - 42 , if you care for the full text . basically he told them they would be beaten , thrown in prison , crucified , and put to death if they followed him . and that is exactly what happened to the disciples and all those who gave a witness for christ as lord and savior . the various roman emperors in those years of the early church sought to kill every christian they could find , men , women , and children . christians were crucified by the thousands , covered in pitch , and sit afire to provide light for the emporer ' s lavish garden parties . they were killed in the arena by wild animals and tortured to death in numerous ways . they were called martyrs , which now means one who dies for a cause . the word is greek and means “ witness ” . these witnesses for christ were killed for their faith . how many christians would we have today if they had to die for their faith ? in spite of everything that the emperor did , they could not kill the christians fast enough . more were believing in christ every day , and eventually even the roman emperor himself became a christian and christianity was embraced and sanctioned .	0
so you think that , if murders were legal , there would still be the same number ? how about robberies , or rapes ? there are plenty of those , the law can not be having any effect . <repeated> in short , i am saying that making anything illegal reduces that thing . criminalising murder results in less murder , criminalising drugs leads to reduced supply of drugs ( compare any drug with nicotine , or alcohol ) , and criminalising guns would lead to a similar reduction .	1

it depends on the particular situation . some adoption agencies ask about it , and some do not . most social workers who do home studies are aware that they have gay clients doing adoptions . some adoptive gay parents are out about it , and some keep it quiet . there are currently some foreign countries that require adoptive single parents to sign an affadavit that says , " i am not homosexual . " those are the rules of some foreign countries , notably china , not the united states or any state . china has recently placed greater restrictions on prospective adoptive parents . they have sharply limited the opportunities for single people to adopt , and it looks like they may prohibit single - parent adoptions entirely . they have also instituted a weight requirement for all adoptive parents . in the case of a couple , their combined weight has to be below a certain figure or they are not allowed to adopt . no fat people allowed to adopt , which cuts out possibly most americans .	0

this is a pretty touchy issue , and i agree with the different points of view . <repeated> most of them make sense . <repeated> while i do not personally agree with abortion , i do not feel that i have the right to tell someone else what they should do . the way i see it , is that it ' s their body , their life , they are the ones who will be affected by their decision . i do not have to like the choices someone else makes , and i do not have to agree with it , but while i have that right , i also believe that people should have the right to make those decisions . are these anti - abortion people going to step in and pay for the cost of having the baby , raising it , etc ? . <repeated> maybe some of those are the issues people consider when having an abortion . maybe the woman was raped . i see the point when someone said that the baby should not be punished for that , and i agree with that , but the rape was committed against the woman ' s will . <repeated> she did not ask for that to happen , and if a pregnancy results from that , that is also against her will , so why should she feel that she has to have the child ? what does she tell the child when it decides to ask who its father is ? <repeated> the child could still be born and given up for adoption , and that is a good idea , but maybe the woman will relive the rape throughout the pregnancy by being reminded of it on a daily basis . <repeated> all i feel is until it happens to you , and <allcaps> you </allcaps> are forced to make these kinds of choices , you should not judge anyone else for the choices that they make .	0

because feeling safe is not the same as being safe . the people on the airplanes of september 11th felt safe just before the terrorists took over . the virginia tech victims felt safe before they knew about the killer that managed to slaughter 32 innocents . everyone involved in any major massacre has always had plenty of reason to feel safe right up until the killings took place . but the fact remains that none of them were safe . if they were safe then they would not have gotten killed . feeling safe is nothing more than a false sense of security that can be destroyed at any given moment . i ' d rather not be a victim of some violent incident and mistakenly believe that it could never happen to me . i ' d rather actually being safe as opposed to just feeling safe . feeling safe is just that : just a feeling , it ' s not anything tangible , it ' s not something that will do you any good if somebody decides that you are going to be their next target .	0

( in hebrew , this literally reads , “ he lets hang his tail like a cedar . ” ) a cedar is not a tiny insignificant tree as the hippos tail is when compared to other tails on other animals . you insult the intelligence of the ancients to imply that they could not either name or describe a hippo by name which as you yourself admit , was a common animal in that part of the world . as for leviathan being a crocodile or an alligator , again , are you telling me that their hides are invulnerable to arrows or spears and cannot be punctured at all ? would those animals stand firm and not flee from men who stood up to them with spears , javelins and arrows ? not on your life . “ though the sword reaches him , it cannot avail ; nor does spear , dart , or javelin . he regards iron as straw , and bronze as rotten wood . the arrow cannot make him flee ; slingstones become like stubble to him . darts are regarded as straw ; he laughs at the threat of javelins . ” “ on earth there is nothing like him , which is made without fear . ” leviathan “ played ” in the “ great and wide sea ” ( a paraphrase of psalm 104 verses 25 and 26 — get the exact sense by reading them yourself ) . and do you think that the writer who describes this creature is just throwing in the part about smoke , light and fire coming coming forth from its mouth for creative license ? job 41 : 18 - 21 18 by his exhaling a light does shine , and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning . 19 out of his mouth go burning lamps , and sparks of fire leap out . 20 out of his nostrils goes smoke , as out of a seething pot or caldron . 21 his breath kindles coals , and a flame goes out of his mouth . i fully admit that i am incapable of either explaining or proving what this animal was , but i know it is not any known animal which currently exists . and isaiah might have given us the answer as to why this animal no longer exists since we know it was invulnerable to human attacks in the ancient world . isa 27 : 1 in that day the <allcaps> lord </allcaps> with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent , even leviathan that crooked serpent ; and he shall slay the dragon that [ is ] in the sea .	0
actually , breeding horses and donkeys is not an effort to create a new species . where did you get such a thoughtless idea . and neither is interbreeding lions and tigers . however , you do not seem to be aware that neither ligers or tigons are sterile . they are capable of breeding with each other or with either of the parent species . and then there are polar bears and brown bears , which can and will interbreed if given the opportunity . and the offspring are perfectly fertile .	1

originally posted by symbiote a ) in medicine , the use of antibiotics , the understanding of what causes resistance , and what kind of treatments can be used to avoid resistance . the knowledge that virii ( like the bird flu ) can easily evolve over time to spread through different organisms , resulting in preventative measures to prevent deadly diseases effecting humans . ender krum : this seems to be micro , not macro , evolution . i am still having trouble combining micro and macro evolution . could someone address the following statement from wikipedia on micro - evolution ? " typically , observable instances of evolution are examples of microevolution ; for example , bacterial strains that have become resistant to antibiotics . because microevolution can be observed directly , both pro - evolution and some anti - evolution groups agree that it is a fact of life . " walking - fish : the mechanisms of mutation , gene flow , genetic drift and natural selection that work for microevolution below the species level , also work at the macroevolutionary level ( why would not they ? ) . however , some biologists put more emphasis on the role of mutations of developmental genes at the macro level to push the changes that lead to higher taxons . the most often quoted example here is that of stephen j gould , who proposed that the jaws evolved in fish as a result of such genes causing a shift in the position of the first 2 gill arches relative to the others so they could be free to evolve as jaws . i think that these drastic genetic changes would be the only discernable difference in the mechanisms between micro & macroevolution . as for the " typically observable " examples of evolution , i ' d like to add that observed speciation events cross the threshold between micro & macro . also , lineages in the fossil record are easily observable . genetic markers are , likewise , observable evidence of macroevolution . so it is perfectly legit to say that we can indirectly observe macroevolution by way of this kind of evidence .	0

no . you are missing the point . al wants you to think all we have to do is stop emitting co2 . he wants you to fear something that he knows how to fix . <repeated> so you will give him prizes for being a genius and solving the problem . al gore is a shyster . <repeated> just like michael moore . documentary , my <allcaps> x <elongated> </allcaps> ! tell me , what has caused the global warming on mars ? . <repeated> jupiter ? i understand the temperatures there have been rising more in the past few years than before . think it could be resulting from their industrial age ? . <repeated> and he ' s pretty much a hypocrit about what we should do . check the stats on his personal home . check the emissions rating of his antique private jet . he claims to be doing his part by leading a carbon neutral life . <repeated> which means he merely paid for permission to continue polluting the earth with his inefficient means of private transportation and his energy sucking home . he claims that sea levels will rise 20 feet or so shortly , yet he bought a million dollar condo near sea level in california . we should all decrease what we spew into the air ( and what we send to landfills ) . this fact does not diminish the lies told by al gore . <repeated> the ones that got him an oscar and a nobel peace prize , both of which become more meaningless each year . gore , a shyster <url> <url> 1 . the film claims that melting snows on mount kilimanjaro evidence global warming . the government ' s expert was forced to concede that this is not correct . 2 . the film suggests that evidence from ice cores proves that rising co2 causes temperature increases over 650,000 years . the court found that the film was misleading : over that period the rises in co2 lagged behind the temperature rises by 800 - 2000 years . 3 . the film uses emotive images of hurricane katrina and suggests that this has been caused by global warming . the government ' s expert had to accept that it was “ not possible ” to attribute one - off events to global warming . 4 . the film shows the drying up of lake chad and claims that this was caused by global warming . the government ' s expert had to accept that this was not the case . 5 . the film claims that a study showed that polar bears had drowned due to disappearing arctic ice . it turned out that mr . gore had misread the study : in fact four polar bears drowned and this was because of a particularly violent storm . 6 . the film threatens that global warming could stop the gulf stream throwing europe into an ice age : the claimant ' s evidence was that this was a scientific impossibility . 7 . the film blames global warming for species losses including coral reef bleaching . the government could not find any evidence to support this claim . 8 . the film suggests that the greenland ice covering could melt causing sea levels to rise dangerously . the evidence is that greenland will not melt for millennia . 9 . the film suggests that the antarctic ice covering is melting , the evidence was that it is in fact increasing . 10 . the film suggests that sea levels could rise by 7 m causing the displacement of millions of people . in fact the evidence is that sea levels are expected to rise by about 4 0 cm over the next hundred years and that there is no such threat of massive migration . 11 . the film claims that rising sea levels has caused the evacuation of certain pacific islands to new zealand . the government are unable to substantiate this and the court observed that this appears to be a false claim . stay tuned as the uk high court ' s final ruling may impose additional restrictions on teaching an inconvenient truth in classes . they may also point out additional inaccuracies as we all know they only scratched the surface above . <url> <url> <url> <url> <url>	0

certainly , because with calm empathy you can casually address such a matter simply because the struggle does not pertain to you personally . to be able to put into question the love of another human being is simply not only alarming in nature , but damning to the very definition of love , equality , and freedom in creation of man . <repeated> and to trump this as a question of morality only serves as a mask to curtail the prejudice objections one personally has to a ceremony , right , and relationship that person will not even be personally affected by . <repeated>	0

genes transfered horizontally are as subject to selection as anyother form of gene . once intergrated into the recieving genome they are simply one more heritable element and if they alter the phenotypes ( many are either neutral or even inactivatee ) then of course they are subject to selection . why do you think otherwise ? remember that horizontal transfer is a rare event roughly on a par with ordinary mutations .	0

hey thanks for the " edited / out of context sermon . " peter was rebuked for interfering with the plans of god . oh . . . christ never said to throw the sword away . . . " put it away " means put it away in the sheath . mark 8 : 31 and he began to teach them that it is necessary for the son of man to suffer many things and to be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes , and to be killed , and after three days to rise again . 32 and he spoke the word openly . and taking him aside , peter began to rebuke him . 33 but turning around and seeing his disciples , he rebuked peter , saying , go behind me , satan , because you do not mind the things of god , but the things of men . 34 and calling near the crowd with his disciples , he said to them , whoever desires to come after me , let him deny himself and take his cross , and let him follow me . 35 for whoever desires to save his life , he shall lose it . but whoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel , that one shall save it . 36 for what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world , yet damage his soul ? 37 or what shall a man give as an exchange for his soul ? 38 for whoever may be ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation , the son of man will also be ashamed of him when he comes in the glory of his father , along with the holy angels . matt 26 : 47 and as he was yet speaking , behold , judas came , one of the twelve . and with him was a numerous crowd with swords and clubs , from the chief priests and elders of the people . 48 and the one betraying him gave them a sign , saying , whomever i may kiss , it is he ; seize him . 49 and coming up at once to jesus , he said , hail , rabbi . and he ardently kissed him . 50 but jesus said to him , friend , why are you here ? then coming up , they laid hands on jesus and seized him . 51 and , behold , one of those with jesus , stretching out the hand , drew his sword and struck the slave of the high priest and took off his ear . 52 then jesus said to him , put your sword back into its place . for all who take the sword shall perish by a sword . 53 or do you think that i am not able now to call on my father , and he will place beside me more than twelve legions of angels ? 54 how then should the scriptures be fulfilled , that it must happen this way ?	1

to a small extent , this happens already . oftentimes ( 21.3% , u.s. ) , a woman decides to have and abortion because she cannot afford a baby ( from here , source ) . this is in effect removing members of society who are non - productive ( babies produce virtually nothing useful until they mature by about 10 years ) . and poor families are less productive , since they are often on welfare . granted , this is a rather harsh perspective , but the effect is the same : in the u.s. , there are about ( 21.3% x 1.31 million ) 280,000 less people every year who would have likely grown up in a poor home ( assuming the child would not have been adopted ) . forced contraception / abortion is seen as an effective way of solving poverty in some parts of the world . <repeated>	0

some apply logic , some do not . so much for contradictory thinking . what evidence do you have that suggests logic exists outside of the human mind ? hold the mythology , please . from infidels . org - the concise oxford english dictionary defines logic as " the science of reasoning , proof , thinking , or inference . " logic will let you analyze an argument or a piece of reasoning , and work out whether it is likely to be correct or not . it ' s worth mentioning a couple of things which logic is not . firstly , logical reasoning is not an absolute law which governs the universe . many times in the past , people have concluded that because something is logically impossible ( given the science of the day ) , it must be impossible , period . it was also believed at one time that euclidean geometry was a universal law ; it is , after all , logically consistent . again , we now know that the rules of euclidean geometry are not universal .	0

in other words , you think a supreme court decision should only shut down the debate if it ' s a decision you agree with . roe v . wade and heller do share some striking similarities . for example , scalia stated in heller : " nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on long - standing prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill , or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings , or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms . " however , the text of the constitution has as much to say about such restrictions as it does about abortion . i have heard that scalia has been criticized for making such a statement because there is no clear historical precedent dating back 200 years of banning felons from owning firearms . so neither the text of the second amendment nor tradition justifies such restrictions . it is an example of judicial lawmaking .	0

the 2020 global food outlook answers this as it says that a greater demand for vegetables will correspond with higher prices of vegetables in developing countries . many articles acknowledge that starving people cannot afford much of any of the food for sale around them , and a greater demand for meat does not necesarily mean a decrease in demand for vegetables as populations grow globally . since increasing meat consumption is irrational because it will not feed the poor and it will do even more damage to the environment , again , the solution proposed is to support the initiative for developing nations to become more self - sufficient in growing plant foods for themselves .	0
he has a bit more basic information about r.a.t.e. on his webpage . to also has a page critiquing r.a.t.e. methodology . sorry , i know you are looking for more substantial personal feedback , but this is some good basic information that does not rely upon a billion links . you also might consider asking this question on iidb . org , and maybe dr . meert will respond to you personally . more importantly , let us not get hung up on analyzing the raw empirical data only . for example , if i use a stopwatch to time how long it takes for light to flood the room after i turn on the switch , and i come up with 0 . 0 6 s , you can not argue with my empirical data : i timed it at 0 . 0 6 s . the fact that human response time is comparatively lousy and that a stopwatch is awful for extremely short time intervals is more significant that the stopwatch reading itself . this is the primary error that r.a.t.e. makes .	0

the point is that these laws against cheaply manufactured handguns are no more than economic restrictions on gun ownership . this is similar to old english laws which established actual economic requirements for owning weapons . gun accidents happening due only to poor construction are rare . this is just another form of people control , keeping weapons out of the hands of the poor so as to lessen their importance in politics .

you are distorting my view . i certainly do not think that i am " god " or that everyone has to revolve around my standard . however , i do think that morality has to have a rational basis behind it . this is my particular rational basis . my moral code certainly is not my own invention but is based on the moral codes which i have often heard expressed by others , as well as the moral code of the german philosopher kant ( often referenced in secular moral discussions ) . most people from childhood are taught morals at least partly from the same points of view i use . after all , how often have you heard the phrase " how would <allcaps> you </allcaps> like it if that happenned to you ? " or something similar . that is essentially the same as my basis of morality . it seems to be very common . even many religions use a similar basic appoach - " do unto others . <repeated> " . of course , we all differ enough in our psychology that we might have some differences in how we would expect to be treated by others . so , this approach that i present would not lead to the same result in all people . also , this approach depends on the capabilities of the person to see the big picture and to be able to fully see things from the other person ' s point of view . since we are imperfect in these skills , it certainly helps to have moral discussions , moral mentors , etc . who can enlighten us in various situations . it is not a perfect method but at least it is not arbitrary since it is based on reason . note that the famous german philosopher kant gave a similar secular moral code in his categorical imperative : " act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law " . your view does not seem to be based on reason but on a blind trust in a religious authority that tells you that a particular set of rules is right and must not be questioned . for those of us who do not hold the same beliefs as you , those rules often seem quite arbitrary . sometimes some of the reasons behind those rules are illucidated , often not . sometimes the rules are the same as those derived by secular reasoning , sometimes not . personally , i would prefer an imperfect moral code that at least is based on reason and is refineable to one that is immovable and based on arbitrary standards . on a last note , there certainly could be moral codes that are based neither on religion nor on some version of the moral code which i have presented . if so , i would be quite interested in hearing them .	0
what is your point ? should we revert to old laws that allow for slavery ? over the history of mankind we have struggled to understand god . god has revealled part of himself to us , but it is difficult for the limited mind to know the unlimited mind . the us had laws enabling this ? does this mean you were not a democracy then ? when you were a child , and had total awe of your parents , and believed what they told you , were you less of a person then ? surely you understand that what your parents taught you then , was a part of you growining and becoming an adult . god for instance calls himself ' father ' . this is not because he has ' male sex organs ' but because it is the best way for us to understand his relationship to us . likewise , the jews made laws in order to best live according to god ' s will . they did make mistakes , and got bogged down in the law . jesus came ( as promised by god ) and liberated us from the entrapment we had set for ourselves . surely you do not advocate that we should return to a strict observence of mosaic laws ?	0

so , you consider a so called theory which allows a 10 billion year gap out of an alleged potential 10 to 20 billion year age for the occurrence to be the most credible theory ? and is actually supported by evidence ? if they have any evidence , why the 10 billion year gap for wiggle room ? no wonder you accept evolution as a rational possibility . the fact is , they have no credible evidence at all as the big bang is nothing more than a deduction based on theoretical mathematical equations which can neither be confirmed or verified . just read the link and consider the factors cosmologists must consider before even doing the math required to come up with an age . now consider how skewed the outcome must be if they are incorrectly interpreting even one aspect of the info they are relying on for the equations which result in an age . any errors in those results and the out equations are useless . thus , the 10 billion year gap in their cosmological guessing game . how old is the universe ? now consider the creator of the big bang theory itself . edwin hubble proposed the big bang as a possible beginning of the universe based on the perceived expansion of the universe from a tiny central singularity back in 1929 . since then it has become the holy grail of the scientific community in explaining how time and space began . <url> this theory is made up of nothing more than the imaginings of a young cosmologist back in 1929 yet has been adopted as a rational theory by the scientific community as if they are a bunch of lemmings who will grasp at any explanation which does not claim that god did it .	1

so you plan to move out of n.y. in a year or two , and own a gun ? why not now ? n.y. laws are sticker than most , but not all . you want to teach your kids to shoot ? better do it now , later on it will probably be harder . well if you do not think that gun control is the most important issue in the world and you totally agree that people should be able to own guns , but yet you have no problems with states making it mandatory for gun owners to have permits , thats almost a contradiction of terms for someone that says their pro gun . i may be wrong but is anyone saying or implying total gun freedom ? what we are saying is , to many laws on it no more . 35 - 40 years ago we did not have all this b.s. about it , you wanted a gun you went and got one ( in other words very readily available ) walk down the street with one and you did not have a s.w.a.t. team on you . we have seen to many gun rights taken so yeah every time a new policy or amendment comes along we are antsy about it . so if you support every amendment made to the constitution pertaining to guns , than i submit your not to interested in owning a gun . and for the record : gun toting bandits ( out here we say bandito ' s ) are jumping out of every ally { figuratively speaking } . but the pro - gunners know that if the anti - gunners had their way , only the bandito ' s have guns .	1
well , i see that hunter continues with his intentional ignorance . even though it has been explained to him on several occasions , he still chants his " evolution is only a theory " mantra in hopes that his audience will be as ignorant as he . yes , evolution is a theory . in science that means that it has been tested and accepted as essentially correct . evolution is a theory just as gravity is a theory - several in fact ; newtonian gravity , general relativity , and quantum gravity . none of those theories actually work in all situations . but for all practical purposes , evolution has been proven . that ' s easy since evolution has been observed and the theories are build on the facts of those observations . you will notice that hunter has not proven any of his assertions . he just knows that there are talking snakes , and magical beings that make people out of dirt . sure - go ahead and start with the bible so you can get the mythology of two different creation stories , an impossible flood , and such fantasies as a man being swallowed by a whale or the any human would know about a god that wagers with satan , out of the way . not only will you find no proof to support the bible , you will not evern find any evidence .	1

1 . from what i have learned , different locations breed different surroundings . human ancestors were migratory pack animals . where they went , they encountered new types of pressures , causing them to change over time . 2 . different selective pressures . different areas can lead to different pressures . some mutations also occured etc . things like that . evolution does not <allcaps> have </allcaps> to occure non - stop if there is equilibrium . not everyting is always changing , as far as i learned . barring mutations that cause significant changes over a lot of time , apes , chimps , monkies would not really change all that much . there ' s no real pressure to do so . they are already well - adapted to their surroundings . actually however , there really is not that much difference between some of the great apes and humans . take the bonobo chimps , for example . they have 98% the same <allcaps> dna </allcaps> as humans . they are the closest to homo sapien . 3 . niches . related to above . crocs , for example , do not evolve that much because they are a very successful animal design and they found a place in which they can thrive for generations with little to no changes . other animals can do the same . 4 . as well , humans did not come directly from apes . we all evolved from a common ancestor who did all of the above . <url> here is a time line of hominid species <url> <url> evolution does not lead to a higher species , as well . there is no hierarchy in nature . each species is equally as well " evolved " depending on it ' s environment etc . a human is no more evolved than a chimp or better than a chimp . evolution does not lead to progression , but merely change . it ' s not getting better toward some high standard . humans just like to think so .	0

here ' s an interesting one : lipoprotein lipase s447x : a naturally occurring gain - of - function mutation . brief reviews arteriosclerosis , thrombosis & vascular biology . 26 ( 6 ) : 1236 - 1245, june 2006 . rip , jaap ; nierman , melchior c . ; ross , colin j . ; jukema , jan wouter ; hayden , michael r . ; kastelein , john j.p. ; stroes , erik s.g. ; kuivenhoven , jan albert abstract : mdash ; : lipoprotein lipase ( <allcaps> lpl </allcaps> ) hydrolyzes triglycerides in the circulation and promotes the hepatic uptake of remnant lipoproteins . since the gene was cloned in 1989 , more than 100 <allcaps> lpl </allcaps> gene mutations have been identified , the majority of which cause loss of enzymatic function . in contrast to this , the naturally occurring lpls447x variant is associated with increased lipolytic function and an anti - atherogenic lipid profile and can therefore be regarded as a gain - of - function mutation . this notion combined with the facts that 20% of the general population carries this prematurely truncated <allcaps> lpl </allcaps> and that it may protect against cardiovascular disease has led to extensive clinical and basic research into this frequent <allcaps> lpl </allcaps> mutant . it is only until recently that we begin to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie the beneficial effects associated with lpls447x . this review summarizes the current literature on this interesting <allcaps> lpl </allcaps> variant . this one provides rather good protection from hardening of the arteries . or this one : <allcaps> applied and environmental microbiology </allcaps> , may 1995 , p . 2020 & <hashtag> 8211 </hashtag> ; 2022 vol . 61 , no . 5 0099 - 2240 / 95 / $04.0010 copyright q 1995 , american society for microbiology emergence of nylon oligomer degradation enzymes in pseudomonas aeruginosa <allcaps> pao </allcaps> through experimental evolution <allcaps> irfan d </allcaps> . <allcaps> prijambada </allcaps> , <allcaps> seiji negoro </allcaps> , * <allcaps> tetsuya yomo </allcaps> , <allcaps> and itaru urabe </allcaps> department of biotechnology , faculty of engineering , osaka university , 2 - 1 yamada - oka , suita , osaka 565 , japan through selective cultivation with 6 - aminohexanoate linear dimer , a by - product of nylon - 6 manufacture , as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen , pseudomonas aeruginosa <allcaps> pao </allcaps> , which initially has no enzyme activity to degrade this xenobiotic compound , was successfully expanded in its metabolic ability . two new enzyme activities , 6 - aminohexanoate cyclic dimer hydrolase and 6 - aminohexanoate dimer hydrolase , were detected in the adapted strains . <url> we thought it would take roughly a million years for bacteria to evolve enzymes capable of digesting nylon ( because the compound is so different than any they were able to digest ) but it took less than a century . barbarian observes : it ' s all real <allcaps> dna </allcaps> . some of it just does not code for anything . but some parts of non - coding <allcaps> dna </allcaps> ( which you call " junk " ) has other functions besides coding for proteins . .	0

you mean like allowing for , and funding , comprehensive sex education , birth control , and parenthood planning ? those things alone would reduce the number of abortions significantly . however , we live in a nation that would fire a surgeon general for stating that masturbation is healthy . we live in a nation that believes that sex is only of the penis - vaginal penetration variety . we live in a nation where most pregnancy are unplanned . we are so busy " protecting ' our children , that we do not realize that the best protection is information .	1
in a way , taking rights away is an american value since we have prescribed methods for doing it . for instance , we have legislatures which posess authority to remove a large number of what you likely consider to be rights . here are just a small number that come to mind : 1 ) right to murder 2 ) right to own slaves 3 ) right to rape 4 ) right to abusing children 5 ) right to vote 6 ) right to smoke ( if you are under 18 ) 7 ) right to drink ( 1 8 th amendment ) <happy> right to engage in certain activities in public 9 ) right to drive as fast as one wants 10 ) right to dump dangerous chemicals in the nearest river the list goes on really . the fact is that you do not object to taking rights away in principle , you only object to taking away those rights that you wish to retain . that is quite inconsistent . where do you get the idea that one has a right to perform an abortion anyway ?	0

no . we do not agree . for one thing your faith is not a theory . creation as described in genesis is a myth , in fact , two myths . furthermore , a scientific theory does not mean " wild guess with no foundation " . that seems to be what you want the word to mean . in science a theory is an explanation for observed facts that has been tested . you see , a theory is predictive . i will give you some examples of scientific theories . the germ theory of disease , the theory of gravitation , the heliocentric theory , tectonic theory , atomic theory . moreover , you are wrong that science cannot observe actual evolution of life . it is done all the time . while it may be debatable that a virus is alive , the recent case of <allcaps> sars </allcaps> making the jump from civets to humans after a mutation is evolution .	0
as far as all observable evidence dictates , the laws of nature are what sustains the universe . there is not one single function of nature that isnt on " autopilot " as it were . that is , no function needed to sustain the universe occurs outside of natural law . what ' s more , nothing that defies natural law ( whether universe - sustaining or not ) ever occurs in observable reality i am glad you responded nu leader . this is this issue that really hits the religion / science divide . as it is , god has been gradually and subliminally coralled in the spiritual realm . there is absolutely nothing in the physical and observable world that is a function of god , or a manifestation of supernatural power . in other words , in the realm of the physical , god has no turf . even if god does exist , he does not ( and by biblical definition , cannot ) physically manifest his being nor the effect of his power this leaves us with the spiritual realm . this realm , whether it exists or not , does affect people . yet this realm is as elusive and intangible as god himself . the same realm that god is believed to abive and reign in , is said to be the same realm that humans enter only when they die . i have many thoughts about the effects of this spiritual realm on reality , but for now i think its sufficient to say that god is limited to the spiritual realm only	0

this is different than stating that abortion is the same , in principle , as killing a born child . we are back on the question of " why would someone do this horrible thing " which pro - life people continually ask and has been answered in many ways by many people . there are many threads on the subject that the fetus did not come into existance by it ' s own choice is really irrelevant . that it did not cause problems of it ' s own actions does not mean that it does not cause problems .	0
catholics have a different belief . the goal is to always save both mother and child . if the fetus dies during the attempt to save both , then that ' s what happens . for instance , with an ectopic pregnancy , the goal is not to kill he fetus , the goal is to save both mother and fetus .	0

i am impressed ! this is a very precise description , in regular english and yes , the deduction in 9 seems presumptious if all we state is god has a " possibility of existence " . how this was cleverly cleared up ( from the same source site ) was simply a trip back to the definition : " greatest possible being " . the " greatest possible being " , by definition , <allcaps> must </allcaps> have a possible existence . in otherwords , we cannot assume that there is a possibility that the greatest possible being does not exist . yeah , it sounds like the whole " proof " is pointless because your premise is already the proof just keep in mind that for the purposes of this proof , god is defined as " the greatest being possible " . as long as that definition is maintained , the proof works . <repeated> does that mean that god exists ? hmm <elongated> . <repeated>	0
it is in the first place unclear to whom the " further harm " is done . but even granting that the fetus dies , it is not clear how the situation is analogous to abortion , because the intentions of not only the man but even more importantly of the pregnant woman are completely different .	0

first of all not all astronomers believe that . all though it is a very long way to the closest star we really do not know how far stars are away from us it is not possible to know . it is an educated guess at best . if you base your beliefs on science you will almost always have to change them so are they really beliefs ? time and distance are 2 different entities . on the other side of the world it is a different <elongated> day . a light year is the distance light would travel in a year if at the speed we have computed it to be on earth . how gravity affects light in space in pure specualtion as almost all of the cosmological theories are . black holes were created to explain the big bang . there are lots of astonomers that are convinced the big bang is a myth . if the stars were created near the earth and then streched out as the bible says they were the relationship of time and distance would be quite different and would explain how light from a distant star could be seen . no one really knows the answer so it is a matter of faith what you decide is true . both are possible according to science . the powers that be in science are atheist and get the most press . this does not make them right by default . there is a very good book on this subject starlight and time if you are interested in what a brilliant scientist who believes in creation has to say . i will be suprised if you are . i have read hawkings and have him on audio and video . to be fair you should take some time and study the opposing view <allcaps> imo </allcaps> .	0

" concise and readable " takes a backseat to accurate . as i said , miller overemphasizes views outside the mainstream of atheism and tries to paint all of atheism with the same brush . in fact , he picks a single atheist to spend three paragraphs on , then moves past his exaggerated claim . and with good reason . marc ' s impeccable reading comprehension strikes again . marc thinks i was responding to a different point , despite the clear explanation of his " citation about atheists using evolutionary findings to support their concepts . " i figure it ' s his latest attempt at a dodge . ignorance and incomprehensible babbling has gotten old to him , apparently . considering atheists do not believe in the supernatural , there ' s nothing else left . now tell me how your truism actually means anything . lewontin did not say to forbid access to the bible or other texts . you simply assume that he said that because you want to build as much of a strawman as you possibly can . see , if you had just quoted lewontin instead of trying to censor his words , maybe you would have understood . . <repeated> then again , probably not . i keep forgetting that your persecution switch is fused in the " on " position . yes , lewontin mentions the new york times . <repeated> the home furnishing supplement of the new york times , in metaphoric comparison to the stage set of the honeymooners . but you do not have a problem with your blatant misrepresentation , do you ? no , no , anything to brainwash the kiddies and advance your delusion of massive conspiracy . <repeated> if miller truly does understand lewontin ' s point , he does a pisspoor job of explaining it . lewontin says to eliminate the irrational and employ the intellectual . frankly , i see nothing wrong with this ; why do you ? the best case you will ever be able to make regarding lewontin ' s claims in this book is that he believes that a certain path to truth is the most effective . you claim that your path to truth is the most effective . once again , we have no reason to believe either one of you over the other based on these statements alone . which dawkins books that promote atheism ( and by atheism , i mean atheism , not evolution ) are required reading in public schools ? cite specific instances and include evidence that the <allcaps> aclu </allcaps> rejected the cases . this coming from the person who omitted so much that i had to elaborate on and quote from the book multiple times ? no thanks , i ' d rather make fun of your whining and your incomprehensible comprehension . oh , you did not read the part where he distanced himself from atheism ? the one where he explained that evolution is compatible with theism ? i guess you missed it . <repeated> it was only , you know , the vast majority of the book . oh , good , i get to do this again ! they are not christians , just like judge jones is not a lutheran . ( your foot should still be in your mouth over that one , but you never learn . ) they are all phonies , are not they , marc ? lucky for marc , he can accurately assess people ' s belief systems without knowing the slightest thing about their beliefs . but i have this " power , " too : marc is an atheist . sure , he says all this fundie christian stuff , but he ' s really an atheist . i know it in my heart because my own belief system , infallible and based upon the teachings of god himself , tells me so . i know , because i know christians , and marc ' s not a christian . he ' s just a big phony . and there you go . <repeated> atheist . clearly , i have correctly labeled you , and you are nothing but a false teacher . pathetic , marc . absolutely , positively pathetic . in other words , marc has absolutely no resolution to this conundrum except to leave us with this oh - so - powerful exchange : marc [ about miller ] : " he ' d think differently if he interpreted the bible the same way i do .

technically , all syllogisms need two premises , first of all . " step two " and " step three " were a dilemma , not separate steps . learn to read . dilemma : you only read scenario 1 , which was : step two - god can create a rock he cannot lift - step three - god cannot lift the rock conclusion - god is not all powerful scenario two was - god cannot create such a rock - therefore , there is something god cannot do - therefore , god is not all - powerful the only case in which god could truly be all - powerful is if he can somehow both create an unbreakable rock and then break it , which defies the law of non contradiction and is thus absurd . thus , the notion of all - powerfulness , which leads to such a notion , is also absurd .	0

i see . so what you are saying is that you are unsure about evolution and wish to explore it . great . then start with one of those unreasonable and dumb arguments and present it . why are you more reasonable and not so dumb ? it ' s easy to do what you have done . i can claim that invisible pink unicorns push the moon across the sky . i can claim that you are unreasonable and dumb because you disagree with me . but it is meaningless unless i am willing to show that i have a pair and can step up and show why i am right . do you have a pair ?	1

i think you sound rather immature . and actually , it ' s tough luck for you , chuzlife . because the law is not on your side . and i doubt women who are exercising their constitutional rights are going to tell you about what ' s going on with their bodies or within their privacy of their relationships with their physicians and / or family members . nor do i blame them one bit . and just to clarify your position for the board , on this " child " definition you keep insisting on . do you mean to use that terminology for a fertilized egg , too ? as in the photograph i shared earlier ? : flutteringeyelashes :	0

your use of language is rather colourful here ( lying propagandist ! ) and smacks of hyperbole . what is being critisised here is bad application of the scientific method in relation to national geographic ' s articles on the nature of relationship between birds and dinosaurs . i think olsen makes some very pertinent points , but at no stage is he saying that evolution does not occur or the possibility that there is no link between any theropods and birds ever . what he correctly draws attention to is poor peer review and less than conclusive evidence to support the hypothesis of the article ' s author . in turn this is a stinging criticism of the ng given its high profile , reputation and claim to being a leading forum for the presentation of science in a popular format .	1

i think the only valid reason for owning a gun is because you want to . every person ( with some exceptions ) has the right to keep and bear arms , why you do it is your own business . giving specific reasons for gun ownership is the top of a slippery slope towards banning certain firearms . while i have specific reasons for owning specific guns , to include hunting , i own some of my guns for no other reason than they are fun to shoot . a humorus side note : i own one gun strictly for fishing , sounds odd but its common practice ( at least in alaska ) to shoot large halibut before bringing them aboard .	0
that clearly went whooshing over your head . it was intended to mock the op .

the purposeful taking of life regulated by the government is something that is decided by the people . the people decide what determines what is allowable and what is not . when it is acceptable and when it is not . this is done in agreement , obviously not unanimous . theses laws are created by the view of society at the time . our society permits the ability to change those laws as our values change . you may call it murder , but you are wrong . there is no logical argument you can present to make your view correct . to suggest that legal abortion is anything else is an expression of your frustration why others do not share your views . there is no logic in your argument it ' s pure emotion and an immature understanding of how to cope with problems that do not go your way . if you think your view is indeed the view that is best for the people then be thankful in the us the opportunity exists for you to effect that . i can assure you though lieing about it , sensationalizing it , bullying people about it is not going to get many people to consider you . please do us both a favor before you go off on a discourse of the rights , or feelings or value of the fetus remember what i said about we as a society decided what is acceptable and what is not . we make these laws for ourselves for that reason , because we do attempt to value life . that attempt does not always satisfy all of the people all of the time , but it never will . i do not need a formula to understand how our society functions nor do i stomp my foot and throw insults or intimidate people who do not see you being right . nor would i justify behavior that from anybody else concerning something of less import would be unacceptable . if you do not like the law , then do something about it . if this is what you deem to be the best and most effective way to do that , i suggest you find a to become comfortable with it .	0

oh ! mememe ! i have an idea ! the museum staff hire ( or possibly abduct ) a few evolutionists and put them in stocks . the visiting kids then come to the gallery to give mum and dad a break for an hour and get to ask the scientists questions about the origin of the earth and why fossils are different from things alive today . each time an evolutionist gives an answer based on science they get pelted with the leftover veg from the dino pit lunchtime display . this way the kids learn an important lesson in how to deal with scientists as well as being good for the environment by putting all that veg the dinos would not eat to good use ! yay !	1

oh . then you are just a dupe rather than being dishonest . your information comes from a moonie . funny that the discovery institute does not mention that . the fact that he decided to study biology with the express purpose of disproving evolution . so he had made up his mind that it was wrong before he undertook to find out what is was . wells was encouraged by the rev . moon . he is known selective presentation of data .	1

oh , it certainly is an issue . martin killias , a swiss criminologist , did find a link between gun ownership and homicide in switzerland . however , my point was to ask you if you would be willing to abide by such regulations . the law in switzerland requires that military weapons kept in the home be unloaded and stored under lock and key . i do not think switzerland is a gun - nut utopia .	1

* * the " methodology " of science is not materialism / mechanism / darwinism , but simply empiricism leading inductively / abductively to hypotheses regarding regularities in causation in nature that can be tested via the predictive experimentation of the scientific method . neither empiricism or the epistemological process of the scientific method are the exclusive property of materialism / mechanism , nor did they originate from within that metaphysic , despite the beliefs of materialist / mechanists to that effect . unfortunately , some 150 years ago , that methodology was set aside , and has remained out of sight , with regard to the hypothesis that is generally referred to as ' darwinism ' .	1

just a guess on my part . but it ' s probably one of the only factors that separates our advanced industrialized nation - - as the only one still having the death penalty - - from savage places like afghanistan , etc . having a doctor allows the self - deceptive veneer that a most uncivilized , inhumane act , about to take place , is somehow civilized or humane . and not the bloodthirsty , venomous , purely vengeful thing that it is . he sounds like a very principled individual to me . with this , yet one more indication that the death penalty system in our country is unsustainable . not only for moral reasons , but because it is not shown to serve as an effective deterrent , and because the overwhelmed system is not supportable , under our american constitution , often punishing everyone involved , even the families of victims . ( i . e . these cases go on for years and years and years and years . there ' s no closure for people . )	0
zoos are indeed a good example . although the environments are made as close as possible to the natural habitats , penguins are often kept in open - air enclosures in temperate or even tropical climates . and there are two critical differences in even the most carefully constructed zoo : the absence of any predators , and the absence of any prey . so why do not the animals quickly / purposefully / nonrandomly cease exhibiting developmentally costly traits which give them an advantage against predators or prey who are not present ?	0

proof that evolution is " right " is not necessary to prove that genesis is not science . genesis is an inspired poem , and contains truth in its message , but it is pretty obviously a work of poetry , like a song . look at the repetition , and all the metaphors ! poetry does not imply fiction . there are many historically valid poems . plus , when read figuratively , genesis poses no conflict at all with science . evolution is not the only science that demonstrates genesis can not be read literally . what about the speed of light from the stars , geology , genetics , comparative embryology , etc . the only stumbling block between science and faith is a strictly literal interpretation . for most of us faith and science work together ! see : songofgenesis . org for more detailed information .	0

yes . it describes an action without ascribing its form to its end result , outcome , whatever but strictly to a cause / s force / s in action . that is why ' selection ' is always teleological . in order to select or choose anything , an end must always be in view . there must always be a volitional discrimination of options based upon a criterion dictated by the desired end . the only time " channel " becomes teleological is when something live [ a human or a beaver , let us say ] intententionally does the channeling . but since it is understood that mechanical forces can also ' channel ' , unintentional , out of simple mechanics , the word channel cannot be called teleological . in the same way , ' sorting ' can be considered non - teleological , hence mechanical , and thus suited to your glossary , because things can be sorted by mechanical forces alone . but ' selection ' always requires volition and awareness . so ' selection ' is always teleological .	0

funny . it is you who have " abso - freaking - lutely " no qualms about forcing gays and lesbians to pony up dough for mr and mrs . john q taxpayers marriage and divorce , all the whie denying them the chance to follow the same course as mr . and mrs . john q . taxpayer . you my friend are a complete hypocrite . either give them marriage or quite taxing them to help yours . on another topic , i find it sad that you were ever given the position of moderator with your hateful and dishonest posts like this one . very glad that it was stripped from you .	1
but the civil war wasn ' t fought for slavery . if you will recall the average northern soldier wasn ' t too fond of blacks , and that is not only sugar coating it , but saying it in the nicest terms possible . the civil war was fought to keep the union in tact . border states still kept their slaves for obvious reasons , the intactness of the union trumped any moral principal . besides , that wasn ' t true even in practice . black soldiers were paid less , had less equipment , had less medical care and were given the worst jobs possible . hardly created equal . it took some time before they could even fight . your argument is a load of garbage to someone who actually has knownledge about the civil war . i will not even go into the reconstruction period and how your so called principal did not even exist .	0
except that that would be the author ' s words , not a direct quote . notice the absence of quotation marks ? special agent newell never said " 17% came from the us " . the author has as much trouble with the stats as you . 17% of the total have been traced to the us . we do not know the percentage of the total that did indeed come from the us but is untraced or untraceable . see the difference ?	1

actually just as many atheist help the needy . of course a person would need to be open - minded to realize it . here is one such atheist charity . if you were open - minded about such things then you would have learned that both bill gates and warren buffett , who have each individually made the two largest charitable donations in american history , are both atheist ( oops , bet that ' s gotta kill your argument , huh ? ) and they can rightly claim credit for spurring many other ultra - rich to also be charitable . ted turner , the multi - billionaire , has also donated millions to others , and guess what grizzly6626 , he ' s an atheist too ! george soros , also a multi - billionaire , financier and philanthropist , has also donated millions and is also an atheist . the list goes on and on . you just do not hear about these people donating because they tend to do these things quietly , and not with a lot of cough <emphasis> religious cough <emphasis> fanfare . did not mean to wake you up grizzly6626 <allcaps> btw </allcaps> - many catholic charities are known to turn the needy away . i have heard many accounts about how when some people first got married back in the 1 9 7 0 s , that catholic charities would not help them out because they were not " good , church - going catholics . " basically because they did not go to church every week ( and put in their money filled envelope ) the church did not consider them worthy of help . you see , it is not because religion makes people morally better than atheism . rather , it would be because churches often organize charitable activities and encourage their members to participate , while atheists , simply have no comparable social structure . it ' s not that churchgoers have a superior moral sentiment , just that because of their increased social structure they naturally have increased opportunity . there are countless amounts of people who are atheist that donate from the heart . they do not ' band together ' into groups like religions do , and they do not advertise their charitable works like religions do , but they donate from the heart just the same . here is a partial list of many such individuals who just happen to also be atheist . but it goes <allcaps> much </allcaps> further than that though . there are a few organizations formed by atheists for the sole purpose of donating to those in need . one such organization is called s.h.a.r.e. - secular humanist aid and relief effort . here is a recent story about them helping those in need . so , when someone ignorant and closed - minded like grizzly6626 tries to convince you that ' only religions ' donate or help those in need , you will now know that it ' s simply not true , and that people from all beliefs , even those that do not believe in god , help others in need and donate from their hearts , because they know it ' s the right thing to do for their fellow man in need	0
oh please dont give me that <allcaps> x <elongated> </allcaps> . <repeated> its so great that you can try to turn that whole statement and point at me being at fault but that in and of itself shows you are at fault because you think that without your way the world would cease . honestly , the world has lived without gay marriage its whole existence . <repeated> so why implement it now ? <repeated> shouldnt that say something about the human race when it steeps so low to want to call homosexuals married couples ?	1

sure . the woman is a person , and individual , sentient human being . she has the same right to control her bodily resources as any other person does . as such , you can no more force her , against her will , to provide bodily resources to an embryo or fetus , than you can yourself be forced to give of your bodily resources against your will . even if somebody is bleeding to death , and your blood can save their life , they still do not have the right to force you to safely give them of your blood . each person have that right to control their bodily resources . if you want to force the woman to remain pregnant , you are forcing her to give of her bodily resources against her will . when you do not insist that everybody else be subject to such requirements , then the argument is hypocritical and misogynistic . and , of course the us supreme court agrees with this , thus ruling that per the 1 4 th amendment of the us constitution , the woman has the right to privacy , to control her onw body .	0

because self - defence , unlike most other ' reasons ' , automatically allows all citizens firearm access , and in most cases allows firearm acess without mandatory training / evaluation . when this occurs , you are much more likely to get misuse of firearms . if you read around you will see that i consider all rights as needing justification . this comes both from my stance as a relativist and as a uk citizen , where there is no formalised constitution . ask yourself this - if a right cannot be justified , why should it be treated as a ' right ' ?	0
would this be considered intelligent design ? to me it would be like winding up a top , loading it with paint , and then letting it spin on paper to create a painting . the process is deliberately set in motion , but the painting itself is random and not deliberate . where the paint falls is not by design , even though the overall pattern would be . anyway , to answer the question , there are lots of people who believe in a creator as well as evlution , so the beliefs are not mutually exclusive . the problem is that christianity depends upon the account of genesis being true . spontaneous origin is mutually exclusive to genesis , but evolution by itself is not necessarily . but evolution poses other problems such as the age of the earth and the existence of dinosaurs that creationists are stumped by . in order to belief in evolution , you must , at the very least , disregard the genesis account . and disregarding genesis automatically invalidates christianity . but it doesnt necessarily invalidate the existence of a creator . pretty wierd , huh ?	0

believing that god doesnt exist or acknowledging the fact that evidence to support the existence of god has never been found does not equate to science being anti - religious or that science hates religion . in fact , the one thing that both science and religion have in common is acknowledging that belief in god is not based on observable evidence , but rather an individual choice to apply faith in something which cannot be seen or proven . on the one hand , religion continually reaches that in order to believe in god , you must have faith that god is real despite a marked lack of evidence for god ' s existence . science concludes the same thing : that people who believe in the existence of god do so solely by faith , despite the lack of observable evidence to back this belief the bottom line is that science does not make religion obsolete by reiterating the fact that there is no evidence for god . religious people also already knows this , and believe in god regardless	0

so the intent hiding behind abortion laws all along was to keep women in the gutter . there was not any legititamte concern for the unborn fetus . it was all about how they could keep women down . tell me then , would someone who supports a ban on partial birth abortion do so simply because they want to repress women ?	0

i think you fail to take into account that for most opposers of abortion , they genuinely feel they are trying to save lives by their opposition . in many cases it ' s not a matter of trying control sexual prermissiveness in society but preventing lives from being killed . disagree or not , you can not separate the anti - abortion message from the fact that it holds to the view that abortion is a form of murder .	0

yes , it seems you never learn , so i have no hope of educating you , and absolutely no intention . since you ask nicely , the answer is " supreme soveriegn authority " , i . e . the fact that governments are established among men to secure their basic rights - - i . e . they not left to individual whims to respect or violate as each pleases , in the model of classic anarchy . states are thus delegated by their people , with the power to to protect these rights through laws . i believe we have gone over this before ; you did not understand it then , i doubt you will now . <repeated> or ever . it ' s still true , however : ignorance is never disproof . if you form your own nation , you can name yourself the sovereign and construe the laws however you choose ; however that ' s neither here nor there .	1

do you have any evidence that this is so ? why would they be totally useless - is it just because you can not imagine a use ? why do you think that a small , quick dinosaur with relatively long arms ( not like the short useless arms of t . rex that could not even reach its mouth ) with three very sharp claws would be useless ? look at this picture . <url> those do not look like totally useless masses to me . the problem is that you imagine that wings sprouted from nothing and must have been useless until they were fully formed as you think they should be . that ' s not the case . they did not spring from nothing as useless masses . they were the front limbs , with quite impressively clawed , grasping hands . they could have even been used for climbing , as is the case of hoatzins that have claws on their wings until they get their primary flight feathers . the could have been used for grasping food that they were able to catch because of the speed assist from imprefectly formed wings . you propose yet another " i just can not imagine how it happened so it must not be true " creationist argument .	1

your stated stereotype of the person in the story is racist . it ' s a racist stereotype and you know it . you are so entrenched in your own world and nothing outside of it , you would not know the " truth " if came into your face like a lemon meringue pie . indeed the court ' s reasoning may have been as racist as your own . indeed , the article describes how the court ' s reasoning was even a surprise to the police officers ' attorney because it was so out of line with what is expected of conduct during arrests . she was not violent and she had an obvious health condition . whatever you think about what she was intending to do or not - - though she communicated quite clearly - - is rather irrelevant given the offense and those surrounding circumstances . i bet this is your opinion <allcaps> any </allcaps> time the story concerns a black defendent and a white police officer . because you are a racist . but it is o . k . for them to repeatedly break the law like yourself speeding again and again , as long as they sign the ticket . what hogwash . actually , there is , my poor addle - minded friend . indeed , you can argue that she was even exercising her responsibility as a citizen with more civic - mindedness than many because she non - violently and patiently refused to sign the ticket . she has a right not to sign . as h.d. thoreau said to emerson in jail , when emerson said to him , " henry why are you here ? " - - henry answered , " ralph , why are you not ? " <allcaps> lol </allcaps> . well that ' s so nice of the copy who let you know . and that ' s very interesting - - " every time " - - archangel . how many times have you been stopped ? and for going how fast ? i am sure it was a lot more than 35 mph ! and you have the nerve to talk about " responsibility " or how this woman was a jerk ? or to call me names ? dearest , i never speed because i take my responsibilities as a citizen so seriously , and i have never received a speeding ticket . were you driving under the influence as well ? how many lives did you put at risk , archangel ? what pomposity ! what hypocrisy !	1
really ? funny , my son , even before i " came out " did not think gays were bad or being gay was bad . he saw hate as being the real evil . <repeated> and you exemplify that just perfectly . <repeated> brava !	1

so there ' s no need to be outraged or question a candidate further just on the basis that he represents the lesser - of - two - evils to you ? you are using the fact palin is there to avoid needing to take biden to task for <allcaps> his </allcaps> statements . if , hypothetically speaking , palin wasn ' t there at all and biden had made the statement alone in a stump speech , you would just leave it at that and not take him to task for his position ? <repeated> frankly , if he ' s the candidate you feel best supports gay rights , i would think this statement on his part would be <allcaps> more </allcaps> alarming , and all the <allcaps> more </allcaps> cause for concern . so biden was against gay marriage there too ? if he ' s against your right to marriage , knowing why might very well give insight into whether he would change on it at some point or actually be anti - gay in <allcaps> other </allcaps> ways too ! frankly , i find this idea of not probing further to at least try to get some insight into motivations on issues to be pretty odd , let alone not criticizing someone for an anti - gay view just because the other candidate is more anti - gay .	0

why conception ? when a mature ovum leaves the ovary , it has every potential of turning into a human being . how dare i stand idly by while that potential life is wasted , unfertilized ? no ; clearly , it is my duty to try to reach that ovum with my seed . god said to be fruitful and multiply , so i am just following god ' s will .	0

well since posting on this thread has died and this seems to me to be the most interesting atheistic theory , i want to get a bit of clarification . first , what do you mean by being allowed to cease providing for it at any age , but never allowed to kill it ? by this do you mean that to cease providing for during the first trimester is not killing it ? is that because it is not alive at that time ? if i follow you ( and i am not sure i do ) should the mother be allowed to have the baby removed at some point during the third trimester , after which it must be kept alive ( and perhaps put up for adoption ) ?	0
well . <repeated> someone has not been following the campaigns for the so - called " protection of marriage " amendments , federal or state .	1
not necessarily . when " life " begins is irrelevant , because flowers and weeds do not have rights yet they are a life form . the thing that determines rights is intelligence . not how much or how little , but whether someone has it at all . a spec of dirt has no intelligence . it will not pop up and say " hey ! how ya doin ! " unless you are on crack . we have actually killed intelligent entities for less than the consequences of carrying out an unwanted pregnancy . we hunt , and we go to war . even though i do not agree with war , i do agree with hunting , and i myself hunt on occasion . however , that is off topic . the point is , carrying out an unwanted pregnancy can have devastating effects , and those next 18 years could hold her back from her life . its awful how she will have to liver her life . if she gets an abortion , the embryo does not ( to quote another opinion ) " mentally exist " . now , hunting is really only done for recreation , and maybe a good meal . they would have been almost just as well off if they went to the local taco bell . sure , they ' d prefer hunting , but its really only done for fun and exercise . i , myself , value an animal over an embryo at its current stage . the only reason i do not completely think an animal is worth more is because that embryo has a chance of becoming a human . then again , the animal does mentally exist and has full awareness , and the embryo is really just a sitting cellular watersack with no organs .	1

yes , it ' s very subjective . i was using evil as an example that was incorrectly used on the website . even though evil is subjective , you can still be evil . ( you can do evil to take away your goodness , but the only way to make yourself colder is by removing your heat , not adding " cold " ) no , but there is proof that it ' s that way , which can be seen through a combination of personal experience and the experiences of others . the classic example about seeing that the earth is round is that of the horizon . why do ships appear to sink as they approach it ?	0

so did you read his mind to determine exactly why he bolded that particular set of words ? you are the first mind reader i have encountered here . and considering your disdain and rejection of science from cosmology to biology what does it matter if something is terrible science . according to you all science should be terrible . why do you attempt to use a tool which you reject as being useful ?	1
is there a defined number of posts he could make in the other threads so that you would consider them " finished " ?	1
and i was correcting you . if you are offended then that ' s the breaks .	1
first , are you not forcing your beliefs on me when you lobby for , enact , and support a law that legalizes an act that i see as murder ? second , forcing someone to believe as i do is in no way the essence of christianity . god gives choices ( which is another debate ) to man . we must simply choose right or wrong . jesus wants us to influence , not force . jesus said to his followers in matthew 5:14 - 16 , " you are the light of the world . a city on a hill cannot be hidden . neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl . instead they put it on its stand , and it gives light to everyone in the house . in the same way , let your light shine before men , that they may see your good deeds and praise your father in heaven . " if i truly believe in jesus as my lord and saviour ( and i do ) , then i must follow his command to influence ( not force ) the whole world . it does not do any good to only preach to the preached .	0
actually , if you bothered to pay any attention whatsoever , it actually goes against your point entirely . just because <allcaps> wsm </allcaps> and i were both in " heterosexual " style relationships , does not change the fact that both of us are indeed homosexuals and therefore proves that homosexuals do indeed have children , planned or not . mine too was kind of a suprise . i was on the " pill " but was also taking antibiotics at the time and for anyone who does not already know , antibiotics will completely cancel out the affects of the birth control pill . i was <allcaps> not </allcaps> aware of this at the time and low - and - behold i ended up pregnant with my son . p . s . just for general information , i was not taking " the pill " for birth control reasons . not all women who are prescribed it are even sexually active at all . the birth control pill contains synthetic or naturally dirived female hormones , which for some women aids them in attaining a more regular period . many women atheletes are prescribed birth control because being extremely athletic can disrupt , postpone or completely do away with a woman ' s natural cycle . taking birth control helps to " normalize " female hormone levels . such was my case .	0
state - level governments are largely worthless , in my opinion . it is complete absurdity to allow constitutions to be ammended based on the vote of the people . people as a whole are largely biased , uninformed , and care only about the wellbeing of the majority , persecuting the minority any chance they get . simply put , the will of the people is too often to benefit the majority and persecute the minority , and this can be seen everywhere throughout history . the will of the people often deserves to be not only ignored but put in a little can and crushed , for the voice of the people is not the voice of the people at all ; it is the voice of the majority . i cannot know the intentions of the creators of the california goverment when they created their judicial system , but if it was anything like the intentions of the founders of our nation , then the judges are doing precisely what it was intended to do : judge laws which persecute the minority , assuring that the government cannot engage in such persecution without a whole lot of effort and not having to fear retaliation . if the point of judges was simply to give in to whatever pesecution 51% of the population wishes to force upon the other 49% , then our government would be tyrannical in no time . you may feel that a bad precedent was set , but i consider it a far worse precedent for a judge to have given into the majority , to ignore what he feels is a destruction of freedom and equality , simply because it is popular to do so . i would also recommend that the california constitution be judged based on the fact that it likely has conflicting statements , for example , it may state that everyone must recieve equal protection under the law , of which this is a clear denial . the california judge would probably not have the authority to refer to the federal constitution ; it would have to be taken to the federal courts for that .	0
that ' s because its sophistry . its an inherent contradiction and it simply means we do not have the capacity to understand it . another more common example is that the assertion that the universe cannot be endless , and yet as far as we know it is . trying to understand it is for us humans like an ant trying to fathom the theory of relativity . damn are we ever conceited as a race . <repeated> we seem to think that if we can not understand something , it cannot be . we also tend to think , in every generation , that we have achieved somehow the pinnacle of progress .	0
yea , and so is gardening . both are " murdering " living things . both do not mentally exist . a strand of <allcaps> dna </allcaps> is the only difference , which is not very much .	1
well , that just means i am a more capable lump of cells now than i was when i was first conceived . i started doing what most embryos do when they are first formed , and that is develop . i am still developing . i can not seem to stop it . i think my body has stopped growing ( in height anyway ) , but seem to keep filling my brain with more and more experience . the point i was trying to make is that since there is a continuum of existence between conception and death , there is no line you can draw ( save birth , which may or may not be considered an arbitrary boundary to personhood ) that would constitute some sort of a change in what you are . i started as one cell and continued to grow and develop , which i am still doing now . if i am a person now , i was a person when i was the zygote . if we are going to talk about aortion in this society we should be honest about it and not try to mince words when it come to killing a baby . i am not " anti - choice " but i think we should honestly recognize that an embryo is a living human individual that dies when it is aborted . that thought turns most people off so they have to make themselves believe that an abortion is not a killing since the embryo wasn ' t a person . logically , it is a killing . a life was ended . the question then becomes , is it murder ? i do not happen to think that , but it is really quite subjective anyway .	0

oh , do not be so hasty bear in mind that at the scale upon which bacteria operate , molecules are significant physical structures . the bacterial flagellum , for instance , is an outboard motor constructed directly out of proteins , which are in turn directly , physically translated via <allcaps> rna </allcaps> from <allcaps> dna </allcaps> sequences . the physical shape of the folded molecular structure of those proteins is what makes the motor work . so there ' s nothing abstract about the relationship between <allcaps> dna </allcaps> and the organism ' s physical form or abilities .	0
because you people keep wanting one restriction after another after another after another . nothing is ever good enough for you , you always want more than ever . well we do not want to abide by your wishes , gun ownership is a recognized right , and your hatred of rights will not be tolerated . we are not going to just stand by and be painted as the bad guys because you have the mentally disabled belief that banning gun ownership will reduce crime , and anybody who disagrees with you want to see people killed .	0
that is not my logic . my logic states that banning doctors would cause more deaths and our current system does . you are trying to debate that doctors are threatening withour realizing that they have great rewards as well . my logic is to look for the risk and reward and not just focus on one side of the debate . your logic was that since doctors cause deaths then they should be banned if guns are , correct ? then why is not it also consistant with your logic to believe that we should ban food since food causes deaths ? so lets clairfy here , do you believe that guns have a better risk / reward than doctors ? if you <allcaps> had </allcaps> to ban one which would it be ? i await your sidestep of the question . lol , now your comparing the jews to current us gun issues ? why did you choose to do this ? the risk - reward for jews is different than the risk - reward for the us . jews probably would have faired better if the germans used japanise gun control laws .	0

so once again you are steering away from the debate ? i do not understand why your ignoring the debate and going off in a whole new direction even after making this same mistake in your last post . you are still showing that the bible has a flaw in it and therefore your making up your own story about what happened . you are also making predictions about the future based on your own interpretation . i am sure you will not even considered that your wrong about either of these things though i doubt you have any reason to believe in either of them other than you have the idea stuck in your head now . [ quote ] the above fully answers the apparent contradiction you and others find in these passages . the reason you may think i may be presenting information contrary to normative christian teaching is that you have picked a peculiarly thorny passage - something that skeptics of the bible and enemies of god will almost always do . [ \ <allcaps> quote </allcaps> ] it only answers the contradiction after you fill in the blanks with your own interpretation and of course your interpretation is based on your personal views and no facts . all the facts that you can work with are in the bible and as of this moment the bible seems to have a flaw in it . your trying to cover this flaw with a story that you made up . i guess in your mind this makes sense but i do not think many christians would even agree with you much less those of us who look for logic .	0

well then this does not answer my question . if you have 10 doctors for 100 people ( this is just an example ) and only 50 of them have health insurance and each doctor gets paid $100 a year then your health care per capita is $10 ( [ 1 0 doctors x $100 ] / 100 people ) . if you change it to 100 people with health insurance you now have $10 per capita as well because you population did not change . health care costs are shown per capita and not per person insured : per capita health expenditures by country , 2007 & mdash ; infoplease . com so again , if you go from $6,000 per capita per that website given above to say switzerland levels at $4,100 per capita then where did that money come from ?	0

yes chrstians should be disarmed so the " moral " atheists , humanists , pagans who crucified people should rule over us . . . that would give everyone a warm fuzy feeling inside . matt 26 : 1 and it happened , when jesus finished all these sayings , he said to his disciples , 2 you know that the passover is coming after two days , and the son of man is betrayed to be crucified . of course there are valid reasons why christ armed his men . romans 13 : 1 let every soul be subject to higher authorities , for there is no authority except from god , but the existing authorities have been ordained by god . 2 so that the one resisting authority has opposed the ordinance of god , and the ones opposing will receive judgment to themselves . 3 for the rulers are not a terror to good works , but to the bad . and do you desire not to fear the authority ? do the good , and you will have praise from it ; 4 for it is a servant of god to you for the good . but if you practice evil , be afraid ; for he does not bear the sword in vain ; for he is a servant of god , an avenger for wrath to the one practicing evil . 5 because of this , it is necessary to be subject , not only on account of wrath , but also on account of conscience . 6 for on this account you also pay taxes , for they are ministers of god , always giving attention to this very thing . 7 then give to all their dues : to the one due tax , the tax ; to the one due tribute , the tribute ; to the one due fear , the fear ; to the one due honor , the honor . luke 11 : 21 when the strong one , having been armed , guards his dwelling , his goods are in peace . 22 but as soon as one stronger than he comes , he overcomes him ; he takes away his armor on which he relied , and deals out his arms .

so the radiometric data stand : the earth , moon , and older meteorites are all 4 or so billion years old , not just a few thousand . changing decay rates ? another creationist attempt to counter radiometric dates that are incompatible with their young - earth religious position is to claim that decay rates are not constant , thereby throwing a monkey wrench into the calculations . there are at least two problems with this argument . first , it is not at all clear how varying decay rates could result in multiple decay sequences all agreeing on the age of an object . remember , for example , the oldest exposed rocks on earth , dated using different parent radioisotopes ? all five of the decay sequences ( rb - sr , pb - pb , u - pb , th - pb , and lu - hf ) clustered right around 3.7 billion years . if decay rates vary enough to throw off dates by billions of years , why would they vary in exactly the way needed to consistently produce the same results ? second , radioactive decay of nuclei is not comparable to chemical reactions . in chemistry , the rate at which chemical reaction proceeds can be altered in a number of ways , such as by changing the temperature , acidity , pressure , or reactant concentrations . such changes , however , have essentially no effect on nuclear decay . in fact , experimental attempts to alter decay rates have been made , but failed .	1

yes , that ' s all true , and it makes complete sense . but in doing this , the court may have created a situation where plaintiffs can argue that california is denying people the equal protection of the laws , by allowing some people to be married to same - sex spouses and not allowing other people to be so married . if that is the argument that the plaintiffs make in their federal lawsuit , this could be interesting . the courts might have to interpret whether allowing some people to be married and not allowing other people to be married violates the equal protection clause of the 1 4 th amendment to the u.s. constitution . and then they might have to decide whether this means that all same - sex couples must have the right to marry , because some of them can be legally married . in other words , this situation may be an opportunity , because no one can argue that this is a case of apples and oranges of same - sex couples being different from opposite - sex couples . now you have same - sex couples who are legally married and same - sex couples who cannot be legally married in the same state , which can be argued to be denial of equal protection of the laws . i do not know . <repeated> it could be interesting . maybe things will not play out this way . we will have to wait and see .	0

to clive14 : darwin never produced a " theory of human evolution " . r - - i - - g - - h - - t . and i am a shakespearean act - -o- - r . darwin ' s book titled " on the origin of species by means of natural selection or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life " sure seems to me to suggest that he had an idea on the evolution of man . darwinian evolution was ( and still is ) inherently a racist philosophy , teaching that different groups or " races " of people evolved at different times and rates , so some groups are more like their ape - like ancestors than others . darwin believed , for instance , that the australian aboriginals were considered the missing links between an ape - like ancestor and the rest of mankind " . many indigenous peoples died because of darwinian evolution , so do not give me such rubbish that darwin never did a theory of human evolution . darwin ' s evolutionary scheme went something like this : evolutionary ancestor - - > australoid - - > negroid - - > mongoloid - - > caucasoid . perhaps you best go home and check up on your own theory before you post such a remark . and people think that creationists are mis - informed ! this is true of the unscientific use of the word " theory " . in science , " theory " is equivalent to " fact " . there is a theory of gravity for example . is gravity just guesswork therefore ? once again , falsehood . if a theory is equivalent to fact , than why do they have two different things . in science , using you above example , gravity is a fact ( i do not think that there is a theory of gravity , at least it is not in the <allcaps> hsc </allcaps> physics course when we were studying it ! ) . by definition , a theory is an explanation of observed facts and laws . it is supported by experiments upon which it is based , and is confirmed by experiments designed to test predictions based on the explanation . now where in that definition is the word fact either used or implied ? now where , a theory is like a story to explain observed facts and phenomenon . a theory does not mean the idea is " fact " . it is just a story used to explain how some observed phenomenon may have either came into existence , or why and how it behaves the way it does . you mis - interpretation of scientific terms is noted . i disagree . faith is believing something to be true regardless of the evidence . people have faith in the bible . people do not ( or should not ) have faith in evolution . i agree with your definition of faith . bible believing creationists must take it by faith that there is a god , and that the bible is the inspired word of god . evolutionists ( for the most part , i . e . most are atheistic ) , however , must take it by blind faith that there is no god and that the bible is not the inspired word of god . your last sentence struck me as to how brainwashed some ( or many people ) are in the lie of evolution ( microorganism into people evolution ) . for one , evolutionists must take it by blind faith that stuff has evolved , i . e . there is very few fossils that support this notion . the fossil record dismisses and is a crushing critque of darwinian evolution . for example , dr ronald r . west ( paleoecology and geology ) stated in his article " paleoecology and uniformitarianism " which was published in compass , vol . 45, may 1968 , p . 216 : " contrary to what most scientists write , the fossil record does not support the darwinian theory of evolution [ microorganism to man ] because it is this theory ( there are several ) which we use to interpret the fossil record . by doing so we are guilty of circular reasoning if we then say the fossil record supports this theory . " in addition to this , dr david b . kitts ( school of geology and geophysics , department of history of science ) in his article " paleontology and evolutionary theory " in evolution , vol . 28, september 1974 , p . 467 says the following : " despite the bright promise that paleonotlogy provides a means of " seeing " evolution , it has presented some nasty difficulties for evolutionists the most notorious of which is the presence of " gaps " in the fossil record . evolution requires intermediate forms between species and paleontology does not provide them . the gaps must therefore be a contingent feature of the record . " what they are saying is that the fossil record does not show evolution , but we will continue to believe it even though we have no proof of the theory of evolution ( i . e . microorganism to man evolution ) . evolution has been proven . creation has been disproven . this whole argument is over stubbornness on the part of people with faith who cannot bring themselves to accept that evolution has been proven and creation has been disproven . four words that always gets an evolutionist into trouble , " evolution has been proven " . if you refer to what you call " micro - evolution " ( to which creationists call " varriation within a " kind " " ) than i would agree with you . species change all of the time , but it is important to know that the species never get more complex , they are constantly losing gentic information ( i . e . <allcaps> dna </allcaps> ) and becoming less complex . with natural selection , things lose an ability that will enable a species to survive in an environment ( usually by the way of mutations ) . so since varriation within a kind ( or micro - evolution - always a loss of <allcaps> dna </allcaps> ) has been proved , this is also further evidence to the creationary model . the macro - evolution has not been proven . nor does the fossil record bear out many evidences for this , as many leading evolutionary scientists have ( or are comming ) to realise . creation has not been disproven , as you falsely claim . otherwise , the evolutionists here on this forum would be able to hammer the creationist arguments , and thus far they have not . this fact alone is evidence against you . they only gain an advantage when we start having silly debates on things that i do not know much on , nor have studied up on , such as geological features for an example . we have the same rocks , so of course the evolutionists are going to claim that in many cases i am wrong - as they have a different interpretation to me . or they have a different story to explain who a land structure got there to me . both stories are based on the evidence , so it is hard to get through to one another . sadly , time restricts me from continuing .	1

again , please review the definition of an atheist humor cannot be observed by apparatus that test the physical realm . it is an abstract and intangible quality . so is beauty , artistic ability and pleasure . yet these things exist and are as real to an atheist as it is to a theist . an atheist does not need a devine revelation to appreciate intangible qualities or account for their existence . they can be detected through mental processing , and communicated so that others can agree on the quality and identify it when it is present . being an atheist does not preclude belief in the existence of intangible and abstract things . it just precludes the belief in god and a spiritual / supernatural realm	0

well , given that your term is a fabrication of the creationist ' s mind , i suppose you are right . evolutionists do not actually exist . therefore you could assign whatever traits you wanted to them , including dishonesty . evolutionist is a term designed to cast evolution as a faith based notion . the problem is there is no faith in evolution , faith is a belief in something with no proof . evolution has proof . therefore it cannot be a faith based idea . a typical creationist attack is to misrepresent their target by creating a strawman of it . they then declare it is wrong and by proxy , the actual theory wrong . it ' s fundementally weak , but inline with a belief that is scientifically unsound .	0

well , in the case above , it was step - by - step . first , an existing enzyme was modified to a new use , and over time , became refined to work better and better . this is the way evolution works . nothing is de novo ; it ' s always a modfication of something else . second , a mutation produced a regulator that only allowed the enzyme to be produced if the substrate was available . again , this was refined by natural selection over time . in the end , the newly - evolved system was irreducibly complex , because all three parts have to be present for the system to work . and do show us your numbers proving that such processes can not produce new information . if you do not know how , i ' d be pleased to show you how a mutation changes the information in a population .	0

well let me put it like this , i consider it your duty because if you do not protect yourself then you basically shift that responsibility to someone else . not only is this incredibly selfish , but 9 out of 10 times the ' protection business ' gets outsourced to the state . this in itself it dangerous because when people decide that a third party like the state ( which has no real accountability ) has control over their lives it can all to easily lead to a situation where the state becomes tyrannical . more people have been killed by their own government than by any foreign government .	0

so you are admitting openly that what is a normal occurrence within the human species is offensive to you . that you find repulsive the very intimacy expressed by your own parents that led to your own existence . do you see how that innate bitterness against the normal and right feelings that have led to the healthy continuation of the human race is ultimately anti - humanity ? why do you hate the normal propagation of our species matt ? can not you see that if you were given the power to recreate the world in your image , then the world would cease to exist within one generation ? no matter how pro - gay you are , how can you be so anti life in good conscience ?	0

you still do not get it . how many times does it have to be explained to you ? populations evolve . no change of any kind in a single organism is evolution . evolution is the changes in the hereditary ( genetic ) makeup of populations over time . you continue to display your ignorance . evolution is a process that takes place in living things . just because all of science contradicts your childish belief in mythology does not mean that all science is evolution . because cosmology contradicts your mythology , it must be evolution . because astronomy contradicts your mythology , it must be evolution . because geology contradicts your mythology , it must be evolution . and that is why creationists are such scary people . their morality comes from a book and threats of eternal punishment . the fundamentalist christian morality is so shallow that they are unable to conceive that others can actually have a higher morality based on self respect . and that is meaningless babble . evolution is a process that has been observed whether you like it or not . it is not a moral statement nor is it a statement of faith . it does not deal with government , laws or culture . whining about it will not change it .	0

yes , but adam wasnt created with hereditary information or from sperm and egg cells . adam was the prototype . any subsequent humans should be born following the fashion in which adam was made . otherwise adam could have been shaped like a goat and still bear human children , because god could have formed him into whatever shape or lack of shape he wanted , yet put the genetic information in him to produce human offspring . why should adam ' s children look like adam ? wouldnt adam ' s children be born the way adam was created , or not ?	0

it is rather disrespectful but do not think it is limited to one side . most protestors on both sides are not great . one thing did spark my interest , and it is said often , why is it a " hard decision " if you are pro - choice ? is it hard because you do not know if you want a baby around or not ? could not this decision be just as hard before being pregnant ? even so , why link it to going to an abortion clinic ? you hear " it was hard enough to come to this decision in the first place " but how is going through some protestors making this decision harder ? no one would admit to this but it is statements like " it was hard enough to come to this decision in the first place " that make me believe that someone realizes it is wrong and the struggle that makes it hard is whether or not to do the right thing or do they thing that would benefit you the most . and in that case , i agree . <repeated> that can be a tough decision .	0

a soul has a consciences , it can be emotionally moved from different states of being . this is how the bible can say ones soul is moved ; saddened ; joyous . etc . i think therefore i am . meaning a soul is emotional and so it really has no body . the soul is what we ask the lord to preserve . 1 peter 1 [ 9 ] receiving the end of your faith , even the salvation of your souls . hamburger does not have a soul , it is dead meat . people eat brains and all the pieces of an animal . no soul . the soul is consciences . under some conditions it can return , not after death or before a brain though . we know that to be impossible . fetuses do not get emotional ; there is no mind to speak of . no soul there to trouble . if you ? re on a machine and a doctor determines your brain is dead , the soul is not there . the body could see hell or heaven and there is no emotional effect . no soul for that . read the bible . don ? t listen to fools ; you ? re a person with a soul . use it .	0

really ? if " nature " meant for all things to reproduce through heterosexual methods then maybe all other forms of reproduction would not exist , hmm . they would have been " eliminated " because heterosexuality is far superior . think again . the majority of organisms on this planet reproduce using binary fission ( bacteria dividing ) , asexual reproduction ( there goes your " individual gratification argument ) , and zygotic reproduction . none of these things require sexes of any type . even animals that have " normal " sexual reproduction can reproduce using a process known as parthenogenesis , in which only a female is required to produce offspring ( turkeys and lizards do this ) . if homosexuality is not natural or is inferior , then why do we see examples of it in nature . the bonobo ( closely related to the chimpanzee ) exhibits heterosexual and homosexual activity in both genders in the wild , and the bonobo and humans share a very common ancestor . look , you can not say that one way of reproduction is " the standard " since it is clear that different species reproduce in a variety of ways . you also can not say that homosexuality is a disorder if you follow your previous logic that what is " natural " is valid . also , you said that heterosexuality is superior because it has a " greater purpose " . by implying that something has a purpose , you stray from the realm of science by assuming a teleology . if you want to assume that things were given " purpose " by some higher being , that ' s fine , but you will have to stick to religion to defend your argument . in science , it is impossible to assume a purpose . for example , what is the purpose of a river ? to flow to the ocean ? to carve a canyon ? to carry sediment ? you can say what something is good at doing , or what it does , but you cannot say what it was " made " for ( purpose ) without implying some grand design that can be easily provided by your local religion . as for hetero and homosexuality , it can be said that heterosexuals are better at producing offspring than homosexuals . does that automatically make heterosexuality superior based on the arbitrary criterion of number of offspring produced ? so in the eyes of a value system that believes that something is valued higher that creates more offspring or " life " , heterosexuality would be superior . but in the eyes of science and reason , your argument does not hold water .	1

among the icons ( idols ) of modern mysticism there is one that reigns supreme . it is the myth of evolution . we scoff at the gods of the anchient pagans as if we were untouched by their superstition and yet we mystify our science with the likes of darwin , the high priest of natural selection . darwin taught a fable that started in a warm little pond and through a process that has became known as gradualism ( minute changes over eons ) all life arose out of a primordial soup . life is not chaotic it is orderly and requires replication . without this you just have a lot of chemicals mixing in an infinite variety . the reason that life must be derived from life ( biogenesis ) in the minds of most is that this is the only way we have ever seen it happen . " you can imagine anything you like but you can only understand the truth " as newton said . now if amino acids are the mirror image of nucleic acid sugars and this in true of all living things then we are limited to this as fundamental to life . this in my opinion is the fundamental first step and it cannot happen peicemeal , it all has to happen all at once . one more thing , evolution is a biogenesis theory and actual evidence for abiogenesis is rare and fragmentary just as it is for every other aspect of the single common ancestor model .	0

the definition of manslaughter is when one ' s actions , which end up killing someone , display a reckless disregard for the dangers of the situation . that ' s not a proper legal definition , but it ' ll do . now , you want to argue that pro - lifers would be forced into the counterintuitive conclusion that <allcaps> all </allcaps> miscarriage is manslaughter , and thus their position is ridiculous . i am saying that they would only be forced to admit that a very small portion of miscarriage is manslaughter , and a portion that they would probably be willing to make a case for . i am not saying " miscarriage is not manslaughter , " but only " miscarriage is not always manslaughter . " for example , if a woman took perfectly good care of herself and did nothing dangerous , but had a miscarriage anyway , she would obviously not have committed manslaughter . if a woman had one drink with dinner , but she was carrying a very unhealthy fetus and it died , then she would not have committed manslaughter , because that was not reckless . i pointed out the " you - should not - be - drinking - and - having - unprotected - sex " argument as a position somebody might hold , but i think that it would probably be judged as unrepresentative of the definition of manslaughter . so obviously , miscarriage cannot be manslaughter in the sense of " every instance of a is an instance of b .

actually , not at all true . the organisms of the cambrian look little like modern animals . it is only the major phyla that are recognized by the derived characteristics . for example , the cordates first arise in the early cambrian , along with primitive inverebrates . you can safely say that no animal living today looks much like any living then . for example , there were no amphibians , no reptiles , no insects , no birds , and of course , no mammals . your shotgun approach is not actually worth answering in any detail . it is not even your work .	0

i am not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you , but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species . the canid species , specifically the gray wolf , or the canis lupus which the domesticated dog is an extremely close relative of , differing from it by at most 0.2% of mtdna sequence . the evolution of the domestic dog the earliest remains of the domestic dog date from 10 to15 thousand years ago21 ; the diversity of these remains suggests multiple domestication events at different times and places . dogs may be derived from several different ancestral gray wolf populations , and many dog breeds and wild wolf populations must be analysed in order to tease apart the genetic sources of the domestic dog gene pool . a limited mtdna restriction fragment analysis of seven dog breeds and 26 gray wolf populations from different locations around the world has shown that the genotypes of dogs and wolves are either identical or differ by the loss or gain of only one or two restriction sites22 . the domestic dog is an extremely close relative of the gray wolf , differing from it by at most 0.2% of mtdna sequence . in comparrison , the gray wolf differs from its closest wild relative , the coyote , by about 4% of mitochondrial <allcaps> dna </allcaps> sequence14 ( fig . 4 ) . therefore , the molecular genetic evidence does not support theories that domestic dogs arose from jackal ancestors24 . dogs are gray wolves , despite their diversity in size and proportion ; the wide variation in their adult morphology probably results from simple changes in developmental rate and timing 25 . link to source site : <url> here ' s a lineage graph : <url> and what fossil records can you show that one species of animal has evolved into another species of animal ?	1

you need to learn what a metaphor is , if english is your first language you must have been dropped out of school as a baby . when the researchers say plants " know " they are near their genetic cousins , they do not mean they have a conscious awareness of it and deliberately alter their growth patterns . that is , it is a specific physical response to a specific physical stimuli , and the plants could be made to do the same thing by the presentation of the same stimulus in the absence of any other plants . of course , you are not interested in testing things , because that would be too materialist for you . you just prefer to skim articles and fail to understand metaphors , that ' s true " psychical science " .	1

jurassic theropods like compsognathus had hollow bones . <url> therepodian dinosaurs show clear general skeletal affinities with modern birds such as long limbs , hollow bones , foot with 3 toes in front and 1 reversed toe behind and a long ilium . coelophysis , from the late triassic was one of the first theropod dinosaurs . deinonychus and oviraptor from the late triassic to the cretaceous were bipedal advanced theropods , larger , with more bird - like skeletal features : semilunate carpal , bony sternum , long arms and reversed pubis . striking detailed similarity to birds . there is a gap in the fossil record here although protoavis could belong here , unfourtunately , the fossil is poor . archaeopteryx from 225 ma , shows a mosaic of reptilian and avian features , with the reptilian features predominating . the skull and skeleton are basically reptilian ( skull , teeth , vertebrae , sternum , ribs , pelvis , tail , digits , claws , generally unfused bones ) . bird traits are limited to an avian furcula ( wishbone , for attachment of flight muscles ; recall that at least some dinosaurs had this too ) , modified forelimbs , and - - the real kicker - - unmistakable lift - producing flight feathers . archeopteryx could probably flap from tree to tree , but could not take off from the ground , since it lacked a keeled breastbone for large flight muscles , and had a weak shoulder compared to modern birds . ( wellnhofer , 1993 ) s . santensis from 138 ma was a better flyer than archaeopteryx . it had a short trunk , claws on the toes , flight - specialized shoulders , stronger flight - feather bones , tightly folding wrist and short hands . a not yet named bird / dino from 131 ma has a reptilian pelvis and legs , with bird - like shoulders . the tail is medium - length with a fused tip . then there ' s hesperornis , ichthyornis , and other cretaceous diving birds . there are many fossils . their skeleton is further modified for flight showing fusion of pelvis bones , fusion of hand bones and a short , fused tail ) . it also still had true socketed teeth , a reptilian trait . there are others and this is by no mean exhaustive . this is just to show that there are very good transition lineages . although no modern birds have teeth , chicken bills can be induced to develop teeth , indicating that chickens still retain the genes for making teeth . there is also an intriguing fossil microraptor gui that has flight feathers on both the front and back legs . <url> i can provide more info on any of these if you wish . references wellnhofer , p . 1993 . das siebte exemplar von archaeopteryx aus den solnhofener schichten . archaeopteryx vol . 11 , pp . 1 - 47 .

there are a few slight problems with that theory . first of all the evidence fits perfectly with that book you speak of . if predicts that all creatures came about suddenly and completely formed . this is all we have ever observed . the earliest creatures - according to your theories dating - had incredibly formed eyes etc . and no ancestors among the fossils it also predicts that animals will produce the same kind of animals , this is all that has ever in the history of the world been observed . + it predicts the heavens will show a perfect order and can be used for signs and for seasons and for days and for years . that is all that has ever been observed in the history of the world . it predicts that recorded human history will be less that 1 0 k years . that is what we observe . it predicts that man has always been intelligent and ancient language and buildings confirm this . it predicts that billions of fossils will be found in rock laid down by water all over the world , this we have observed . it predicts there will be pathways in the sea , this is so . it predicts that the heating of the air will create wind and this is so . it predicts that the sea is the source of rain and it is so . it predicted 800 years in advance that the messiah the king would ride in to erusalem on a donkey to the exact day . that he would be crucified and his side pierced with a spear and cry out my god , my god why has thou forsaken me ? and it was so . it was predicted the ones who crucified him would cast lots for his garments and they did . that three days later he would rise from the dead and he did . that <allcaps> dna </allcaps> mutates does not prove anything other that it mutates . it is almost always harrmul or fatal and has never been observed to change one kind of an animal into another . that the species that adapt to their environment survive and those that do not die is a self evident truth not evidence . about as intellectually stimulating as saying most things who fail to survive die . fossils exist . now that is a brilliant statement . why not say , water exist , or sand is ? all dating methods are based on circular logic . if the date agrees with the theory it is correct , if not it must be contaminated . it is based on an assumtion of the quantity of some radioactive substance in a material at some time in the past and how much has decayed when compared to the rate of decay gives us a date . fortunately we already knew the earth was very old or evolution could not have occured . we know how old fossils are because of the rocks they are in and how old the rocks are by the fossils in the rocks . if the 2 are in the wrong place then we know there was an overthrust which is basically a miracle from god which is allowed because evolution needs it . life forms in the millions so therefore it must has started out as a random bunch of chemicals that created itself on a planet that created itself and evolved into the millions we see now . another brilliant deduction . you are on a roll . believe our eyes . oh you must mean all those times you are walking down the beach and trip all over the lobe finned fish coming on shore for the first time . or the thousands of times we have seen a lizard with half a wing or a beaver giving birth to an armadillo . yes , seeing is believing . you present a brilliant argument . how could anyone argue with your brand of logic ? that would be senseless .	1

the founding fathers were afraid to trust the common people with the right to vote . they did not want mob rule and chaos .

' property ' , in those days , also included slaves , of course , and half of the founders were slave owners . <repeated> the maintenance of power in the hands of the elite was further strengthened by who could vote . in 1787 , there were about four million people living in the 13 original states . but only about four percent of them , it is estimated , could vote . excluded were the one million slaves , the two million women , anyone under the age of 21 , and all non - property owners .

well i think that the geology of the planet would influence everything . from religions to morals and scientific progression . because long ago on our planet europe not only thought the world was flat and they could fall over at the edge into an abyss but europe generally did not have knowledge of the asian cultures until the silk road was active . if the asian and european cultures were not so greatly distanced from each other history would have been greatly changed to the extent that compared to our world would be pretty loopy	0

well . <repeated> i do not think it ' s a light choice for anyone . ( although i ' d imagine , for someone who might be developmentally disabled , for example , it might not mean as much . and i suppose some may not care at all . ) i do not think it ' s a decision women necessarily struggle over , either , however . nor should they . for many women , the course of action that they need to take is quite clear . that is , whether or not someone ' should ' have a difficult time with this decision , i do not agree . and , i do not think women ' s motivations in getting abortions , or their personal behavior <allcaps> ito </allcaps> becoming pregnant are anyone else ' s concern . or even if they do have an abortion blithely <emphasis> . ( distinguishing from policies about public health education . ) i just think people have to do what ' s right for them . finding that or reaching a decision - - well , people are different and have different lives . they have different understandings of biology , different health issues , different relationships , different economic positions , different religious views , or none at all . the circumstances around the pregnancy , different . i do not agree with the " potentiality " issue either . if someone <emphasis> is not there yet <emphasis> , they are not in existence , period . i think there ' s just an understandable human reaction to the beginning of life being taken . it ' s not " potential " life . it ' s life all right . but there ' s no individual except in our imaginations . to me , viability , sentience , the development of the nervous system and the brain , and the experience of pain in a fetus during the third trimester begin to mark the ethical boundaries . but those , too , as indicators , are not absolute . and the woman comes first . it ' s between her and her physician . it ' s not my job to judge whether she suffered appropriately enough or not . and i do not think anyone should have go through any demonstrative motions one way or the other for the anti - abortion camp . it ' s none of their business .	0

and i would like to know why that is . i asked the question in post <hashtag> 2 </hashtag> and got no answer . are laypersons lacking in intelligence so much that it ' s hopeless for them to be on the same communication level with scientists ? since they share the same society , put their pants on one leg at a time in the same way , eat , sleep , and share economic processes in comparable ways , it seems to me it would be beneficial for them and laypersons both to understand each other when they use identical terms .

actually the apocrypha is made up of pre - christian texts , and late 4 th century is a bit of a stretch for the new testament , certainly all its component texts were widely accepted by the 2 nd century . i do not whether it is " generally accepted " that the text was altered , it seems to me that you are projecting your own views based on the hypotheses of some scholars on to biblical scholarship in general .	0

uh . <repeated> yeah ? is there some other way than evolution this can happen ? evolution encompasses speciation which results from evolution taking different paths when populations are separated by some factor in their environment or geographically . are you saying you believe that the species have all somehow resulted from a common genome yet at the same time rejecting evolution as an explanation ?	0

whether or not the 2 nd amendment was written to provide for the protection of the states from a foreign invasion , or border dispute , or civil war , it is clear that the objective of the 2 nd amendment is to address the basic provisions and control required to form a militia reporting to the president . one of the provisions to form a militia is explicitly stated in the 2 nd amendment as the unrestricted right of the individual to own guns . at that time in our history , when a militia was formed , it was expected that individuals would bring their own gun ( s ) to the militia . that provision is <allcaps> the implicit purpose </allcaps> of the right of the individual to own guns . within the 2 nd amendment , there are <allcaps> no other implicit </allcaps> , <allcaps> nor explicit </allcaps> purposes pertaining to the unrestricted right of the individual to own gun ( s ) . in other words , the 2 nd amendment does <allcaps> not implicitly </allcaps> , <allcaps> nor explicitly </allcaps> suggest or expand its purpose beyond what it required for a militia , and the control of a militia . the 2 nd amendment does <allcaps> not </allcaps> provide an individual the right to own gun ( s ) for the <allcaps> purpose of </allcaps> providing for : food , self - defense , target practice , a hobby as a collector , or fun . <repeated> therefore , <allcaps> any other purpose or reason </allcaps> for the possession of guns that has been attributed to rights under the 2 nd amendment is based entirely upon thoughts and purposes that were <allcaps> not in the minds of </allcaps> the founding fathers when the 2 nd amendment was written . the founding fathers knew many people required guns to provide for food , income , and home - defense . yet , the founding fathers did not separate the purpose of the unrestricted right of individuals to own guns for a militia , from the <allcaps> sole purpose </allcaps> of owning guns for the creation of a militia . the founding fathers did not write the 2 nd amendment in a manner that would even suggest that the right of an individual to own guns had purposes beyond a militia , that would provide for : food , self - defense , target practice , a hobby as a collector , or fun . <repeated> we may therefore conclude that , any reason or purpose for an individual owning a gun , <allcaps> other than </allcaps> for a militia , is not provided for under the 2 nd amendment , and that current gun laws for private ownership of guns is mistaken . justifications or reasons to provide individuals with a right to own guns for a purpose or reason other than a militia , would have to be based on some amendment , other than the 2 nd amendment , to determine if any such right exists for individual gun ownership exists . that the founding fathers did not write all amendments with the explicit and specific rights of individuals for every condition and circumstance is self - explanatory , as the size of the bill of rights and the constitution would be enormous , and the founding fathers would still be busy writing the bill of rights and a constitution if that was the case . however , the founding fathers were very careful in their use of words and phrases , and in the logical composition of a constitution , and that they decided not to specify other purposes exist that justify individual gun ownership , beyond a militia , in the 2 nd amendment . that decision would appear to be intentional . although it might ideal to understand all that the founding fathers had in mind , when the constitution was written , it must also be understood and concluded that what was the basis for a rational giving the founding fathers reasons to create an amendment , and chose specific terms , phrases , and specifics , may not exist today , nor even be of any importance . for example , individuals need not carry guns from their home to where our troops will gather . today ? s ? militia ? provides for the a militia ? s need , and an individual ? s need for guns . what the founding fathers once wrote with respect to an individual possessing a gun for the purpose of a militia and the remainder of the 2 nd amendment requires revision or elimination .	0

the question is illogical . by declaring the existence of an all powerful god then saying god cannot do something is not a comment on his powerfulness but rather the direct representation of his nature . your question by its very statement does not test wether or not god is all powerful but wether or not god is comprehensible . see another thread for that topic . the statement that god is all powerful defines his nature . to state then that he cannot do something outside of his nature as proof of the non existence of his nature is circular in logic .	0

ah , i see . your reasons are secret reasons . on a debate forum , about gay rights , you oppose it based on . <repeated> well you will not say ! nice debate . who ' s really playing the game here ? i have already listed on a number of posts why it ' s not constitutional . since you missed it ( it ' s only the first post in the thread ) for gay coupes right to be married ( or the same legal status ) 1 . human rights with regards to legal classifcation and the benefits therein are desired by comitted consenting adults of the same gender . 2 . it ' s a contract between two consenting adults . 3 . a contract that does not violate anyone ' s legal rights or cause any significant ill effects to the public welfare . it ' s unconstitutional to allow one group of people access to marriage rights ( hetero couples only ) , and not allow it to female / female and male / male couples when they are obviously lobbying for it in significant numbers . it ' s now a public issue on a significant scale . of course , maybe if you had a <allcaps> reason </allcaps> for objecting to gays being treated equally with regards to the rights of marriage , we would understand not only why you are reluctant to back your claim , but why your reason is also not constitutional . you can call it games , i call it justifying my position while pointing out how opponents of gay rights , such as yourself , really can not make any reasonable justification for their desire to restrict human rights , other than saying " well i want to " . <repeated> or in your case . <repeated> " sh <elongated> . <repeated> it ' s a secret " . you know what we call it on the debate forum when one side refuses to present or rebut arguments ? losing the debate . i realize winning and losing . <repeated> i . e . being right and being wrong are not concepts found in religion , where anything goes . <repeated> but out here in the real world actions have consequences , and words . <repeated> yes , imagine that , have specific meanings . you verbally support a movement that restricts human rights , yet will not give us reasons for your position . i find that appalling . yet you are content with labeling me as " playing games " . how ironic . - mach	1

again your failure to understand what science is and how it works . whatever your apostle tells you , science can not deny that something you may have seen is true . it can deny that it is not science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation . most especially , if the observation can not be repeated by another , then it is not science . science can make no assertion as to what you saw . you may think it is wonderful , but <allcaps> lsd </allcaps> had that effect . how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific . actually , it ' s sad .	1

i see a subtle distinction here . creationism is concerned with the spiritual origins of people .

what else is new ?	0
actually it would not . since there is no rational , believable evidence for creationism , it would not be any more believable if evolution were disproved . as an example , i dare you to start a thread in an appropriate forum and give us tested evidence for a global flood as depicted in genesis . good luck .	0
but the point is why are there relatively few creationists . the reason is that the creationist position cannot be defended in open debate . that is why creationist boards censor opposing views . on boards where creationists are not protected there are few .	0

please , i beg you , stop trying to jam the world into your " creation " account through reason . you just will not get anywhere through reason , if your first choice is to believe the bible ( any religious works ) as truth , and go from there . what you just said is " [ adaptation ] would be mutation by natural selection , not evolution " first , the adaptation refers to the adaptation of the species . a population of wingless beetles survives . the missing wings is the mutation , and is not caused by anything other than a mutation , it ' s not a result of their being winds , or there being a god , it ' s just a mutation in the gene code . the gene for the wings can dissappear into the endless gulf of other discarded mutations since those organisms that carry it will most likely die off before reproductive age . it can also be left in the <allcaps> dna </allcaps> sequence , unused , and not active , unless some other mutation activates it .

( note the key word " also , " which admits that it ' s human ) . as for the rest , this is more of the sort of " defensive rationalization " i talked about earlier , i . e . when people find it more rewarding to self - righteously defend their wrongdoings and thus shirk their responsibility to others , than to shoulder the burdens to those they have harmed , and thus they act in self - absorbed narcissism and sociopathic dissociation , while likewise waxing arrogant in self - deceiving affirmation of their own " brilliance " and other superiority to do as they please , by simply denying said consequences however obvious - - illustrated here , by simply calling a fetus a " parasite " and thus daintily strutting off away from one ' s obvious duties to it , despite admitting it ' s also human . however , a human being forced into dependency on another for its life , is not a " parasite , " but a <allcaps> victim </allcaps> , and thus has the right to aid from the ones responsible for that dependency . since you have admitted that it ' s human , then the remainder is plain ; it also has the right to aid from the one responsible for its dependency , i . e . the man and woman in question who proximately caused it to be in its dependent situation through their willful actions in full knowledge of that risk . here , the doctrine of strict liability would apply , in that normal sexual contact carries the inherent risk of pregnancy . this doctrine already applies to men , and should likewise apply to women who choose to abort in spite of their responsibility to the prenatal human in question , created and made dependent on her for its life through her intentional actions .	0

i believe that the vast majority of people , if they are well - informed about responsible sexuality , have access to contraception , and are of reasonably sound mind , would much prefer not to experience an abortion and would take precautions to avoid such a possibility . it is rather tiresome to hear careless and irresponsible talk of whorish women who seek to become pregnant solely so that they may exercise their right to an abortion . i have never met such a woman . to be sure , there are unbalanced individuals who are riddled with guilt over sexuality and these individuals are incapable of being sexually responsible . i do not associate with such people and since i have never encountered such a person , i must believe that this sort of person comprises a very small minority . but with the amount of bluster and piffle to the contrary , i must wonder whether or not such blusterers have any connection at all to what really is .	0

the sun was crucial in the evolution of most life on the planet , but it may not have been the main cause of the very beginning of life . there are hypotheses that energy necessary , chemical catalysts available , carbon , nitrogen , hydrogen , but not oxygen apart from being part of the water molecule . there are tectonic activated hot springs and chimneys in the deep sea . there is an availability of sulfur , heat energy , and the triggering of a sulphur based metabolism . it was internal energy from up welling and down welling of hot magma which in turn was fuelled by core radioactivity . some even speculate that the very centre of the core may be pure uranium . however , there is no need to debate the second law of thermodynamics . it is a ruse by magical creationists who deliberately and in my opinion deceptively make earth a closed entropy system . cuchulainn ps : fundies have an obligation to show why the fires of hell are exempt from the 2 nd law . i already know the answer . hell is imaginary and imaginary things do not gain entropy .	0

we americans do not care the government of the uk now under the control of sharia law hates freedom . america is a constitutional republic where the bill of rights secure our freedom . i seem to recall you brits coming over here and demanding we lay down our guns and it did not go so well . and neither will it go well for any us politician ' s that try it as well . america has no reason to listen to people in the uk about gun control and now knife control when its shockingly clear that criminals can still get any gun they want . not to mention the fact that history has shown that time and time again what happens when the government wants its citizens to turn in the tools of freedom what happens . " god grants liberty only to those who love it , and are always ready to guard and defend it . " - daniel webster " government is not reason . it is not eloquence . it is a force , like fire : a dangerous servant and a terrible master .

" - william lloyd garrison # " if gun laws in fact worked , the sponsors of this type of legislation should have no difficulty drawing upon long lists of examples of crime rates reduced by such legislation . that they cannot do so after a century and a half of trying that they must sweep under the rug the southern attempts at gun control in the 1870 - 1910 period , the northeastern attempts in the 1920 - 1939 period , and the attempts at both federal and state levels in 1965 - 1976 - establishes the repeated , complete , and inevitable failure of gun laws to control crime .

well that may be your contention , but medically that is not necessarily true . maybe being gay does not mean you are suicidal or depressed , but there is more of it going on in the gay life than in the hetero . that in itself is a wake up call . depression and suicide are harmful , even if it does not touch you personally . if it were as simple as you say the <allcaps> apa </allcaps> would not be re - evaluating " reorientation therapies " would they and with positive critiques too . you would not have prominent gay activists like camile paglia deriding the gay community for being malcontent when those unhappy with being gay seek and desire the way to be hetero .	0
you are on some different planet there . science does not need one conclusion or the other . the traditional classification of neandertals has been homo sapiens neanderthalensis , i . e . , in the same species . then genetic work suggested that neandertals were distinct enough to merit being a separate species [ hodges , s . b . , 2000 , human evolution : a start for population genomics . nature ( 7 dec . 2000 ) : 408 ( 6813 ) : 652 - 653 . ] . results since then have been mixed . some <allcaps> dna </allcaps> work indicates a 5% admixture from neandertals ( plagnol v , wall jd , 2006 , possible ancestral structure in human populations . plos genetics @ <url> ) . various fossils continue to suggest some interbreeding . ( note also that a genetic finding of no interbreeding does not conflict with fossilized hybrids - it merely says that any hybrids or hybrid lines ended up dying out before they contributed to any lineages that were successful all the way to the present . ) a finding of 99.5 to 99.9% genetic similarity is what we expect , given the clear similarity of the two groups .	1

we can add to this list , singin ' s desire of criminalizing gun owners who do not report gun thefts in a required time and to lock up all guns in a manner that will prevent thefts . he of course says that does not mean jail , but aiding and abetting and straw sales already require serious jail time . and straw sales is already a federal offense with either 5 or 10 year jail terms . so we are talking about very serious jail terms regardless of what sinjin might say in order to sell the idea . and one more thing the anti - gun forces want but will not say it now .	0

this was pretty much my understanding of how natural selection was viewed before darwin . nonetheless , i think that my point still stands . darwin proposed that natural selection is responsible for the diversification of species . this pre - darwin concept denies this . my understanding is that anti - evolutionists refused to accept that natural selection could have led to the diversification of species . until recently , when they realized that evolutionary theory could help out in their how - many - animals - could - fit - on - the - ark dilemma ; now they suddenly take an idea from evolutionary science and propose that suddenly all the present species could " micro - evolve " from a few ancestral " kinds " on the ark .	0

i am not arguing that gun control will change the nature of men - though guns may make them more willing and confident to engage in crime . with guns criminals can do even more damage . adding guns to crime is like adding gasoline to a fire - it makes an already existing problem worse . if you think that just as many people die from stabbing and beatings in other developed nations as people die from guns in the us then you need to do more research .	0

is that a trick question ? no , the tabloid and other gutter press keep going on about how bad it is , because they sell papers by fanning fear and hatred , and fear of crime is one of their biggest markets . yes there has been an increase in gun crime over the years , but that ' s largely attributable to increased attractiveness of crime in a society where social mobility has come to a standstill . in any case the number of incidents where firearms are used in crime is still very small , which is why every time someone gets shot it is headline news . guns are incredibly rare in this country , the only time i have seen guns in real life ( other than air rifles ) is on a military base .	0

well , if you do not want a reaction , i would prefer if you not use the word " god " since it is loaded with so many other meanings and conotations than those you say you mean . the choice between our two stances is indeed one between choosing a moral stance based on reasoned analysis ( imperfect as that may be ) and choosing a moral stance based on blind faith ( i . e . not supported by evidence ) in a moral code dictated by a religious authority . you say that my moral code is a code that puts faith only in myself . that is not true . i very openly acknowledge that if i never had input from the outside - moral codes which were presented to me with the reasons behind them - then my moral code as determined solely by myself would have been meager indeed . i have had a wide range of influences which have helped determined my moral code : - the moral codes of my folks during my upbringing - the moral code of the moderate form of roman catholicism i grew up with - the moral codes generally accepted by the moderate democratic part of society - the moral stances of friends - the moral philosophy of kant and other philosophers i have read about i am sure that i could even come up with more than that . from all of those , i have gleaned a morality that works best for me , where my moral code seems to be quite a common one . the moral rules which i accepted were typically the ones which gave the reasons behind them and whose base assumptions i agreed with . the moral rules which i rejected were typically the ones which gave no supporting reasons or whose base assumptions i disagreed with . i suspect that you assume that if a morality is not grounded in religious rules , then it becomes based on selfishness . that is not true . we are all inspired by heroes that sacrifice themselves for others - be they secular or religious ( as jesus himself can be viewed as a hero ) . there is a lot of overlap in morality between secular morality and religious ( mainly christian ) morality - against theft , murder , etc . however , i find too many of the religious rules very arbitrary ( such as the anti - gay propaganda , some religion ' s ban on contraceptives , the idea of the infalibility of the pope , etc . ) that i certainly will not follow religious rules blindly . furthermore , so much of religious morality was determined simply by religious men who were set in the local morality of their time and attached that morality to the religion . even if jesus was divine , it would be very hard today to know how to throw away all the junk morality that was added after his time and extract the pure origin .	0
really ? a lot of people say that every answer makes more questions . in some ways we seem to know less now than we did at the time of newton , in that we are less certain . and newton ' s laws deal with what happens in a vacuum with no resistance , not direct human experience at any rate , my point is that you can not see all the evidence as piling up support for ' science ' as ' science ' is moulded to fit that evidence . not a criticism of science , btw .	0

after . christian fundamentalism is somewhat recent . it arose as a backlash to discoveries being made in science in the 1 9 th century . from one follower of a 7 th day adventist prophetess came " flood geology " in the early 2 0 th century . later , in the renewal of interest in the adequate teaching of science in the u.s. in the 1 9 6 0 s , there arose more modern " creation science . " it began by adopting the flood geology of the 7 th day adventists as the base . creation science begins with the assertion the the creation stories , the flood story , even the mythology of job and jonah , are literally true . creation scientists then attempt to distort the evidence to support this particular version of the bible . when creationists realized that the biological evolution of species does occur , they decided that god had created original " kinds " and then allow hyper evolution after that . creationists call hyperevolution variation in kind .	0
