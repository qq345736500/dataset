as i say , it ' s not a significant matter , so i will not go back and forth with you too much . if you think tom hank , anthony hopkins etc do not prep incredibly hard for their role , include simply be naturally talented and perfect their craft over very long career , among many other way they prep that be just simply different than ddl then i be not sure you can form a proper opinion . if you also lack the understanding that an actor like ddl be require to pull off , not all , but a lot of the role he choose that he do so well in , then you do not understand a lot about actor choose role and cast director choose certain actor . he may be only slightly well in those role than hank and hopkins . but it take that role and movie from good to a classic .	0

i be say this as a comic fan so maybe i be bias . i at least entertain the possibility . i just think the film be not forgettable on a single basis . there have be some relative miss like iron man 2 but even that be more enjoyable to me than most action flick these day . tws be legitimately the best blockbuster action movie i have see in year . it be a complete package . gotg also recently hit some brilliant mark . when be the last time we get a good space movie ? comic be serial in nature and the mcu rock because it adhere to that but the solo flick be still good or for the sake of our actual argument far more entertaining then non nolan dc movie imo . dc very clearly be nowhere near as as marvel what with the show be separate ( but well so far ) and now there be rumor shazam be not even a part of their universe what with a different studio work on it . until they make a movie that be half as true to the comic or have as interesting i would say marvel be easily the king . it ' s also worth note that the one consider the best ( bar im 1 ) be and the new release . they have not have a hint of decline yet so may just blow out the fanbase as well as avenger . avenger be the most true movie to a real comic storyline as we have ever get imo . that should be what the comic genre be all about . do not have to be in tone but in attitude .	0
