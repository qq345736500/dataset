usually it ' s pay through check ( usually fake ) or with wire transfer ( usually real ) . the wire scam need a 3 rd person . the scammer list a more expensive item for a really low price . let us say he put up a 7 0 k dollar porsche for 4 0 k . put up some story on how it ' s perfect run condition just need to get rid of it because they be move out of the country , buy a family car , it ' s just pick up dust in their garage . maybe it ' s not perfect but the damage be only a couple hundred or grand worth and they be cut you a $ 3 0 k deal . point be they do not need it and they be willing to take a major loss on it to sell it fast since half the cash be good than a car they do not need . in come sucker 2 . they see this awesome deal and look past the obviously low price because of the good story . the scammer get them to send the money order to sucker 1 . now sucker 1 be happy they have almost twice the money and only need to do a little leg work push the paperwork to ship it . sucker 2 get a fake track number or some other fake paperwork . they wait for their car and when they eventually do not get it they file a police report . now police sometimes do not mess with money wire since it ' s know to be use for scam and the money gram form specifically say that if you do not know the person it ' s probably a scam . if they do not investigate sucker 2 be out 4 0 k . if they do investigate guess who leave a paper trail ? now they find you and you be out of 4 0 k ( or your car depend on how you look at it ) . you tell them about your car depend on how much they care they can just close the case at this point since they find the money . if they decide to follow it usually they will find that the truck be pick up by a person who do not exist , die , be pay a small amount to pick it up for someone else . you be truck be either in piece be sell for part or ship out of the country to a county be paper work be not a huge deal . that ' s if you ship it in the same state or country and you be lucky . if you ship it out of the country you will be lucky if they do not laugh in your face .	0
