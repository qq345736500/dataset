sam raimi be not direct this . he be only produce . personally i do not think he should direct the last of us but would be willing to give him a shot only if he cooperate with the naughty dog team . i think neil druckmann would make an excellent director for the film adaptation but from what i learn watch the documentary of the making of the last of us be his ability to change the script while shoot the game would not go well with the hollywood suit who normally make the change on script . so i do not think they would pick neil . i hope they find a good director who actually know the content and can make a good video game adaptation .	0

`` i really do not think it ' s just stop - motion ; i also think that a lot of wit , non sequitur , and ambience get kill when you try to make your movie as broadly appeal as possible , both in term of cultural / language translation and audience . the fantastic mr . fox be in many way one of the funny movie that i have see , but it do not have those moment that scream `` `` laugh ! `` `` to an audience full of all type of people . you be never go to be make madagascar money if you be wes anderson , so i feel incline to support stuff that be not afraid to hold some people at arm ' s length in order to more fully resonate with its intend audience ( see also : rango ) . ``	0

that ' s the thing about the prequels , though . you be right , the original trilogy be all kid ' s movie , but the darker sort of kid ' s movie . i think lucas try to make the prequels more of a movie for the people who grow up on the original movie . but i think somewhere along the line , he figure that those people grow up boring . look at the main reason for conflict in the two trilogy : in the ot , the empire be destroy planet and rule through fear . in the prequels , the trade federation be sort of rebelling , and the reason involve trade route . we know that palpatine be manipulate them , but they themselves do not appear to have any real goal .	0

i be say this as a comic fan so maybe i be bias . i at least entertain the possibility . i just think the film be not forgettable on a single basis . there have be some relative miss like iron man 2 but even that be more enjoyable to me than most action flick these day . tws be legitimately the best blockbuster action movie i have see in year . it be a complete package . gotg also recently hit some brilliant mark . when be the last time we get a good space movie ? comic be serial in nature and the mcu rock because it adhere to that but the solo flick be still good or for the sake of our actual argument far more entertaining then non nolan dc movie imo . dc very clearly be nowhere near as cohesive as marvel what with the show be separate ( but well so far ) and now there be rumor shazam be not even a part of their universe what with a different studio work on it . until they make a movie that be half as true to the comic or have as interesting i would say marvel be easily the king . it ' s also worth note that the one consider the best ( bar im 1 ) be consecutive and the new release . they have not have a hint of decline yet so aou may just blow out the fanbase as well as avenger . avenger be the most true movie to a real comic storyline as we have ever get imo . that should be what the comic genre be all about . do not have to be in tone but in attitude .	0
that do not guarantee the movie will be crap at all !	1

i have not see the hurt locker , avatar , or a serious man , so i can not completely say it be a bad decision . i do see district 9 , which i thought be absolutely amazing and be a good example of combine tech with traditional filmography . i have see part of avatar , and it just do not do it for me . imo , it be more hype about the tech go into it than it be about the story , which be essentially dance with wolf in space . inglourious basterds really suffer from the editing . i know tarantino want it to be more , and there be actor who do not have a single scene make it past the cutting room floor . it be good , but the gap be just too obvious . up be touch , but idk if it be any more brilliant than the lion king . of course , i be drunk when i saw it .	0
