i do not disagree with what you have said , but what killed it was the tone was so different . this was more of a comedy . the one liners were hard to stomach . it felt like some one had taken over the franchise compared to the last one , which i thought had the right balance of humor . i have never the comics , but based on the movies , it was the jokes that were so cheesy that made this movie fall flat for me .	0

time travel really makes no sense in any movie . traveling to the future is fine ( and actually possible ) , but traveling back in time always has a few issues . for instance , let us say you go back in time to prevent something from happening . if you accomplish that , then in this new future you have created , your new self has no incentive to go back and time to prevent that thing from from happening in the first place ! now since you did not go back in time to stop that , it does happen ! and on and on it goes .	0

well it has a lot of things going for it for one stephen king is well liked by hollywood , the book series is pretty popular and well known , also you have had successes in the past with doing a fantasy book series all done at once with great success . plus when you do a long shoot like this it is easier and cheaper than many broken up shoots . like i said i think it is an ambitious project , and it ' d be quite amazing if it came out . i ' d be pretty sure that ron howard could at least get the first film and series green lit .	0

one movie will never ruin a boom . i have read a number of directors are fully buying into the 3 d thing and will be making all their movies in 3 d from now on . this sort of disappoints me because i do not need a movie to be 3 d . frankly i enjoy a 2 d flick . i live 3 d every day and sometimes just need to relax and escape with a nice flat movie .	0

it seems like most asians are pushed towards academic careers as opposed to artistic ones . that could be a stereotype , but i believe it true . bruce lee would not have made it in a non martial arts film , he just wasn ' t that great of an actor . harold , from harold and kumar is the only mainstream asian i can picture right now , but he ' s a horrible actor . it ' s hard to blame the studios when their choices are so few .	0

i would not go so far as to say to never watch it again . basically when you love a movie when you are a kid you come to develop a certain association with it . later in life when you rediscover the movie your world view has changed so that association you have created with the movie has dated . but i think that is just an opportunity to rediscover the movie or appreciate it on another level . you are old impression has been effectively torn down but that does not mean you can not like the movie by creating a new connection with it . this does not go for all movies , but do not automatically write a movie off just because it ' s does not feel like the same movie you watched when you were 10 .	0

a lot of people seem to be dissing on the movie because they wanted more references . i feel like if they made too many references , they might as well as just tossed the movie idea and flashed video game references on the screen for an hour and a half . the references were a nice balance with the originality that the movie had and i am glad they did not overdo it .	0

" i really do not think it ' s just stop - motion ; i also think that a lot of wit , non sequitur , and ambience gets killed when you try to make your movie as broadly appealing as possible , both in terms of cultural / language translation and audience . the fantastic mr . fox is in many ways one of the funniest movies that i have seen , but it does not have those moments that screams " " laugh ! " " to an audience full of all types of people . you are never going to be making madagascar money if you are wes anderson , so i feel inclined to support stuff that is not afraid to hold some <emphasis> people at arm ' s length in order to more fully resonate with its intended audience ( see also : rango ) .

no . <repeated> just no . nolan does not know the meaning of humor and that is a big part of what made the original trilogy great . he also likes to ground his films in reality , which is completely opposite of star wars . he also is bad at filming / directing / choreographing physical action so i imagine the lightsaber battles would be terrible . i do not know who would be the best choice to helm star wars , but i know nolan is absolutely the wrong choice .	0

actually no , lasers appear collimated over short distances , but anything other than an infinitely large lasing cavity will produce not perfectly collimated light , which means it acts more like a very narrow flashlight . the amount of spread is dependent on the wavelength . it would be very possible to create a cone of say x - ray radiation that would just bathe a single solar system . i have worked it out before - if you scaled up current x - ray laser technology and used the entire output of a modern nuclear power plant to power it , you would create a 300 mile wide beam at the distance of alpha centauri . use visible light instead of x - ray , and it ' s closer to solar system sized .	0

" i have not heard this elsewhere , but this is my take on it : when they pass through the threshold of the box ( from forward time to backward time or vise - versa ) there has got to be many moments where different parts of their bodies are operating in different directions in time . i imagine this might cause some processes that happen on a very small scale to screw up the same way bombarding a cell with radiation causes errors in its <allcaps> dna </allcaps> . for example , a protein might not fold correctly if half of it is folding " " forward " " in time while the other half is folding " " backward " " .

not to change the topic too much but stephen colbert would probably an amazing host . he ' s a musical theatre aficionado , he can sing and dance , he ' s charming as hell , he ' s very respectful , but as we saw in the correspondents dinner he can zing with the best of them . the main problem would be who he would host as . his public persona is essentially his late night character , who would not necessarily relish the ability to song and dance his way through a show although he would probably enjoy offending the nominees . whereas real world colbert would probably be a better theatre performer but not do such a good job as the harsh humour . perhaps he could just combine the two but i can not see them asking him or him agreeing to it for some reason .	0

i think the hiphop score should work really well , and is a smart choice . during the time of the novel , jazz music was seen as extravagant and a little scandalous and subversive . but nowadays jazz is seen as old - fashioned . now , rap and hiphop sort of serve the same purpose that jazz served in the 2 0 s . a fully period - appropriate , jazz heavy score would not have the same thematic weight as a score using modern music , in my opinion .	0

after stark ' s cameo in hulk , i expected them to go down the ultimates route . avengers assemble to take down the hulk in the 1 st act , loki turns up and they have to use hulk to beat the chitauri in act 3 , rolls credits . i imagine they are reluctant to use hulk as a villain though .	0

yeah that one flew under the radar but it ' s great . it ' s a 2009 movie though , and that year had loads of huge flicks like inglorious bastards , star trek , avatar , up , etc . which i think might have made getting noticed more difficult for smaller conceptual movie like this .	0

marvel recently got the rights to blade , daredevil , the punisher and i think ghost rider back . i would love to see those characters brought to the screen right ( blade was done pretty well the first two times ) . i would actually really like to see thomas jane back as the punisher . i did not like that movie very much , but i thought he played the part well . he also made a short film called dirty laundry that shows how committed to the part he is .	0
yet the second one continues from the canon laid out in the first .	0

usually it ' s payed through checks ( usually fake ) or with wire transfer ( usually real ) . the wire scam needs a 3 rd person . the scammer lists a more expensive item for a really low price . let us say he put up a 7 0 k dollar porsche for 4 0 k . puts up some story on how it ' s perfect running condition just needs to get rid of it because they are moving out of the country , buying a family car , it ' s just picking up dust in their garage . maybe it ' s not perfect but the damage is only a couple hundred or grand worth and they are cutting you a $ 3 0 k deal . point is they do not need it and they are willing to take a major loss on it to sell it fast since half the cash is better than a car they do not need . in coming sucker <hashtag> 2 </hashtag> . they see this awesome deal and look past the obviously low price because of the good story . the scammer gets them to send the money order to sucker <hashtag> 1 </hashtag> . now sucker <hashtag> 1 </hashtag> is happy they have almost twice the money and only needed to do a little leg work pushing the paperwork to ship it . sucker <hashtag> 2 </hashtag> gets a fake tracking number or some other fake paperwork . they wait for their car and when they eventually do not get it they file a police report . now police sometimes do not mess with money wiring since it ' s known to be used for scams and the money gram form specifically say that if you do not know the person it ' s probably a scam . if they do not investigate sucker <hashtag> 2 </hashtag> is out 4 0 k . if they do investigate guess who left a paper trail ? now they find you and you are out of 4 0 k ( or your car depending on how you look at it ) . you tell them about your car depending on how much they care they can just close the case at this point since they found the money . if they decide to follow it usually they will find that the truck was picked up by a person who does not exist , died , was payed a small amount to pick it up for someone else . you are truck is either in pieces being sold for parts or shipped out of the country to a county were paper work is not a huge deal . that ' s if you shipped it in the same state or country <allcaps> and </allcaps> you are lucky . if you ship it out of the country you will be lucky if they do not laugh in your face .	0

a movie being emotionally manipulative is not necessarily a bad thing , as long as it ' s done well . my problem with forrest gump is how bland the main character is . forrest is defined by the fact that he ' s mentally disabled , that ' s it . he has no other character traits as far as i can tell . he ' s so 2 dimensional and lifeless that it ' s hard to get invested in the sentimentality of the film .	0

as a fan of del toro ' s work , i respectfully disagree . he ' s a versatile director , and when the movie calls for cool factor over plausibility ( and i do believe that is a legitimate approach ) , he delivers . cronos and the hellboy movies also had lots of implausible stuff , but they were not necessarily worse for it .	0

oh shit i did not read that comment you posted earlier that listed those movies that were less than stellar . you are right fuck that affleck guy . <repeated>	1
well the authors point is that an actor can actually still do well when there is public outcry at his / her casting . yes sometimes the complaints come to fruition . but also there are times when everyone is excited and the actor blows . the only thing these scenarios all have in common is that the final opinions are made once the movie comes out . not 2 years prior . so people need to chill out	0
he ' s a far more believable bond than any of the others however . and he ' s able to pull off bond ' s quips which <allcaps> imo </allcaps> makes him the best . i too bashed him at the start , but he shut me down .	0
i think the article ' s point is more that you can make unpopular casting decisions and still makes tons of money . because a third of those films were poorly cast , another third are considered classic but kind of suck and are mostly nostalgic , and a couple of them are so old that i do not even understand the relevance .	0
pierce is the only bond that i will acknowledge .	0

honestly , off the top of my head , dogma is the only movie i can think of that has a ' significant ' ending at a church . not really about the other stuff you said , but since you said you caught the bare end and bits and pieces between black outs , its possible <emphasis> you constructed a story to fit the ending you saw . i do the same thing some times lol	0
i loved it , personally !	0

i think it ' s just that movies like this have a world wide appeal , and can make 300 million at the drop of a hat , and trying something new has a chance to flop . i guess you can not blame them for making money , i just wish there were better avenues for movies of the non world saving varieties .	0

that ' s true for anything . not everyone likes a movie no matter how good you think it is , just like i do not like the ending of the cabin in the woods like you do . yes i understand what the ending was supposed to do , i still do not like it , and it still ruined the rest of the movie for me .	0

they may very well be right , and they may very well be wrong . i hope to see the film to find out , however i am not really going to just assume that it is misogynistic , because people have conflated the character and the work before . maybe the work did it this time , but maybe not .	0

every plot hole can be explained if you depart logic and ignore blinding inconsistencies . which is far easier i suppose than to admit that the film suffered from lazy writing and poor directing . honestly , look at the numbers of people here and on the rest of the internet that all get together and discuss the holes in prometheus . do you honestly believe that just so happened to fully understand prometheus and the rest of us are just some sort of simpletons , banging rocks around complaining , because we are ignorant ? or are you just so desperate to make excuses for a bad movie that you will try to disparage it ' s detractors rather than come to terms with its imperfections ?	0

" i see what you mean . maybe what i said wasn ' t the best way to discredit the negative criticism . i do not know , i think as long as a movie gets something right it can not be " " worst movie " " material . take the fountain and cloud atlas , story aside they both had great visuals and great scores . even if you did not like the story at least it got those right , and you had some enjoyment . if something is a " " worst movie " " or flat out bad movie , i ' d except that more than just the story would have to be flawed . if that makes any sense haha . i am not a film critic or film major so my logic is probably still flawed "	0

the thing about it is , a lot of tarantino ' s films are not that violent . they are more dialogue heavy than anything . compare them with something like what john mctiernan puts out and you will see where i am coming from .	0
just playing devil ' s advocate here , but if the fact that it ' s going to degrade with time , get stolen , lost , etc . is your reasoning for avoiding an emotional attachment with an object , how is that any different than getting attached to a person ?	0

but most people do not have that recording device in a position with line of sight to the entire movie screen for the duration of the movie . if someone was holding their phone up for the entire movie 1 . they are a jerk and 2 . they are probably going to draw suspicion from theater employees	0

here ' s the thing : heath was cast by an excellent director . that rule does not work with movies with subpar people doing the casting .	0
a different actress played the part of samantha during the filming of the movie . johansson was hired afterward because he thought something was missing . i think he would have hired her right away if it was intentional . both writer / directors probably put a lot of their personal experiences into the work , but i do not think johansson has much to do with it . just has a sultry voice .	0

however , the laughs from 3 / 4 ' s of the film do kind of drown out the message until you really think about it . actually , i take that back . hitting his wife , calling her a viscous cunt , and nearly murdering his kid was really jarring . you ( should ) get it right away .	0

you are right that the music from frozen has a definite broadway influence . but broadway musicals have changed , drastically , over the last 10 to 20 years . go back and listen to phantom and compare that to something like wicked and you will notice a * huge <emphasis> * change in tonality . broadway itself has become more pop inspired and decreased in quality ( from what i gather ) of the major , popular titles .	0

he ' s great because he ' s jesus and jesus is great . they also usually show people just standing around loving the shit out of this guy and letting their kids sit in his lap like a mall santa and , when he gets around to it , he might heal a few crippled guys and then everyone is amazed . he ' s not even that great a teacher , sure he expounds on a few things that are more or less common sense but he never really did anything on a personal level for anyone . he ' s always shown walking around with a weird , spaced out expression like he ' s neither here nor there talking down to people but never actually being anyone ' s friend .	0

yeah , keep joking man . totally funny this guy died in front of his wife while trying to communicate with his daughter . so funny .	1
its also probably one of the most relevant movies about modern society and where its going . its similar on couple of thematic levels to wall - e , especially regarding our ever growing dependence on technology .	0
i remember 21 jump street being one of the very few movies where the trailer did not really make me want to go see it , since trailers can make just about any movie look good . i was pleasantly surprised at how funny it turned out to be , i loved the chase scene with the motorcycle gang .	0
the thing is i actually found myself agreeing with some things he said in that episode , to my surprise . most of what he said was ludicrous though like his opinion that a brit should not be making a movie about an american story . but all in all he seems like the very definition of a contrarian . just going against the grain for the sake of it	0
it ' s to downvote comments that add nothing to the discussion . that ' s the point of it .	0

such an emotional film . watched it recently as well and just sat there in silence when the credits started to roll .	0

my problem with <allcaps> hfr </allcaps> is that it ' s trying to look more realistic while filming fake things . it removes the soft filter that helps with immersion . all i see are poorly painted sets , bad makeup , and fake materials . i honestly thought i was watching a clever advertisement before gandalf showed up at the tavern . it constantly snapped me out of the fantasy .	0
viral marketing just gets crazier and crazier with every movie .	0

i love samurai jack , but modern scifi does not need more remakes and ' things turned into movies ' . there ' s not a lot of new ideas though , which is why we keep getting that kind of stuff . indie scifi has way more new ideas and new takes on old ideas because hollywood is afraid of anything new that does not have a top - selling book or show behind it .	0

yup . seems to be a mix of dreams , ran and kagemusha .	0
so this movie is basically the same as snakes on a plane . never mind being able to pull in fans from parks and rec , doctor who , vin diesel , zoe saldana , the <allcaps> mcu </allcaps> in general , and fans of summer blockbusters . i am not saying it ' s going to be the next star wars , but i hardly think snakes on a plane is a fair comparison .	0
i want to see cap pick up the hammer in the <allcaps> mcu </allcaps> . that would be totally badass .	0
all of the movies on the front of the magazine are retreads , it is pretty funny . godzilla , star wars 7 , avatar 2 , jurassic world , terminator 5 and then a muppets movie and two historical epics . at least hollywood is throwing some ingenuity and creativity behind their summer tentpoles .	1

8 1 / 2 is essentially about fellini making 8 1 / 2 . if you have not seen it already i would highly recommend watching it and then watching it with the tullio kezich ( who was a good friend of fellini ' s ) commentary that comes with the criterion version , its really fascinating if you are in to cinema .	0
so what about the people saying ' frozen was a great movie ' without any explanation ? are they just as guilty ?	0
disney used to give bonuses to their artists that worked on an incredibly profitable animated film , like little mermaid , beauty and lion king . with frozen being the third highest grossing animated movie of all - time , nearing $1b , surely they must have given out bonuses by now right ?	1

depends on the horror - if it ' s a really good film , perhaps alone , but if you are watching something for a laugh and a bit of fun , and the film probably is not that staggering ( like the paranormal activity movies ) , then it ' s infinitely better with people . half the enjoyment is laughing at your friends jumping at the scary bits .	0

sam raimi is not directing this . he is only producing . personally i do not think he should direct the last of us but would be willing to give him a shot only if he cooperates with the naughty dog team . i think neil druckmann would make an excellent director for the film adaptation but from what i learned watching the documentary of the making of the last of us is his ability to change the script while shooting the game would not go well with the hollywood suits who normally make the changes on scripts . so i do not think they would pick neil . i hope they find a good director who actually knows the content and can make a good video game adaptation .	0

we should petition the academy to revoke 12 year ' s award because it is clearly a fraudulent victory because of those two votes . there are better movies that deserve that award but did not get it because people just wrote down whatever big name movie there was with big name celebrity . movies with an actual story and purpose deserve these awards instead of the same old rehashed special effects and adaptations / reboots that come from big corporate studios .	1

this actually happened to me with tarantino ' s screenplay for natural born killers . i read it before seeing the film and did not know that it had been rewritten pretty extensively . i like the original screenplay so much better .	0
his girlfriend is olive oil .	0
at least you have the excuse that it ' s not on <allcaps> dvd </allcaps> yet . but once it is you should get on that .	0
no doubt the criticism of this movie will be objective and non - circlejerkish in this thread .	1
haha yeah that ' s one of my points about daltons films they are like craigs film but lots of people think dalton was a rubbish bond .	0
yea his character was pretty much the same as in step brothers and he nailed it again	0
over the top - sylvester stallone uses arm wrestling to win back his some who he abandoned at birth . classic	1
ok when does this come out ? it looks cool .	0
i did not really get the point they were trying to make there . i think this movie was too subtle .	1
i think a lot of action movies have this problem . they can have thrilling , gorgeous action scenes , but if there ' s nothing of substance between those shots it ' s not going to have broad appeal . for the people who do love it , no it should not matter , but i am glad reviewers and critics do take into account things like predictability . just going by sheer enjoyment would make the review more person specific , so it helps me better gauge the chances i will actually enjoy it .	0
" i thought it really fell apart in the third act . also , i just watched part 2 on netflix and it was basically " " jump scares : the movie . " " "	0
i think because it holds so many similarities to goodfellas , it often is not judged on its own . but it is a downright fantastic movie . i do not watch it nearly as much as i should , sadly ( as often when i have the desire for that type of movie , i reach for goodfellas ) . i really should buy the blu ray to try and change that .	0
definitely my favorite wes anderson movie . and that ' s saying a lot .	0
i actually thought he was going to make a flip towards being a hero near the end but they went the safe route and just made him a mustache twirler .	0
" no ! this perpetuates the growing refusal of people with lots of money to pay artists and writers for their work because " " it ' ll help them get ahead " " or " " they love to do it .

i do not know , man . i kinda had my heart set on brett ratner .	1
lawrence of arabia .	0
as i said , it ' s not a significant matter , so i will not go back and forth with you too much . if you think tom hanks , anthony hopkins etc do not prep incredibly hard for their roles , including simply being naturally talented and perfecting their craft over very long careers , among many other ways they prep that are just simply different than <allcaps> ddl </allcaps> then i am not sure you can form a proper opinion . if you also lack the understanding that an actor like <allcaps> ddl </allcaps> was required to pull off , not all , but a lot of the roles he chose that he did so well in , then you do not understand a lot about actors choosing roles and casting directors choosing certain actors . he may be only slightly better in those roles than hanks and hopkins . <repeated> but it takes that role and movie from good to a classic .	0
it ' s not graphic in a bloody sense , but i am surprised that they show it , and a pretty good shot of it as well . i just got back from it and the whole cinema gasped when it happened .	0
epik may may : ^ )	0

asghar farhadi made probably the two best movie endings of the 2010 ' s so far , with a separation and the past . so clever , so emotional , just all around amazing endings to already great films .	0
so . <repeated> did the movie itself get changed as well ? sex scenes removed , and some impalement added ?	0
i feel like i did most of the work in that battle .	0

no , i think you are right . everyone copes in different ways . i can see how this would help for some , and i am sure it helps him in many ways ( otherwise why would he do it ? ) it was just hard for me to merge laughter with tragedy . but , you are right - to each his own .	0
i think a lot of zeitgeisty movies are destined for this as the cultural touchstones they play on disappear over time . movies like wall street , scarface , etc . for example .	0

i thought the reason they had him kill zod was so he would make his core values of not to kill in later films . it was to set up that superman does not want to resort to what he had to do to zod to anyone else . that ' s the impression i got from it anyway .	0

alien 3 . the <allcaps> cgi </allcaps> is laughable at this point . it ' s sad when movies from 1979 and 1986 far outshine a 1992 movie in the special effects dept , and that ' s not even getting into how stupid and boring the story was .	0

well , fair enough . that was just my opinion of why i could see people not liking it . it is definitely a strange film , but i appreciate it ' s weirdness and for some reason i just found that i enjoyed it . do not really have one part that i identify as what made me like it though	0
well killing zoe was written by roger avary , who wrote pulp fiction with tarantino , so that really can not be a huge surprise . things to do in denver when you are dead does not feel like a tarantino to me at all .	0

i do not think theres anything super analyzing about it . just like <allcaps> tmnt </allcaps> 3 , batman forever and batman & robin were money makers for the producers because they saw the potential of how children were drawn to it . make the movie likable to children plus add an arsenal of toys to go with it . boom you got success . at the end of the day , it was all about the kids .	0

the amount of enemy combatants was probably exaggerated , but they were all shot and hit by shrapnel multiple times . there are countless examples through modern military history of soldiers taking multiple grievous injuries yet still continuing to fight . it may seem like an action or war movie cliche , but it is very much a real thing that happens .	0

a good article , but , like i said in my comment , i do not think that was too far fetched at all . in fact , i ' d say it ' s rather spoon fed to the audience . i liked the film a whole lot , but it felt too contrived to scratch that itch , you know ? i will pm you the review when i am on my pc , on my phone at the moment . in simple words , enemy could ' ve harboured subtlety and tact instead of waving its flag where everyone can see it . villeneuve ' s a good director , incendies is great and prisoners was good . enemy was good , but he suffers from the same problem as many : exposition .	0

the cartoon is only part of the canon . most of it was fleshed out in the comics . but yes , i wish that the movies were about the evil deceptions attempting to subjugate humanity for the purpose of exploiting their labour and harvesting a nonrenewable energy source . escalation of technology with drones , combiners , and pretenders could have all been critical developments in the war between the factions but instead they are casually included as pitiful homages . transformers are spiritual beings but that ' s completely discarded . so much material for truly rich and interesting plots has been misused and bastardised to the point that the current movie series is totally unsalvageable for the purpose of meaningful storytelling . i mean , the autobots could at least give humans shit for not granting freedom to all sentient beings .	0

the vampire one you are referring to is from dusk ' til dawn , and it was directed by robert rodriguez ( quentin tarantino only starred in it ) . also , try out true romance . tarantino wrote it , but did not direct . christian slater as the lead is a little awkward , but gary oldman , james gandolfini , christopher walken , and brad pitt make up for it .	0
god no . the whole movie would turn into a depp vehicle where he wears a stupid hat and talks like a drunken irishman .	0

there ' s nothing wrong with thinking it , of course , but why mention it at all in a thread supposedly about best actresses ? how they look should not matter - it ' s about their acting talent , and bundling her looks with her worth as an actress is sends a message to those that read it that while good male actors are only good because they are good actors , good actresses are good partly because of their skill at acting and partly because of their looks .	0
you know i am the first to decry hollywood excess but i have a special place in my heart for the fast movies and the familia ethos . maybe its because i saw the films with the right group of friends or something but i basically think i would continue to watch it as long as they make them . even cody being introduced as a new member of the crew if his acting okay i am happy to have him there just as a reminder of paul really . maybe he hits a home run with it all too i hope	0

maybe there ' s a certain concentration needed .	0
to be fair i do not think he had final word on every shitty decision made on the series . the place was crawling with idiots and hacks . most had just written some crappy episode in felicity . some went on to write masterpieces like once upon a time or prometheus .	1

it was a crude caricature of southern accents , the type of southern accent people who never spent time in south assume we talk like . it was like listening to do an imitation of some some elses impression of a southern accent . it ' s not like i am blaming an actor in downton abbey for not talking like a modern brit . there are million better depictions across theater and film of antebellum era accents . leo is in theory a high profile enough actor that a decent voice coach could have fixed the issue .	0

it was intended as a trilogy , so that ' s why it did not happen . it almost looks like they changed direction sometime while making the movie . i think it was great until the last 30 minutes or so , where they start to do nonsencical shit for stupid reasons . but they are still breaking into a major facility . <repeated> almost as if they kept the setting and came up with some new ending for the now first movie of the trilogy .	0

oh , i dunno . he could be being ironic since the movie he ' s reviewing has like a 94% on rotten tomatoes and an average rating of 8.4 . he could be saying something about people who have sweeping generalizations of sequels and prequels or think that old ideas can not be relevant in a modern setting .	0

what about a system where each category ( blood , substance abuse , sex , violence , etc ) earns a certain number of points , and the higher the number , the more restricted the game is ? certain categories would automatically earn a set level ( like nudity ) , and a certain level if points would be restricted to those 17 and over ?	0
on that note i have always despised the fact that the breakfast club was rated r . seriously , it ' s a film that defines high school life and is the perfect film for people in that age group ( and beyond , i might add ) , yet many can not ( or at least could not ) simply because it was r for language and the fact that they smoke some weed . <repeated> rather typical for a bunch of high schoolers .	0

that ' s a fair counterpoint . i was initially fine with it when i heard he wanted to ' extend ' the movie . there ' s a lot of content that is only briefly hinted at in the book ( largely the necromancer at dol guldur subplot ) as well as some stuff in the appendices that would fit in well . plus , i think it really is a labor of love for peter jackson . just look at the physical transformation he goes through making these , he ' s certainly giving it his all . and this is the last tolkien movie he ' s allowed to make , so he wants to try and prolong the time he has left . fair enough . but yeah , when i saw what he actually did with the extended time . <repeated> i was a bit disappointing .	0

i didnt like the nano swarm either , and we saw very little transformations , i mean , the few transformations we saw were good ones , optimus in particular , but the nano swarm was a cheap plot device , also it wasnt clear as to what was able to definitely kill them , after all , if they are made of reconstructive particles , wouldnt they be able to just reconstruct themselves after getting destroyed ? i mean , is not like they have a weakspot like the transformers have their spark on their chest , these ones were shown to not have a spark , so for me , i dont see how they could die .	0

i can not watch casino royale . i know there ' s a good movie in there ( likely the parts paul haggis did not write ) , but the poker is so badly represented , as a poker player it ' s painful to watch . it ' s absurd , illogical , cliched and just plain idiotic . it flat out ruined the film for me .	0
godzilla portrays the monsters from a human perspective . we are always looking up at the monsters as we watched them rumble through recognizable landmarks . you always felt small because from the cameras perspective you are small , that in turn makes them feel huge . in pacific rim , the fights are largely shown from the jaeger ' s perspective . all of the monsters seem relatively eye level and that looses a bunch of the size and scale . the viewer feels as big as the monsters on screen . you never really feel small like you do in godzilla .	0

yes . the original outline story was written by kip thorne , a physicist whose most famous works involve the dynamics of wormholes .	0
agreed . if you want to have your hero fight a monster that cannot be practically created , there is no alternative . you can not have perseus fight medusa , or iron man flying around a city street , without mixing the media . to have done what was done in the past any other way would have been even more jarring , and the sheer brilliance of the conception ultimately trumps the lack of reality .	0

yeah because a story about a man in an iron suit , a norse god , a giant radioactive stack of green muscle , a modern day archer , a 1 9 4 0 s bioengineered superhuman , and sexy spy fighting in skin tights and heels coming to save the world from an intergalactic being makes so much more sense .	1

i remember it well . never watched it .	0
no , but the entire point here is that while it would be worth it for you to piss on your boss for 7 million , making this movie was not worth it for whoopi goldberg . this is something that she , without doubt , was worse off in the long run for doing . and she knew it at the time , which is why she wanted to get out of doing the movie . how much it would be worth it for you to piss on your boss for 7 million does not change that , and entirely ignores what is logically relevant to the discussion .	0

this is the kind of music that i discovered in middle school and fell in love with . what makes me happiest about this soundtrack is it ' s introducing a lot of great old hits to a younger crowd . there were a lot of little kids in the theater that i went to and i am glad that at least one of them would have gone home and looked up some of the songs . a lot of these tracks do not deserve to be forgotten .	0

do they refer to it in that name in the comics ? i heard them calling it an orb in the movie , but that seemed generic , unlike the aether or tesseract . that is a cool name though .	0
now we are just getting recursive .	0
no , but you hear people talking quietly about a movie they look forward to seeing , or groans if a trailer looks terrible . also , i find if you go to early screens of movies , particularly action / comic / boom movies you tend to get a more vocal theatre that will be respectful enough not to ruin the experience , but will be vocal about what is going on . cheers , laughter , applause , groans , etc .	0
it ' s almost as if all opinions are subjective . <repeated> who would have thought ? it is however a shared opinion among many that hayao miyazaki is a great director considering the volume of accolades his films have received , including * the wind rises * .	0
it was still a great movie , though .	0
i do not think it ' ll happen . the academy is not exactly made of forward - thinking people . they are very traditional and conservative when it comes to how movies are made . that ' s why you may not see voice acting as a category anytime soon ( because it ' s not a traditional form of acting ) . that ' s also why you will never see films like the avengers , scott pilgrim , etc . winning any awards , even though these are way more fun to watch than the average oscar winner and the critics like them just as much .	0
if after hours , it was a secure screening .	0

it was alright to me , as a big transformers fan . i liked the designs and the villains , galvatron was well done . they could ' ve given the characters some backstory . drift seemed really racist ? action was good . humans were not terrible . i ' d rate it 3 rd best tf movie , not counting the original animated one .	0
that would be about $75 in australia i reckon .	0
that ' s the entire premise of the film , though . that is not shoe - horning an element completely outside the genre into a film , that ' s just what the film is supposed to be .	0

yeah , that worked so well with green lantern .	1
other than they can do that in an r rated film as well , pg - 13 can , best case scenario , be almost as good as the r rated one . i think cartoony gore is a big part of deadpool that i would be sad to see go .	0
they need to make it like this holy shit that ' s so good .	0
i will admit , he could look better . but there ' s no reason they can not change it up a bit for avengers 3 .	0
yes , we are men . men is what we are .	0
yeah . it ' s even set in 2014 .	0
guardians of the galaxy can fit into their current movie franchise perfectly , though . deadpool , on the other hand , can not . not without either keeping him completely separate from the rest of the marvel universe , or dumbing him down to a pg - 13 rating .	0

peter jackson ' s chief mistake is trying to make the hobbit a prequel to lord of the rings rather than a stand alone story . the two stories are different in style and tone , intended for different audiences . jackson has made quite the mess of the story by not only changing the style and tone , but adding elements not originally present . and then there is the bad <allcaps> cgi </allcaps> .	0

sorry i guess i had tarantino in my mind	0
that ' s if the studios do not get involved and royally screw with the tone because they think they need some kind of slapstick that sticks out because the audience just will not get it . ezio and edward were the funniest of the two assassins , but their humor was interwoven with their character and the story in many ways , sort of like how edward was just a brash asshole who eventually turned his life around .	0
<allcaps> itt </allcaps> : but hurt people from ohio .	0
oh yea totally . it completely sucked how they had 1 voice actor for singing and talking , instead of having two mismatched voices in the sub . terrible . terrible dub .	1

i am saying this as a comic fan so maybe i am biased . i at least entertain the possibility . i just think the films are not forgettable on a single basis . there have been some relative misses like iron man 2 but even that is more enjoyable to me than most action flicks these days . <allcaps> tws </allcaps> is legitimately the best blockbuster action movie i have seen in years . it was a complete package . <allcaps> gotg </allcaps> also recently hit some brilliant marks . when is the last time we got a good space movie ? comics are serial in nature and the <allcaps> mcu </allcaps> rocks <allcaps> because </allcaps> it adheres to that but the solo flicks are still good or for the sake of our actual argument far more entertaining then non nolan dc movies imo . dc very clearly is nowhere near as cohesive as marvel what with the shows being separate ( but better so far ) and now there are rumors shazam is not even a part of their universe what with a different studio working on it . until they make a movie that is half as true to the comics or have as interesting i would say marvel is easily the king . it ' s also worth noting that the ones considered the best ( bar im 1 ) are consecutive and the newest releases . they have not had a hint of decline yet so <allcaps> aou </allcaps> may just blow out the fanbase as well as avengers . avengers is the most true movie to a real comic storyline as we have ever gotten imo . that should be what the comic genre is all about . does not have to be in tone but in attitude .	0

except those are all really well known movies . the problem with this list is not the list itself , it ' s the title . it ' s supposed to be lesser known movies that a lot of people have not heard of .	0
disney ' s frozen . took 3 viewings in theatres for me to fall in love with it .	0
he was supposed to be the new chewbacca hahaha what a joke .	0
" lord of the rings is only " " bad " " because we know what it should have been . if you can separate yourself from that expectation then it ' s really and awesome animated movie . at least i loved it . "	0
there ' s still something to be said about being a notch before <emphasis> the rest , though , right ?	0
how in the hell is chomet so far down this list ?	0
bartok the magnificent is the superior spin - off .	0
yeah , i considered that too . maybe it ' s so bad / weird that they feel like releasing it would be an insult to him . but critic reviews were positive so i do not think this is the case .	0
x - men ?	0
blade 2 is my go - to example for an ideal pure action movie . the plot moves super fast and does not get in the way , the characters are developed quickly and almost entirely through one - liners , and the action is intense , full , and exciting . pure action generally does not do well with critics , and 67% is pretty damn good .	0
god damn this will be difficult to pull off .	0
that ' s the thing about the prequels , though . you are right , the original trilogy <allcaps> was </allcaps> all kid ' s movies , but the darker sort of kid ' s movie . i think lucas tried to make the prequels more of a movie <allcaps> for </allcaps> the people who grew up on the original movies . but i think somewhere along the line , he figured that those people grew up boring . look at the main reasons for conflict in the two trilogies : in the ot , the empire is destroying planets and ruling through fear . in the prequels , the trade federation is sort of rebelling , and the reason involves trade routes . we know that palpatine is manipulating them , but they themselves do not appear to have any real goals .	0
certainly better than moonrise or darjeeling .	0

no , we hate him for those reasons , plus also that he is clearly a <allcaps> cgi </allcaps> character .	0

i do not . i loved the movie and went to see what other people thought . <repeated> it just made me lose faith in movie goers .	0

cold in july was pretty good , not you stereotypical ending which is a good thing i think , i sort of wish it went on longer , but that forces my mind to imagine what the lead role was going to do after the fact . it is worth mentioning that the sound track for this movie was amazing ! <repeated> if you played the 8 0 s <allcaps> dlc </allcaps> for farcry 3 the music is nearly identical , freakin ' badass .	0

just keep in mind with the subsonic ammo he ' s using , those rounds have less velocity than my pellet gun . that ' s for very close range combat only . if you were standing and fired straight ahead parallel to the ground , the bullet is in the grass less than 150 feet away .	0
it ' s a great caliber . it runs smoothly and hurls 8 5 g barnes <allcaps> tsx </allcaps> bullets at 3000 fps . it ' s probably better than a . 3 0 0 blk past 150 , but the 6.8 cartridge limits the size of projectile you can use in an ar15 configuration . when you are trying to maximize force and your limiting factor is ~ 1000 fps , the heavier projectile is better . therefore the . 300 is better for suppressed applications . i have never run a 6.8 in an <allcaps> sbr </allcaps> , but everything i have read indicates it does well . it does not seem to lose much velocity as the barrel shrinks .	0

oh <elongated> ok . so it is not just one suit then ? that makes me relieved . tony ' s suits in iron man 3 came across as pretty destructible . i was unsure how this was going to work as the main villain . which also explains seeing the hulkbuster fighting hulk , it ' s probably not stark controlling it .	0
i think i would say wait of you are afraid of spoilahs .	0
i think this will be a great continuation with the state of the world after the events of cap 2 . a darker marvel film that still has the usual charm and banter is my dream , and it totally looks like avenger 2 will hold up .	0

nah , he ' s under contract for captain america 3 . plus that civil war storyline would be pretty lame if bucky , aka guy who ' s never interacted with stark before this film , were to be the head of the anti - registration side of things .	0
anyone else think of this guy as erasmus from dune ?	0
i think they are going to show multiple forms of ultron in this movie . i am sure at least one of them will look like the classic comic book version . his cyber - goons look sorta like he does in the comics .	0

honestly a lot of the phase one movies were not very good . captain america , iron man 2 , and thor were fairly mediocre . it was simply people being excited about a shared universe that helped the series progress . phase 2 has been much better as gotg and captain 2 were much better films than i expected .	0

i use that terrible line from * mortal kombat : annihilation * as an example of why , in a hypothetical * mass effect * film , the whole benezia story should be seriously tweaked . it would be the nail in the coffin for the possibility of good video game movies if it played out as it did in the games , because it was just so fucking badly written and acted . it still needs to be there to develop liara as a character , so it ' s a conflicting situation .	0

exactly . and ( especially in recent bond films ) the bond movies do not always portray women as devious femme fatales or weak damsels in distress , with nothing in between . even in the connery films , female characters like tatiana romanova and domino derval did not fit into any one of those extreme stereotypes .	0

i do not think the logic checks out here . just because an event was terrible is not a reason to make a film about it . if the filmmakers have something interesting to say about the event , then go for it . it could turn out to be a great film . it could also be awful , but hey , that does not really have anything to do with the event they are making the film about , and more to do with the skill of the filmmakers .	0

bit late to the discussion , but i just thought of something . how did rita know that receiving a blood transplant nixed her ability to repeat ? is not that the sort of thing that only her ( permanent ) death would reveal ?	0
for a long time i would have thought a comment like yours was just grumbling . but these last few years in hollywood cinema ( also starting to learn a little more about the industry ) has really shown otherwise . there is a pervasive paranoid fear of the original out there . the only examples of people dodging it are those who put in their time on reboots to develop a good relationship with studios . eg , chris nolan doing batman with wb then inception after that series is successful .	0
i wasn ' t a big fan of the original , but i loved <elongated> the remake .	0
he was also one of the least prominent cast members of <allcaps> snl </allcaps> . he was barely in any skits , and was only memorable for his inability to remain in character for more than 4 seconds .	0
yeah , i watched the raid with dub once with my brother because he does not like subtitles , and it really confirmed by belief that the actor ' s voice is always a better choice , at least for live action . in particular , the boss talking over the intercom is so much more menacing in indonesian , just because of tone , inflection , etc .	0
do you want to wait a decade for reboots to come out ? i for one am hoping that they start streamlining the process a little more . maybe every five years at first , then three . <repeated> and finally arriving at the point where i can visit a ten theater building and hop from theater to theater watching remakes of the movies i just finished watching . how about it hollywood ?	1
i will save you the trouble , they really are watching him , his paranoia turns out to be justified .	0
do not question it man he was being brave and sacrificing himself	1

i thought that it was max von sydow	0
oh , you mean like how when quigon ( i am so sorry for the spelling ) rams his saber into the shield doors at the beginning of episode 1 and it does not just instantly go through ? the lightsaber appears to project out from the hilt and if it meets interference , the length of the blade is reduced to the contact point or as deep as it can destroy the interference material , which increases over time . this would suggest that the dimensions of the lightsaber are not fixed , but determined by the position of the hilt and projected outward . however , lightsabers also interact with each other horizontally , as if the light blade were a rigid object along its length and incapable of deflection . so , lightsabers make no god damn sense at all . conclusion : it ' s a movie .	0
that ' s true of all lightsabers . the blades are weightless and there ' s said to be an awkward gyroscopic effect . it ' s been stated to be all but impossible for normal folk to wield them without losing chunks of flesh in the process .	0

personally i did not care that much . i do not care if they change the ethnicity of a character . people are too hyper sensitive about race .	0
that book was my shit when i found it on the shelf in grade 5 .	0
that was all very interesting , but i think i ' d also add that in the original they used a decent amount of puppets or animatronics , which worked well for dinosaurs as well . i think nowadays productions rely more heavily on cg , and less directing and whatnot is influenced by what is or is not possible . basically anything is possible now .	0

the annie remake has black people , how dare you not support it by default regardless of its merits as a film , you filthy racist !	1

i heart huckabees .	1
you clearly were not using a high enough percentage of your brain power if you thought it was bad .	1
olay , i guess that ' s it . we never should have cared in the first place . someone personally did not care for the movie . it ' s over .	1
he ' s gonna play keaton , playing beetlejuice . it ' ll be like ed wood .	1
yeah , because those prequels rocked !	1
all white everything . what ' s so wrong with that ?	1
lol so funny	1
well , at least we are getting an americanized version of attack on titan !	1
damn right we are !	1
is he racist ? not wanting white people ?	1
because we can totally trust the north koreans not to lie .	1
i am sure kim would walk toward his own death over a comedy .	1

yeah , american corporations are all about capitulation	1
thanks obama ! <repeated> the president is supposed to stand strong against north korea . your liberal spine can not stand up to north korea ' s threats .	1
so , can people do this to voting booths until we get actual candidates that represent the people ?	1
it is appeasement , and that works well with thugs and bullies .	1
maybe they are behind the hacker threats so that they will get publicity for canceling the movie at first then bringing it back so more people will want to see it .	1
i want to know how seth managed to get north korea to do the marketing for his new movie .	1
" this honestly sounds like the plot from the producers . " " good thing we ( sony ) took out that huge insurance policy now that we can not actually show the movie in theaters . <repeated> darn " " "	1

ghost in the shell , spirited away , death note and other masterpieces of film making .	1
surely he cut his own wage and his execs ' wages to help .	1
all you need is kill ?	1
any criticism or questioning of anything is a circlejerk dumbass	1
because the academy is so well - known for its artistic integrity , right ?	1
aye they are yank - washing this movie are not they ?	1
6 years is plenty of time to think of creative and original content . surely .	1
this made me laugh . that ' s hilarious . you will just have to go find some terrible <allcaps> lotr </allcaps> fan fiction to read now !	1
ah , come on . a teddy bear shit on the floor . and they made a bunch of references about movies in the 8 0 s . how is that not funny ?	1
i absolutely <emphasis> do . god , emilia clarke with fucked up teeth gives me a realism - in - movies hard - on .	1
but that ' s <allcaps> shoehorning in female characters </allcaps>	1
it did ! it ' s about overthrowing the patriarchy and government ! do not you know that making a movie about doing that is all you need to start a revolution now ?	1
it ' s a false flag to muddy the waters and give the conspiracy theorists that are actually onto something a bad name	1
<allcaps> sexist pig </allcaps> , <allcaps> how dare you </allcaps>	1

it really should just go to jaden . he ' s the logical choice here .	1
just what i have always wanted ; a movie full of misandry and husband jokes .	1
because bi - racial families do not exist and it is impossible for adopted siblings to have a strong family bond with eachother	1
aw man . you totally missed the part where he jacks off the elephant onto his dad . how could you miss a piece of cinema history like that ?	1
dont worry didnt you hear the next shaft movie is going to be an asian .	1

everyone knows that making films is easy , cheap , and not time - consuming at all .	1

it ' s clearly a jew propaganda film to make the world hate on the poor muzzies	1
i watch <allcaps> msnbc </allcaps> because i am smart	1
spoilers , man ! <repeated>	1
how dare they still publish shakespeare ? how dare they hang the mona lisa in the louvre ? how dare they play mozart ? how dare people enjoy older films ?	1
yeah , that ' s why <allcaps> no one </allcaps> has seen oldboy , right ?	1
wait , i thought we we were suppose to hate episode one in its entirety ?	1
yes because batman begins did not develop its characters at all .	1
hmm , maybe it ' s about time for a reboot .	1
yes ! another <emphasis> sequel ! finally ! i was really worried that there might be movies this year besides sequels and remakes , but it looks like my concerns were baseless . thank god .	1
oh okay , i did not realize jokes in movies could only be interpreted in one way , thanks for opening my mind !	1
yeah but marvel are artists and dc are rubbish and have no clue	1
yeah , they are always fun to think about anyway . clearly this is the next <allcaps> big </allcaps> subversive break through .	1
boss baby sounds like a winner .	1
psh <elongated> that movie is not even worth an academy award nomination .	1
yeah , would have been great to see bs that had nothing to do with the plot . the movies felt too short and some inane filler would have been fantastic .	1
what a triggering cis - gendered fuck .	1
yeah , fucking dolt 10 year olds .	1
i fail to see how showing a young kid the machete movies could go wrong at all .	1
yeah , forget about the atrocities that were a nightmare on elm street , what ' s eating gilbert grape , edward scissorhands , donnie brasco , blow , fear and loathing , ed wood , etc . they are terrible compared to the likes of dead man ' s chest and at world ' s end .	1
no . only sandler puts attractive women in movies .	1
the number 23	1
he can either have his powers or his legs . <allcaps> get with it </allcaps> !	1
did u know he was a pathological liar and homocidal maniac	1
looks like not only did they <allcaps> cgi </allcaps> his nose off , but they also <allcaps> cgi </allcaps> ' d his mouth to be more closed .	1
but it was original because they are blue and have floating islands	1
totally , the film does not actually have many problems at all .	1
ya because we all know that people honk their horn 5 or so seconds before they think an accident or emergency might occur to give others an opportunity to look around and make a decision right ?	1
well which cinema is it gonna take the place of ? the one with madagascar seats ? <repeated>	1
they are called vines , grandpa .	1
boy , i am glad they got someone who does not suck !	1
clint eastwood knows how to act with props . if he can do it on a national stage pretending obama is a chair , then surely bradley cooper can act with a fake baby	1
i was 15 when episode 1 came out and i loved the trade negotiations .	1
very valid criticisms	1
amazing ! they never film anything in vancouver	1
you are not a real american . go to sweden you terrorist loving commie .	1
it makes it more cinematic , duh	1
yeah because this guy was worse than hitler .	1
did you guys bring electricity and internet with you so that you can use that kind of stuff ? guess they do not have that in the desert yet .	1
no because jews are white !	1
yes . they totally should start hiring people based on their skin color rather than on their merits .	1
yeah i am totally going out and shooting people and i really am so hot , too - also i get tons of super hot women as well .	1
johnny tsunami begs to differ	1
oh , good ! a jury actually thought about the children !	1
" maybe he would be happier if they included a " " best negro " " category "	1
ya because oscar winner means everything .	1
sh <elongated> you are ruining my hipster cred	1
how you gonna nom something with no cuts for editing ?	1
wha <elongated> ? the imitation game and the theory of everything are totally not oscar bait .	1
yeah , because i felt soo good when leaving the imitation game .	1
sure , but we can not overdo it . what ' s next ? another black president right after obama .	1
yeah that ' s why gravity got all those crazy snubs !	1
he shit himself ! what more do you want ? ! <repeated>	1
she sounded drunk , which would explain a lot of the nominations	1
pretty much the same time .	1
so true . i mean , if you can not afford to pay for something it ' s your right to take that product .	1
but what about all the witty humor every 30 seconds ?	1
cuz kurt russell ' s never been in a shitty movie !	1
women . amirite guys ?	1
no worries , i intend to hit it big soon	1
yeah that needs to happen	1
yeah , they should not explain how the galactic empire came to be . we should just take their word for it .	1
women rate these films higher yes , but do they pass the bechdel test ?	1
first rule of art is it should require no work or thought from the viewer .	1
how can one become interesting like you ?	1
yeah , because his movies are not formulaic at all !	1
" he ' s too busy getting yelled at by the " " liberal media " " to hear you . "	1
dodgeball	1
no . he is a meticulous genius .	1
nope . nobody else is excited to see actors from a very popular ( at least on this sub ) series in one of the most anticipated movies of all time . you are the only one .	1
that and schindler ' s list .	1
you know , your right . actually i said hi to him and he powerbombed me through a luggage trailer .	1
why does a wrestler need acting lessons ?	1
it ' s a good thing whedon stuck to source material and added scarlett witch and quicksilver to the avengers before adding ant man and black panther .	1
yeah man you are so much better than all of those stupid people who can not enjoy great cinema because they use rotten tomatoes	1
yay ! homophobia !	1
dude this and hitman just focus on killing , it ' s so stupid and repetative .	1
directed by uwe boll . <repeated>	1
maybe they will release an alpha version .	1
while you watch the movie ? good strategy .	1
can not wait to see how they get a pepsi ad in there .	1
but but . <repeated> it ' s all <allcaps> cgi </allcaps> ! peter hackson does not use real sets !	1
and it will be a clear indicator that american audiences just do not care about anime adaptations !	1
oh man , you really got him good on that one .	1
oh look a neat fun fact ! let us all belittle the hobbit movies !	1
i have not seen anybody say it yet , so . <repeated> interstellar .	1
worked for smeagol .	1
amazing spiderman 2 trailers did a splendid job at this	1
see , one must pirate thousands of movies so they do not have to buy overpriced popcorn . it ' s fairness .	1
not yet , but seeing hoe the studios are getting paranoid i would not doubt this might be coming .	1
you mean obama did not deserve it ?	1
there are no movies made for kids . all movies are made for adults . even kid ' s movies .	1
nah man . see those hobbit movies ? now i can not even watch <allcaps> lotr </allcaps> .	1
okay guys . he promised . thats good enough for me . take my money !	1
platoon ?	1

how did black annie not make the list ?	1
yeah , everyone who likes things i do not like is an unsophisticated nerd !	1
what a nuanced view of <allcaps> cgi </allcaps> ' s place in cinema !	1
yes god forbid .	1
<allcaps> til </allcaps> leonardo dicaprio has never won an oscar .	1
surprised nic cage did not get the role .	1
i hope he dies and his entire family gets cancer since he did something bad to earn internet points ! <repeated>	1
but he ' s the only deserving actor to win !	1
from the hot mom in modern family to selma hayek , twice ? yeah , i feel bad for him .	1
bruh , he obviously just uses a photoshop filter	1
because the last movie was so <elongated> good	1

that ' s ollivander you filthy casual	1
boy , and i usually respect kevin sorbo ' s opinions on politics and acting so <emphasis> much .	1

because cinema snobs are literally cancer	1
not michael bay enough for op	1
all that white guilt gets to a man sometimes .	1
. <repeated> would it be a civil war involving a man of iron ?	1
can not wait for the reasonable discussion on here about how much boyhood sucks and how it not winning this award makes their opinions correct .	1
yeah man , i hate birdman because i do not watch superhero movies .	1
do they look alike or something ?	1
because male is the default / normal .	1
might as well call him atlantis jones then !	1
yes , because the whole film totally wasn ' t full of crass and over the top humor .	1
yea you are right . portraying someone afflicted with <allcaps> als </allcaps> is definitely easier .	1
thank you for your contribution to the conversation .	1
but it ' s so important to their character arcs that they enter three - story abandoned buildings alone carrying a gun with two bullets and three walkers attack so they learn how to think quickly .	1
why would you love that ?	1
but they <allcaps> didn </allcaps> ' t , did they ? ! <repeated> that ' s the true meaning of this piece . these kids will not drop their vidya games to go do some street art . what is this world coming to ? ! <repeated>	1
but my ignorant opinion of americans is based on a stereotype of people from only one part of the country . then i saw this movie about a guy from that part of the country . he was just like the stereotype . all of the people in america must be like that . also , why would not a movie about one man ' s experiences have a deep nuanced message about the geopolitics behind the war ?	1
but technically ?	1
i have always said we need a dark , gritty aquaman !	1
<allcaps> i couldnt </allcaps> . <allcaps> hear </allcaps> . <allcaps> anything </allcaps> ! luckily the exposition the crap out of his true intentions for the next 45 minutes so it ' s fine	1
no he ' s just a racist fatty hater	1
<allcaps> dae keanu reeves is god <laugh> </allcaps>	1
i am not one for hyperbole , but christopher nolan is the greatest cinematic genius that has ever walked the earth and if you disagree with me you are objectively wrong .	1
the geniuses who run the movie studios make the world safe again !	1
exciting car chase ? spoiler tags jeez .	1
too hollywood , you are right .	1
they should introduce , robot sharks and robot octopuses and release it direct to syfy ( unless it has been done ) .	1
what are you talking about ? there ' s plenty of white people in there , and one white person represents <allcaps> all </allcaps> white people .	1
but bro they are so over the top that they are awesome !	1
but . <repeated> but . <repeated> what ' s the point of getting stuff everybody else has ?	1
of course , that excuses the other things , how silly of me	1
i guess you do not understand the way the government treated the people during the 9 0 s . it ' s just a metaphor and that is not just the directors excuse to make a skull fucking baby fucking child fucking throat fucking fuckfest .	1
so lets get the director of godzilla to do it since he does not focus on the monsters !	1
they all look alike .	1
yeah , because yoda the puppet holds up so well after all these years .	1
yes because it was dubbed	1
a horror movie trailer without a jump - scare ? what kind of bullshit is that ?	1
" you feel sorry for an egotistical disingenuous spoiled little hollywood brat who looks like a moron because he has not had any life experiences because he is always completely insulated by money and fame ? yeah , me too . <repeated> poor little dude with no rules or boundaries . able to do whatever he desires . squandering it making " " rap " " videos with his " " people " " . poor little guy probably just needs a hug . "	1
<allcaps> dae </allcaps> think skyfall was a shitty home alone remake .	1

man , i did not know it snowed that much there ! throw another shrimp on the barbie , amiright ?	1
kids can not handle those situations . it ' s scarring . they have to go back and play <allcaps> gta </allcaps> .	1
does anybody knows if audi sponsor this movie ?	1

who can argue that top gun was better i mean there ' s been like 4 iron eagle movies and only one top gun .	1
" sure , and " " the whole bloody affair " " cut of kill bill is coming out any day now . "	1
nah man i want another reboot	1
that explains fucking <allcaps> speed racer </allcaps> .	1

who ?	1
" have you had " " the talk " " yet ? "	1
you are talking about dicks penetrating a mouth , that ' s triggering . please give a warning next time .	1
he ' s not christopher nolan	1
<allcaps> lol </allcaps> yeah , because matrix revolutions was such a great film , we need more of that .	1
* but . <repeated> but private prisons will save us money ! <repeated> *	1
are you kidding me ? ! <repeated> the powerpoint presentation in the remake was a great way of retelling it !	1
if you have not noticed already the world as we see it here in america revolves around us . i mean we <emphasis> invented freedom and the car .	1
the poc show up in ships to loot n pillage , its like you did not even watch the movies	1
fuck that ! a bet ' s a bet !	1
nah man , it ' s actually a deliberate orchestrated effort specifically to keep women oppressed and in their proper place . you are just being crazy .	1
what ' s <allcaps> vhs </allcaps> ?	1
boo <elongated> ! boo <elongated> jack black ! he totally ruined king kong !	1
yes , because cg effects are <hashtag> 1 </hashtag> priority in modern day films .	1
you have blown my mind man , i never thought of such a thing	1
reddit hated it until they realized everyone else also hated so instead they started praising it .	1
it ' s going to be so awesome ! i hope it ' s pg - 13 so everyone can go and see it !	1
they will need to remaster and rerelease all star wars movies to get a new generation interested	1
wow look at all those ethnic people	1
" no . <repeated> is it another " " fuck you " " movie like donnie darko ? "	1
10 / 10 will be the best movie ever	1
<allcaps> misogyny </allcaps> ! <repeated>	1
oh yeah , that totally happened .	1
oh yeah it will fail just like guardians of the galaxy did	1
man of steel , no doubt .	1
yeah screw you with your opinion	1
who cares ? this is america where ideas are stolen and sold for profits , you can not do shit about it	1
i am afraid these are hard times in the movie making business . do not you feel sorry for poor hollywood ?	1
karma ?	1
if that ' s the case , then go wb ! no more mortgage , no more student loans !	1
well they needed a <allcaps> gpu </allcaps> , where else would you find one ? ! <repeated>	1
2012 is the way to go	1
yeah , i forgot how bad those bombed at the box office . and they only <emphasis> have above an 8 on imdb !	1
b - but avengers is so good because it has witty original characters that actually <allcaps> change </allcaps> at the end of every movie !	1
" because men are " " privileged " " "	1
yeah , those rave reviews out of <allcaps> sxsw </allcaps> and it being 100% on rotten tomatoes really is him not keeping up to his crazy great filmography .	1
pleb , you probably have not even seen a roeg film !	1
they gotta put dennis leary in dumbo now or it ' ll automatically be garbage .	1
rich doctor ? pfft <elongated> , have you not heard of their student loan debt levels ?	1
even the sixth sense ?	1
another feminist movie starting charlize theron . this will be great	1
except the fight with no bridge , took it straight out of history books	1
" what is this " " good " " . i thought on r / movies movies could only be amazing or shit . "	1
hate them	1
because the mandarin is such an iconic and treasured character in our culture . of course they do . the mandarin ' s sacred .	1
all elves look alike anyways .	1
yeah , there would have been tons of lighting and catering in pre - production	1
<allcaps> no way </allcaps> ! <repeated> i thought the whole movie was just a really good tricky camera shot that they did well	1
" lol . i see what you did there . in all seriousness though , you should watch " " the great train robbery ( 1903 ) " " when it gets to u.k. cinemas next week ! "	1
<allcaps> but </allcaps> . <repeated> where are the explosions ? gun fights ? car chases ? i thought those <allcaps> had </allcaps> to be in trailers ? . <repeated>	1
yeah this will work	1
speaking of , paul mooney made a wayne brady joke on chappelle ' s show and in a later episode brady appears as himself in some sketch no one saw or quoted . probably one of the least known .	1
yeah , white people are so oppressed , right ?	1
what are you talking about ? asians have their own entire genre .	1
lol well this is obviously going to be a financial success !	1
yeah i want to side with earth . <repeated> but i really identify with sheng tsung , you know , taking souls and living forever and stuff . i was really disappointed with the tournament results .	1
well , everyone gets a pass on their first murder . once lex kills his parents , he will understand it felt bad and he will not do it any more .	1
true , it is like hawaii , it is not actually the <allcaps> usa </allcaps> , they only pledged allegiance or something .	1
<allcaps> now </allcaps> they have crossed a line !	1
<allcaps> ok now you guys messed with something really important here </allcaps>	1
sharknado . <repeated> i mean the <allcaps> cgi </allcaps> in those movies far surpass the hobbit	1
but my dad liked david bowie so i will never make fun of him even if the principle i have a problem with applies to him / pink floyd / zeppelin etc .	1
you are a snowflake and that is not the general consensus of reddit	1
wasn ' t it a prototype or something ? or maybe it was a social commentary and gender identity	1
and they can <allcaps> only </allcaps> enjoy the movie i like . <allcaps> nothing else </allcaps> .	1
yeah . ridley scott is great at comedy .	1
but can not you imagine the same fake alternate history that makes everything a comic book ? i mean come on imagine if afflek and damon had written good will hunting as a comic book !	1
lol , way to spoil the ending of the second movie .	1
<allcaps> this is why white actors can </allcaps> ' <allcaps> t find work </allcaps> ! <repeated>	1
i am sure its gonna be a box office hit , just like the starving games was .	1
but thats the original trilogy . its imperfections make it great .	1
wait , there is no gravity in space ? how the hell do planets even planet !	1
well , i did not knew that futurama owns everything that they create . the next time i see a robot drinking a beer or being an asshole , i will say that it ' s a fucking copy of bender . chappie is a rip - off !	1
enjoying the plot of course !	1
yeah , i mean , it ' s not like glasses are cute or anything , right ? total turn - off	1
hollywood is so original it hurts	1
i am so happy to see an adam sandler action movie !	1
well , there ' s always the strain .	1
good job being original	1
a great example of why the movie sucks , i can not wait for the <allcaps> cgi </allcaps> remake . just like how the new hobbit films are better than the fellowship trilogy , and sw 1 - 3 is better than hope / empire / jedi .	1
when studios realized that if a movie did well enough they could just make a sequel regardless if it made sense to the overall story .	1
yeah , not another teen movie was wonderful .	1
exactly , you are supposed to judge films by honest trailers .	1
jake lloyd , by far ! he just had such gravitas , really bringing out the depth of character that george lucas wrote for anakin !	1
but i am an engineer and i claim what you are saying would never happen ( despite the fact i will not tell you what type of engineer i am and what companies i have worked for , nor what role i played in them . )	1
whoops . forgot i am not allowed to have an opinion .	1
oh my , i totally wasn ' t expecting this .	1
ah yes , loki , he is <emphasis> known for smoking is not he ?	1
yeah - all 2 0 s of screen time that got really ruined the movie	1
or get shia labeouf , he ' s played harrison ' s son before !	1
check your cisgender privilege , both of you .	1
good for you .	1
it ' s a disney movie after all !	1
from none of the trailers or posters have we seen max looking back at the camera while his body faces away . <repeated> pretty new .	1
there ' s more than a title ?	1
clooney could not make it ?	1
it ' ll be fun to see johnny depp as dumbo and helena bonham carter as the bearded lady !	1
how can you not remember ? it ' s the most memorable final shot in film history !	1
what i want to know is : why was he mentally focusing so much on giving her breast cancer ? that does not seem very nice .	1
weird , cause i would expect someone who was in a terrible movie triage and had some otherwise tiny roles to have a huge ego .	1
of course it is . you see movies that target white males are natural while movies that dont are obviously gimmicky .	1
nice how that web site used an x - men cover with artwork by gil kane and dave cockrum .	1
did you know it took 12 years to make ?	1
nope , all movies must be like how marvel does them . this is not open for discussion	1
yeah guys lets downvote him for asking question !	1
sh <elongated> do not say that . interstellar is the best thing to happen to the world	1
who needs a script when you are neill blomkamp	1
but it ' s like jaws <emphasis> , spielberg did it first .	1
according to him , you raped spiderman .	1
ya i mean idk why there is so much fuss about this harrison ford guy , why does no one care about han solo ! <repeated>	1
two female characters . one dies of a ' broken heart ' because her husband dies and she apparently has no reason to to live anymore , and the other gives up all idea of being a warrior and settles down to be a nice housewife . fantastic , would not want to interrupt the sausage party .	1
oh yeah because it was so obvious	1
oh yeah . that definitely cleared it right up .	1
hot redhead in lingerie and thats <allcaps> not </allcaps> your takeaway ?	1
another super hero movie , we definately do not have enough of them already	1
because he singlehandedly ruined our childhoods !	1
hollywood want muniez . how long you think they can feed people on marvel franchise ?	1
because it wasn ' t his favorite movie , and therefore its success is unfounded .	1
illuminati !	1
considering they be pushing spidey in the <allcaps> mcu </allcaps> so heavily and the <allcaps> mcu </allcaps> ' s fondness of ding origin ' s i think they might increase the running time to 3 . 5 hours so they can use 2 hours on uncle ben getting shot a third time , since we got 2 origin stories already third time ' s the charm right !	1
like exodus <emphasis>	1
oh hurray . <repeated> another will ferrell movie . that guy is just the funniest .	1
" thank goodness you said " " black kid " " or that story would have made no sense . "	1
roger moore was hands down the best bond	1
yeah , right ; hardly anything wrong with that movie .	1
i bet you hate it when people talk during movies too ! you monster !	1
atleast he tried	1
yeah , by this logic we should ban all cars . too many assholes might cut you off or do other dangerous acts .	1
really ? i thought people hated phantom menace ?	1
how can this not fail ?	1
but man he ' s way too cool <elongated> to be peter parker	1
i have to admit , i did not notice it the first time . must ' ve been bradley ' s entrancing eyes .	1
what are you talking about ? those posters are very professional looking .	1
typical witch hate propaganda .	1
yeah , cause * dark knight * , * spider - man 2 * , * captain america : the winter soldier * , * how to train your dragon 2 * , * terminator 2 * and * the empire strikes back * were all way worse than their predecessors .	1
haha . you funny man .	1
personally , i would have no way of knowing what sarcasm looks like on reddit , because i have never been exposed to the internet before . thank you	1
first movie , david bowie . second movie , justin bieber . just when i thought they could not make the movie any better , they pull this out .	1
well , the last 3 superman films were pretty depressing , too .	1
clearly these old bonds are better than the new ones	1
thank god vanilla ice cleared this up for us . now i can watch this movie conscience free . his opinions on the treatment of native american stereotypes in cinema is valuable .	1
yeah , fuck the kids and the house . she wasn ' t into the movie and asked a dumb question , fuck that i am out .	1
but he did not know the sponge was s ' posed to be wet !	1
yep , that ' s exactly right . that ' s why he went out of his way to marry a 21 year old in his lifetime .	1
laughing at that is laughing at america . you better take your commie ass elsewhere .	1
but she ' s a lesbian , not a filthy homo	1
yeah , that ' s not childish and unprofessional at all .	1
yes you have to be crazed social justice warrior to think racists are fucking absurd .	1
because all white people are actually racist and pissed that selma <emphasis> was made .	1
gravity , now there ' s a good movie .	1
does it include even more focus shots on the audi badge of cars cause i do not think i got enough of them .	1
wow , until he mentioned it i did not even notice the tattoo .	1
who ?	1
i think ill just wait for jurassic world to get the gist of it .	1
christopher nolan is such an underrated director .	1
but everybody <emphasis> knows that millennials are total narcissists and they will only watch a movie if you make it all about them . if spidey ' s not doing hot power yoga , they are out !	1
oh yeah , daredevil was definitely fun and flashy .	1
<allcaps> but its so bad and not a superman movie i should know i watched the donner film twice </allcaps> ! <repeated> <allcaps> twice </allcaps> ! <repeated>	1
an offensive adam sandler movie ? wow ! that a real shock ! i mean , who could have possibly predicted such an outrageous thing ?	1
yeah that never happens to white people .	1
no , they were peaceful , loving people .	1
lighten up ass holes , it ' s a comedy . not everything will be as good as dances with wolves .	1
have fun watching the poltergeist remake then ! <laugh>	1
if only they did this 500 years ago . <repeated>	1
painting white people to look like native americans so they can make fun of them . that sounds like a totally okay thing to do .	1
it ' s ok guys , they got rob schnieder ! just paint him brown and stick a few feathers in his cap and its comedy magic !	1
yeah because white people can not experience racism . only brown or black people can know what it is like to be discriminated against .	1
yeah ! fuck the americans who actually made those movie and tv shows ! they should have to see it after everyone else !	1
and a stabbable shoulder	1
i am not sure if i like it . could he maybe have some pirate clothes on instead and maybe be tied to a tree ?	1
so is depp playing jack sparrow again ? because i will not go and see a depp film unless he plays a version of himself as jack sparrow .	1
what ? you didnt love his blackface obama skits ?	1
they could use <allcaps> cgi </allcaps> on him to make him look younger	1
well , duh . yeah . how else would you clean out the inside of the oven ?	1
movie theaters pay so well and do not see employees as expendable cattle	1
you can not prove that purple dickbutts do not live in the core of the sun so it is a completely plausible premise for my film with my artistic license .	1
<allcaps> but jurassic park is amazimg and it made my childhood and your an asshole for saying anything bad about it </allcaps>	1
get that logic outta hear ! <repeated>	1
i like how menacing it looks . some nipples would be nice , though . <annoyed>	1
white men should just stop going to the movies so they can be made for another audience .	1
yes now that we know something will go wrong at jurassic park it ' s ruined	1
so advertising brainwashes you and allows you not to make your own decisions .	1
right , because johnny storm ' s race is equally important to his character as black panther ' s .	1
freddy from hoc calls her his daughter so i am inclined to believed they are unless blacks and whites can not be related now	1
i demand to see his birth certificate ! damn illegals	1
strange . <repeated> i could have sworn he ' s done quite a few films since the 6 th sense and signs , wonder why they were left off the poster .	1
i am expecting a staff writer position offer any minute now	1
you do not like michael b jordan as johnny storm ? ur a racist lol	1
but i thought doom was supposed to be a dumb blogger ! <repeated>	1
tyler perry	1
but bat - nipples !	1
yeah , let us connect it to an incident from 14 years ago . makes totally sense	1
ordinary people	1
the star wars prequels were amazing too ! <repeated>	1
ikr ? avengers and harry potter are way more realistic	1
considering you are active on the league of legends subreddit i hope that you are in high school because that is * so childish *	1
does this mean i will have to come in on saturday ? cuz that ' ll be great <emphasis> .	1
" this will be as great as " " the watchmen " " or " " man of steel " " "	1
ikr , they should be holding hands and skipping around .	1
that ' s just sad , i was expecting the first hour to be about how bruce wayne became batman	1
this comment is so <elongated> stupid . she did not kill them she just knocked them around a bit . ugh , some ppl .	1
yeah , nolan is so <elongated> underrated . why does no one like his work ?	1
thanks for sharing . that ' s one of the <emphasis> classic hollywood stories .	1
ohh , boo hoo . okay i will not watch this ugly film anymore . thanks for warning us .	1
yeah , they should totally make a movie with none of the stuff the fans want ! maybe introduce some new comic relief slapstick characters , the latest in cgi and balance that out by focussing on something riveting like an intergalactic trade embargo , sounds like a winning formula !	1
this film is nowhere near an oscar therefore i must hate it	1
yeah that batman vs . superman teaser was <allcaps> amazing </allcaps> !	1
not gonna lie . <repeated> i will be a little disappointed if there is not one lightsaber wielding jar - jar sighting now .	1
yeah because <allcaps> imdb </allcaps> is reliable source	1
that ' s , like , only your opinion man . <repeated>	1
that ' s a nice interesting little concept . but it is too . <repeated> difficult . time consuming . and frankly , i do not believe audiences are smart enough to comprehend the message of such a teaser like you exemplified . i would rather make a trailer that reveals the entire plot and every little detail about the movie , with shitty orchestra music , lots of re - hashed one liners ( the dumb masses need to understand this is a terminator movie , so throw it about a dozen ' i will be back ' and ' come with my if you want to live ' and ' you are terminated ' etc )	1
that ' s crazy . <repeated> i can not think of jaws without thinking of bergman - and vice versa .	1
you can not like both marvel and dc movies . thats insane ! why would anyone hope that both companies put out quality movies for the enjoyment of their fans !	1
owen wilson can finally make his silver screen comeback .	1
cant believe it beat fifty first dates psh <elongated>	1
man how dumb would that be !	1
but are they a woman ? ! <repeated> that ' s what really matters .	1
no that is ms . marvel now . come on ! get your shit together tyron !	1
but she ' s a quirky gamer chick , ugh ! it ' s perfect !	1
nah dude science is just a bunch of haters who are wrong anyways because they dont know what we are gonna find out in the future that will disprove what we know now ! duh !	1
. <repeated> but i did not even mention moon	1
woah , i do not remember the last time i saw two members of the avengers fight because one of them was mind controlled .	1
yea , because the united states would totally level new york	1
donald glover <laugh>	1
because american ' s are not smart and cultured .	1
but . <repeated> but , how will we know how spider - man got his powers ?	1
everything has been done before , so why bother <allcaps> amirite </allcaps> ? ! <repeated>	1
yep , they dyed his hair green . he ' s the joker .	1
yeah . because a movie ' s narrative pacing and its total run time are totally mutually exclusive .	1
it is true toy story 2 and 3 were terrible , terrible movie !	1
i am just hoping nobody dies in this movie because that gives me nightmares	1
yes . you are literally the only person in human existence who would be confused by this .	1
do not worry , dc seems to be restricting the use of characters like deadshot and deathstroke as they are brought into the movie universe . is not that great ? ! <repeated> you get to lose your characters slowly !	1
no , i am sure the music video / hunger games director wont churn out manufactured hollywood garbage and tarnish the meaning of the first epic for new generations .	1
what sequel ?	1
tom hardy for picard !	1
summed it up perfectly !	1
haha funny bro	1
guys , guys , arnold is getting older , is still pretty ripped , and has a beard . that means he should play joel in a the last of us movie right ?	1
my local theater charges 18$ but that ' s okay because in switzerland we are all rich as fuck .	1
right i mean i am the only one leftover from my home planet . <repeated> no one on earth i can relate to . <repeated> and i was supposed to conquer the whole place but decided to be its guardian . <repeated> yeah can totally understand the entire not brooding thing .	1
depends how that adam sandler film does .	1
but <elongated> . <repeated> they are robots . obviously there ' s no way audiences could just . <repeated> relate to someone not like them ! can you imagine if the spent half of the movie not even talking , just wandering around doing robot things and beeping ? ! <repeated> there ' s no way a movie with a robot protagonist could sell ! <repeated>	1
he did comment on the casting of ben affleck though , i would say he did quite a lot already	1
click was a really good drama of his !	1
* le tips fedora *	1
jesus christ that ' s subtle .	1
yeah every other remake of an 80 ' s movie has been awesome and improved upon the original .	1
sure they can , they just have to jump to grandma age , just like helen mirren and meryl streep .	1
i know , scarlett johansson ' s in both of them ! ^^^ ^^^	1
oh cmon guys . <repeated> the corporate magic movie formula always <emphasis> works . <repeated> and if it does not it ' s because of those dirty pirates .	1
how does it compare to schindler ' s list ? i have been meaning to see this movie .	1
damn , first chris pratt , now nolan ? these guys are really taken to reddit today , eh ?	1
i am sure all the <allcaps> cgi </allcaps> technicians that worked on the film feel the same way .	1
pacific rim should have been so good that it won 10 oscars .	1
wow , great argument .	1
when did leo work with scorsese ? haha	1
b-b - b - but practical effects !	1
peter dinklage is type casted though . he always plays a dwarf !	1
* * <allcaps> spoilers man </allcaps> , <allcaps> jeezus christ </allcaps> ! <repeated> * *	1
he was great in interstellar !	1
that appeared to be a 7 / 11 . there are no 7 / 1 1 s in minnesota . terrible movie	1
not that often you see count dooku and grand moff tarkin in the same pic	1
i wonder if kevin bacon is the bad guy	1
yep because they eviscerated max at the end , right ?	1
<allcaps> vhs </allcaps> tapes have so much more warmth <emphasis> than dvds .	1
nope ! they are all black so they are all the same !	1
spoilers , goddammit .	1
that was the following .	1
it ' s rough and irritating also	1
someone did not get the memo that old stuff is always better than new stuff .	1
jaden	1
wow that kick would not have the force to knock the dinasaur through a boarded up window . she did not even land it center - of - mass	1
i am excited to see a montage with 70 ' s disco music .	1
yeah , shakespeare is such a niche thing . who the fuck reads anyway , amirite ? i gots me some <allcaps> gta </allcaps> to play , bitch !	1
well maybe lavey would have enjoyed the new johnny depp movie , * black mass * .	1
yeah , they should have cast him as white because it ' s gonna make little black kids upset .	1
maybe on a bee inside a piece of amber	1
yeah when i was watching avatar i did not even notice !	1

i hope the <allcaps> aclu </allcaps> will then address the bigger systemic inequality in hollywood hiring practices which is that jewish individuals are vastly overrepresented , i hope we can remove this systemic bias against gentiles by suing companies whose employees are more than 1.4% jewish ( proportionate to the national demographic )	1

the phantom menace	1
" lol . okay . let us not pretend that you are being downvoted for your opinion . on reddit , the way to disagree with people and not get downvoted is to disagree respectfully . and , not shockingly , your comments that disagree respectfully are upvoted . what gets downvoted are the lines like " " . <repeated> the show magically stops being the piece of shit i have been watching . <repeated> " " and " " season 1 was like a bowl of butt fungus and season two was just a bowl of fungus .

i think the mick jagger one is more historically accurate	1
i did not like how jaws was all about that shark swimming around and eating people . such a ridiculous premise .	1

yeah . it ' s not like hans has plenty of projects anyway .	1
wow , such a great casting choice .	1
yeah , same for gone girl and fight club . extremely predictable thanks to the book .	1
" you know , he directed " " fright night , " " " " child ' s play , " " and " " the langoliers . " " thought they would go younger with the casting though , he is in his 7 0 s now . "	1

dude if people had their feet up , it would totally ruin the movie experience with all those feet shadows clotting up the screen .	1
good for spielberg , he needed that .	1
because you should just see the movie and enjoy it you pleb ! what is wrong with you ? ! <repeated>	1
do not you realize that your opinion is wrong ? that you are enjoying things you are not supposed to ?	1

racebending in hollywood has gone too far . marlon brando has always <emphasis> been white in the comics .	1
this time he ' s a villain , so there ' s nothing wrong with it .	1
i do not appreciate you being funnier than me	1
bullshit , he died because he was a lardassed land whale do not u kno ?	1
too bad . if only he was fat he might have lived longer	1
shsh <elongated> . <repeated> spoilers	1
the <allcaps> fbi </allcaps> has its priorities straight	1
yea it all happened because john candy turned down a role . damn him .	1
you still have not seen t2 ?	1
" you mean having the character say " " yay " " every few minutes does not add dimension ? it ' s an inspired way to avoid actually writing about thoughts and feelings . "	1
do not worry , i am sure there ' s a twist somewhere that makes it all worthwhile	1
nice , could have used a spoiler tag for anyone that has not seen it .	1
right because uwe boll has made a single good movie that would merit massive crowd funding	1
i have not seen american sniper but you perfectly describe how i felt about in the line of fire a million years ago when it was out . i guess it ' s eastwood ' s style , man !	1
it ' s true . guys always go to movies by ourselves and never ask anyone else if they want to go see it with us .	1
yeah , god forbid i want movies to be treated like art	1
its as underrated as edge of tomorrow is on reddit	1
oh great ! we had a perfectly good movie with a woman and a black man as the lead roles and then a * white male * had to show up and ruin everything !	1
he should have given it up	1
and yet , here was the signal from a trusted authority * on the planet itself * saying it ' s a great place to stay . one wonders why they took the chance . it was just the final mission to save humankind , after all .	1
no women are only equal to men if they have bionic arms	1
yeah , what was shakespeare thinking with iago ?	1

with all the shrimpish men out there , it ' s frankly unbelievable that women have not been in power for centuries . not buying it .	1
meryl ' s going for that 4 th oscar .	1
yeah but think about the possibilities . james bond appearing in disney infinity with a paintball gun ( you know for kids ) and be super serious and quippy or better yet have mickey mouse for disneyland / world promotions pose as james bond .	1
not like a language changes in 600 years . no sir it stays exactly the same	1
be careful man , this guy majored in media studies	1
it ' ll go to inside out because it deals with mental illness	1

we need to support original films like tron 3 so we can get more original films ( like tron 4 ) .	1
<allcaps> omg </allcaps> , that scene was so gay	1
i fail to see why this would surprise anyone . as one female pundit put it , people want to watch those they ' d like to fuck . i do not know why this is blowing anyone ' s minds , but women tend to go for older men and men for younger women . shocking , i know .	1
" oh yay , i can not wait for john cena in the new " " they live " " . "	1
<allcaps> til </allcaps> leonardo dicaprio had other roles after * growing pains * .	1
are you stupid or something ? any movie with black people that are not serving white people ( or at least magical negro ) is total reverse racism , anti - white , kanye <allcaps> bullshit </allcaps> . just like if a movie has a woman who is not doing everything in her power to help her husband / boyfriend , she is obviously a tumblr posting , feminazi , manhating , bitch who friendzoned nice guys like you or me .	1

ya , why can not the us figure out mental illness like the rest of the first world ? they do not have mass shootings , so they must not have mental health issues .	1
well , does not being muslim mean you are violent and crazy anyways ?	1
we should come up with a schedule for drugs and make some of them unavailable without a perscription or something . maybe that would help fix the drug problem in america . <repeated>	1

i am glad reynolds is enthusiastically taking to twitter to promote another comic book property turned film . all of his others have been top notch !	1
you are right , i forgot this was a shot for shot adaptation of your favorite joker & harley story arc and not an independent movie open to interpretation , my bad .	1

nah dude the 30 lines of shitty forced jokes / puns in every fucking front page post are hilarious .	1
yeah , i ' d love to hear this in front of her or saving private ryan	1
yup . totally is .	1
because banning movies has always been so successful at quashing public interest in them .	1
but movies with flying people are more realistic when people die and its glossed over like nothing happened .	1
yeah , argo was * so <elongated> * bad . can not believe anyone would think that movie was even remotely good . and fuck me he was excruciating to watch in gone girl , right ? or the countless number of other critically praised movies he ' s been in , * * fuck that * * .	1
clearly since he was such a pivotal character to the plot	1
nothing more funny than watching a woman hit a man . it makes me so proud to see how society encourages and finds entertaining the prospect of women using violence against men .	1
oh god , you re such a nerd	1
michael b . jordan , stealing yet another white man job .	1
was hoping for a scott stapp biopic .	1
" a zak efron movie targeted at " " millennials " " ? ! <repeated> who could have ever foreseen this movie flopping ? "	1
and he has a kenyan accent !	1

" " " but the one i listed is more like 2.5 acts " " "	1
really ? it is star wars ! i think it is obvious that guess might be a little conservative	1
but do not you understand ? we need to see those commentators from the pod race now <emphasis> . what have they been up to ? how can i be a fan if there is even an ounce of world building that is not explained to death and has the mystery sucked dry from it ? this is what george lucas never understood !	1
at least i got you and your comments . thanks for being there , dude .	1
we will all be worse off for not seeing the glorious aunt may spinoff movie	1
how dare she be charitable in africa ! does not she know that her money belongs in america and no place else ? fuck oprah for fighting sexism and lack of education in the third world and you know what fuck george clooney for trying to prevent genocide in darfur .	1

<allcaps> you </allcaps> ' <allcaps> re just too dumb to get it </allcaps> !	1

does not matter . came in under budget .	1
cause dicaprio was so <elongated> good in great gatsby .	1
<allcaps> chimichangas lel </allcaps> <laugh>	1

just like how real swordsmen constantly hit themselves with the hilt .	1
zodiac . they should have caught the killer after decades of looking . <repeated>	1
at what point is it not a teaser anymore ? this gave away the whole plot .	1
splinter from ninja turtles does look like the stereotypical oriental person with his tattered clothes , living in a sewer and has a pointy nose and squinty rat eyes	1
yeah , cuz the <allcaps> mcu </allcaps> is known for great storytelling with real , grounded , emotional scenes .	1
honestly , who is not ? those movies are art .	1
like ashton kutcher	1
nah man , slavery ended in 1865 and there was nothing <emphasis> that happened afterward that maintained white superiority and racial violence against black people . former slave owners were more than happy to peacefully coexist with people that they owned a short time prior .	1
no it does not and you are obviously a worse person than me for holding that opinion .	1
yeah , the social network and the wolf of wall street are two of the worst movies i have ever seen .	1
but they abuse the environment they must abuse their families !	1
you ever notice how la is not like ny ? crash is so deep .	1
also , the lord of the rings movies must have actually taken place in middle earth , and not in new zealand or on a sound stage , right ? i mean , there are constant references to places like the shire and mordor , and i have seen a map of new zealand and i do not see those on there anywhere <emphasis> .	1
draft day ?	1

star wars will for sure get best picture . no doubt .	1
you are not ready to spend the day fighting over it ? why are you even on this subreddit ?	1
this is the first time i have heard anyone say anything bad about uncharted ' s story . people have their opinions so whatever , but uncharted ' s story has been critically acclaimed . to say it ' s not amazing , or it ' s not even good is honestly bullshit . you can not tell me uncharted does not have a great story . the characters are interesting and have motives . the story makes sense and it ' s the closest thing you can get to becoming indiana jones . <repeated> but i am sure since it ' s a video game it can not be good . video games are for children and should never be taken seriously .	1
oh , thank god for this post , or millions of people would have missed this movie . it ' s not like it has several huge <emphasis> names attached to it or is talked about frequently in the media . you are a fucking movie savior <emphasis> , op . thank you for alerting us to this carefully hidden , obscure gem .	1

better to see every movie ever made and then decide for yourself	1

1991 , * house party 2 * . you know , back in the day when there were not sequels to everything .	1

you got so many ideas . you should direct ep 9 .	1

no all romance in movies is automatically shoehorned and unnecessary	1

yeah sure , he ' s a great actor .	1
no , because that ' s too easy and it makes sense .	1
they all look the same to me .	1
what does hank hill ' s dog have to do with this ?	1
but the movie wasn ' t <allcaps> deep </allcaps> enough ! <repeated> <sad> i need my action movies to have a deep and complicated plot like schindler ' s list because that ' s what makes an <allcaps> action </allcaps> movie .	1

if you ask my redneck brother and his redneck family , they all think god got robbed because american sniper should have won	1
spielberg is the worst director ever for copying the vertigo shot in jaws . and scorsese for the entire plot of the departed .	1
right , it should have had a sprawling worldwide international conspiracy plot with twists and turns and betrayals and 20 more characters and an hour of exposition and backstory and subplots . that would have automatically made it 1 0 x better	1
transformers has pretty good action sequences . i have found that all michael bay movies do , actually .	1
" you did not think , " " let us free the water by driving here and back " " was detailed ? "	1

" he said it " " wasn ' t a color issue " " . do you seriously need more proof ? "	1
better cast every role in hollywood with wrestlers	1
you mean . <repeated> matt damon is not brooding throughout ? what a load of fucking shit .	1
it ' s a police officer watching them	1
it ' s so rare that the movie studios listen and respond so perfectly to the demands of the people , but it ' s finally happening !	1
yeah they might as well pull it from theaters and burn the prints . after all there ' s no way there can be room for 2 different kinds of popular movies	1
exactly , fucking do nothing bitch	1
well it would be just tragic if the female lead was older than the male .	1
hopefully they make a john wick 2 paid <allcaps> dlc </allcaps> for payday <annoyed> ^ )	1
you can get lasik surgery on amazon . i hear they have a two for one deal .	1

no man , do not you know that in literally anything else they would have cg ' ed her to look 22 and given her dd tits too ? ! <repeated> it ' s just like how in the james bond movies they made judi dench look like a supermodel , because hollywood is so misogynistic .	1

it ' s a good thing there ' s people on the internet to provide the cold hard facts needed to prove the validity of their points	1
he ' s signed up for a role where he plays a senior college student who needs to get his shit together or else he will not graduate . there ' s a b plot where hanks shows an adorkable 19 year old actress that she is beautiful by taking off her glasses and putting her hair down .	1

yea , if you are not a famous actor then your life is meaningless ! brought to by <allcaps> tmztm </allcaps>	1
it ' s clearly the only far fetched thing in any of of these movies .	1
do not you get how totally the one butt joke ruined a serious movie about comical villain , exploding heads , super secret teenage spy academy and about 8 people maintaining a massive hangar full of super complicated military tech that probably mostly doesnt work anymore ?	1
but they are classics !	1
the marlins were also supposed to be an al team , better pack up and go home i guess	1
well obviously	1
yeah fuck shawshank , the green mile , stand by me , running man , the stand , it , carrie , and missery he needs kubrick to make any of his stories work on film	1

pulp fiction , shawshank redemption , forrest gump . god , what a horrible year .	1
<allcaps> oh my god so cool <elongated> </allcaps> .	1
yeah but where ' s luke ?	1
um , it was a bit obvious to me . i mean , it ' s real right ?	1
i am sad , i expected to see jar jar	1
all of that footage was actually preshooted in the studio and the news were hacked so they put the preshooted footage instead of the real footage in . also all of the supposed witnesses were hired actors and in fact there was nobody in the buildings during the demoliton . wake up sheeple .	1
yay , more people supporting the industry . <repeated>	1
nobody should bash you for not having good taste	1

so it is somewhat autobiographical ?	1
<allcaps> wow </allcaps> . an announcement to a movie trailer . this is so exciting	1
i am glad the trailer comes out right before the tickets go on sale , in case the new footage causes me to change my mind about seeing the movie .	1
it ' s an event <emphasis> that ' s different from other movie releases !	1
but are not the male co - stars typically older ? they would have a lot more experience .	1
oh gosh . i hope i am not too late to jump on the anti franco rogen train ! shit , i can not remember if the circle jerk loves or hates tommy . i will just leave that out and echo whatever anyone with lots of upvotes has to say .	1

ratings are legal and binding !	1
well maybe we should not be using a <allcaps> wwe </allcaps> mid - carder ' s opinion on movies to begin with .	1
man , the sequel was so much better than the original . i just can not watch the original anymore cuz the sequel does <allcaps> everything </allcaps> better .	1
makes sense . you hit the nail on the head with that one	1
whoa man , no need to be such a sp .	1
nah , socialised medicine is an orwellian state system that let people like him and stephen hawking die	1
yes , but by virtue of being a biopic , it automatically is not deserving of academy awards .	1
no no , i watched the rest after the plane landed . although there might be a part of me that wishes it had not .	1
because a dark and gritty batman movie is not a one - hundred percent guaranteed box - office goldmine . that ' s why * batman and robin * bombed .	1
well , to be fair , new trailers come out all the time so the answer could change from week to week .	1
fucking hipster .	1
another austrian saves the day !	1
ohh yeah , definitely not a coverup by <allcaps> nbc </allcaps>	1
well that ' s the part that needs to be fixed . do not worry , i am sure once the copyright expires on all those films they can be released in an open format .	1
not true , there is like three positions for old businessmen a year .	1

but transformers is literally the reason we are not getting pacific rim 2 !	1
but at least the rapping white kid was good	1
wow , i would * never <emphasis> * have thought of it that way .	1
did she do the painting with the dogs ?	1
probably because he misses pesci	1
you will listen and believe ! you will want to see her tits . you will obey the right answer	1
right , because we are talking about the books in this movie <emphasis> subreddit and people typically think of the books when james bond is mentioned	1
right , similar to how it ' s pretty erroneous of blacklivesmatter to label themselves with black people if they are so concerned with race relations .	1
well , it wasn ' t a sequel in a well known franchise . who the hell would want to see that ?	1
what does he know ? he ' s just falling for russell ' s oscar bait	1
especially that dude who played obi wan . never seen him before . like wtf had he ever done . am i right ?	1
haha exactly ! plus i can not downvote my friends shitty opinions .	1
dear john , channing tatum , amazing performance .	1
because all teens are grown up now	1
uh oh ! somone is not agreeing with the circle jerk ! <allcaps> quick guys downvote him </allcaps> ! <repeated>	1
you mean christoph waltz play the same character in yet another movie ? <repeated>	1
what ' s the symbolism of this taking place in a graveyard for communist monuments ? seems too subtle for a james bond movie	1
wow , thanks for the spoiler !	1
parties are lame	1
aww man i was hoping for nc - 17	1
i think we should only have women protagonists in remakes of female films	1
ya . please do not overpay me to do a huge blockbuster , with tons of exposure , where for most of the movie i stand around and people pretend i am in all the action scenes .	1
he was in , like , every scene .	1
that ' s a shame , i was hoping ride along would be great	1
another super hero movie . <repeated> yay .	1
who is in the all black costume ? is that catwoman ?	1
his name is bucky	1
a trailer not revealing the entire plot of a movie ? that ' s madness !	1
i heard he put on weight for the role	1
" are you from vancouver ? <tong> " " i am canadian " " referencing cold weather . "	1
so he just let nature do all the work ? what a bum .	1
nah , fuck your friends and your job and your house , just move you fucking pansy !	1
running time : 738 min .	1
wow . did not see that coming	1
wait stop no come back	1
yeah but at least that did not have a retarded title	1
they gotta get the asian guy calm down some more .	1
sorry , no oscar yet for him	1
it ' s ok because both khans were cisgender scum .	1
the real question is why do you keep inviting people over and showing robocop to people ?	1
well we have all seen one image and several seconds of footage , so its clearly time to talk about how terrible she will be in the role .	1
hey i am not sensitive ! <repeated> how dare you think that !	1
no , you are completely wrong . zoolander himself is a perfectly accurate portrayal of the white , cis - male : dumb , ignorant of his white privilege , rich and powerful and also appropriating the culture of other people by sometimes wearing clothes which could be described as ethnic .	1
yeah giving away his company and letting star wars evolve away from his vision and then donating all his earnings to charity really shows how he ' s never been humble .	1
no i needed to read this guys comment about his mini epiphany	1
come on , we all know an extremely skinny actress can fulfill the role of a fit , maybe even muscular heroine ! just look at street fighter : the legend of chun - li !	1
can not tell if	1
you are obviously putting armageddon in the fantastic category right ?	1
yeah . those fucking jews .	1
thought it was <allcaps> vhs </allcaps>	1
<allcaps> goldeneye </allcaps> was so campy	1
they made presales still completely optional ? oh no , games and movies are ruined !	1
yep . <repeated> that han solo origin film is really gonna distance this stuff from the ot .	1
yeah , the minimum wage projector boy should tell a movie studio how to distribute their multi - hundred million dollar movie . they obviously have never thought about timing issues before this guy started crying .	1
you did not have the 2 0 0 0 s classics like the dark knight , whiplash , or drive ; that ' s why !	1
yeah instead it ' s scored by that amateur , morricone .	1
yeah , now we all know the truth of lionsgates evil master plan . thank you op for liberating us	1
these ship thru my hub at least once a week to which i handle them with the up most care and concern .	1
it might mean that a large corporation get ' s less money though , which is way worse than violence	1
i will have my lightsaber ready to cut your fucking head off if something wrong . it ' s not your fault but hey , you are there . i can not cut off disney ' s head can i ?	1

b - but they are a <allcaps> movie </allcaps> company , and that guy wanted <allcaps> movie </allcaps> stuff . what ' s so hard about that ? <allcaps> fuck </allcaps> the corporations , dude . they should be forced to cater to anyone who wants anything from them , no matter how trivial or misguided their request .	1
i am sure this will be as hilarious <emphasis> as anchorman 2 .	1
what a shocking development . i did not see this coming at all .	1
yeah just like he ruined the martian	1
castle .	1
it ' s okay , they are horror enthusiasts . <repeated> that ' s qualification enough	1
it actually might be more of a plotline than a storyline	1
memento , i do not know what i ' d change , i just hope someone remakes it .	1
you are right though . only a moron would think y was a fucking vowel ! <repeated>	1
yeah , but you guys produced von trier who causes us enough headaches with ratings so i do not know that we want to use your system .	1
i do not know why people look at spoilers . i do not look at spoilers . i do not want to see anything more about this film until i am in the seat at the theater . is not this comment interesting and useful ? do not you * care <emphasis> * ?	1
exactly . <repeated> a touch - screen equivalent of clicking on a desktop window and moving it aside , bringing something else to the focal point of the user ' s field of vision . no computer user ever does that	1
you are gonna love spectre then !	1
oh yeah , definitely that one .	1
fant4stic	1
" cause it ' s the " " world " " series "	1
then the theaters will get called racist .	1
yeah , james cameron really ruined it .	1
so you are telling me that dc does not have any say over making spider - man r either ?	1
because we all <emphasis> know that 3 d printers are incredibly time / money efficient , and well - suited to large - scale production .	1
no sh <elongated> , let them feel good about themselves . the only reason we did not see the movie is because we hate steve jobs . it ' s definitely not because this does not look interesting at all or we just do not care about his life since we know his life story inside and out . it ' s all because he was mean and we are better than him .	1
no dide . every movie has to be citizen kane or casablanca . no fun movies are allowed you plebian .	1
yeah because we all remember that shitstorm that rained down on us when exodus came out a year ago . aside from the dozens of other films of it ' s like .	1
" deal . though , i might not want to miss out on the inevitable " " here ' s what we know about the force awakens so far " " piece "	1
hollywood movies being unoriginal ? nah <elongated>	1
no , no , no . <repeated> prometheus wasn ' t tied into the alien franchise at all ! not even a little ! <repeated>	1
yeah , i really need to know this .	1
making a biopic of one of a person that brought back a company on the brink of disaster and made it the wealthiest company in the world while completely transforming the way we see technology is a bad idea , yes	1
needs more marvel & star wars	1
what about that anime samurai 7 , is it a ripoff of seven samurai ?	1
it ' s set in duluth minnesota , actually . misleading marketing .	1
this clearly needed a sequel	1
because . <repeated> plotholes , and it sucked because it was stupid	1
he could support the fact that the main actor was black .	1
it ' s almost as if they were terminally ill when they watched it	1
i do not care how long it is , i will not watch this movie out of respect for our boys in blue .	1
yeah but he would need a steam key to unlock that valuable digital loot yo	1
it probably got cut from the movie when they realized how bad the special effects were .	1
well does anyone want my tickets i ain ' t watchin this crap anymore !	1
hey guys we need to totally mark this as <allcaps> nsfw </allcaps> cause you know someone could use their imagination and a 5 second clip and have the entire movie ruined for them ! <repeated>	1
i do not know how i have managed to live so long without them .	1
did not you just say it , * b <emphasis> * lack mass	1
thank you for accurately describing my opinions for me . i would have had no idea what to think if not for preachy internet strangers ! thank you !	1
and what about * hitman at *	1
but she did not make the <allcaps> most </allcaps> ! only then will there be true equality !	1
wow look at all that cgi , it does not even look real . shit movie .	1
yeah , and that movie was pretty much a flop .	1
assassins creed will blow the cgi in it looks retarded	1
yeah , and those movies sucked so bad no one every watched or liked them .	1
force ghosts !	1
obviously boyhood ! it took 12 years to make !	1
" oh so this kid gets special treatment just because he ' s " " dying of cancer " " and " " in constant agony " " ? news flash kid , we all got shit goin on . "	1
dude , do not you know ? you are supposed to hate the mad hatter and jar jar . <allcaps> we all </allcaps> hate the mad hatter and jar jar ! <repeated>	1
why can not we get a <allcaps> real </allcaps> american ? ! <repeated>	1
ugh , have not you been paying attention ? the force is made up of living creatures in your cells . of course they sleep . geez .	1
do not worry , i am sure someone out there will care , in a galaxy far , far , far , * far <emphasis> * away	1
though i think she needs some chapstick by the poster	1
so we are in for two more films of shitty two - demensional characters , ludicrous storylines and rubbish <allcaps> cgi </allcaps> . <repeated> * i can not wait *	1
hey , hemsworth was to that point the star of probably the worst <allcaps> mcu </allcaps> movie and a red herring in a shitty ________ ( vacation in this case ) from hell movie . so obviously he should be paid as much as a bankable star with an oscar .	1
how about an evil clone <emphasis> ?	1
yeah , relating it to one of the most popular series in a generation is really good hurt its performance in the box office	1
yeah , men in black ii followed this formula and turned out great !	1
wow , you clearly have seen the movie . that is exactly what the film is . just the ashton kutcher movie with michael fassbender . it ' s not like it has a completely different method of telling the story or better writing or better acting . it ' s just the exact same movie . you are so right .	1
it ' s just one big computer	1
he should focus on getting rid of that pg - 13 rating , it ' s probably eating into ticket sales - if they take out the gruesome off - screen deaths , it should be achievable .	1
" my dad never says bye he just says " " ok " " and hangs up . so this has always been immersive to me . "	1
oh and do not forget he ' s a holocaust survivor ! <repeated> cause that somehow excuses everything ! <repeated>	1
alien . glad they stopped at alien 3 and we could live our lives knowing they did not ruin it anymore than they did with that train wreck .	1
" no no , see it ' s a " " reboot " " ! that ' s makes it new and fresh ! just like when you reboot your computer to flush out all the bad crap ! "	1
thanks obama	1
i find it very incredibly hard to believe that people have different opinions	1
you see , only the u . s . matters .	1
but what about eragon , it was such a good movie .	1
right ? people who disagree with me deserve to be dead .	1
i think how to train your dragon did it better	1
well , that told me ever so much ! <allcaps> yay </allcaps> ! i can not wait !	1
you mean they did not cart in massive amounts of real gold for the movie ?	1
yeah cause there really needs to be more political dramas on tv .	1
another classic from uwe boll , fantastic director .	1
you had to wait so long for the blood though ! <repeated>	1
oh my god shawshank redemption and pulp fiction were made over a decade ago how do i answer this ? ! <repeated>	1
transformers ^ ^^^ ^^^ ^^^ ^^^ ^^^	1
yeah cause god forbid a normal person be excited for a movie . must be a shill .	1
no but he will become a villain in the next expansion instead	1
yeah i feel super triggered right now .	1
wow . <repeated> he comes off as a really , really humble guy	1
it ' s just a sci - fi ripoff of three amigos .	1
because it ' s not in japanese , duh .	1
maybe he ' s right and it ' s the general audiences who are wrong .	1
nah , just another dog walker in his 4 0 s .	1
i can already see the oscar nominations .	1
psh , i totally could ' ve done better .	1
but it ' s animated , therefore it ' s for kids	1
yeah no one ever is . just ask harrison ford or ewan mcgregor or mark hammil . none of them are known for anything other than star wars .	1
you forgot the fact that he ' s the only one capable of saving us from disaster .	1
i still think [ a short look at luke ' s grizzled face should have been the last shot ]	1
yeah . <repeated> because <allcaps> those </allcaps> are glenn close ' s best known roles	1
oh yeah a vague description if something from a third party is magnitudes better than seeing it in action . that ' s why we pay money to see films in theater rather than read the synopsis on wikipedia .	1
yeah unity was certainly well devolved .	1
well there are 3 pictures actually , so i would say we have enough info to judge the movie .	1
they are projectionists after all .	1
i am so glad this has become a thing . i look forward to seeing it in every star wars thread .	1
i do not see hin fitting doctor strange , but whatever maybe howard duck will be good .	1
yeah , its not like they are movies . they are just episodes and the season finale is avengers .	1
bernie sanders 2016 ! <repeated>	1
because no one ever expected that to happen .	1

i think you dropped this .	1
" anything without " " bullet time " " and <allcaps> cgi </allcaps> is garbage . "	1
yeah , he destroyed his own ai prototypes , totally a villainous thing to do .	1
as leo tipped his fedora into the abyss , he demonstrated male disposability , and chicks love male disposability .	1
you have heard about them ? it ' s good to see underground talent like them getting more press .	1
so they get to go to space <allcaps> and </allcaps> get a free movie ? that ' s bullshit !	1
i thought trading places was just a comedy not a black comedy . i want a refund damn it .	1
<allcaps> but the whole plot is a new hope cmon </allcaps> !	1
remember all those great moments where anakin acts stupid and obi wan acts annoyed ? god , they had such a great friendship !	1
declare war on it . it ' s working great for everything else .	1
because we expected he would not like it	1
according to people who defend piracy , this should significantly increase hate eight ' s box office by word of mouth publicity and whatnot . congratulations to quentin tarantino on this stroke of really , really good luck . 6 0 0 k + downloads !	1
jackie chan is in there 15 times or so . what an uncoordinated loser	1
this movie better be good .	1
<allcaps> the ancient fear </allcaps>	1
yeah . cameron does not have a very good track record with sequels .	1
what about tusk ? surely that was a sign of a comeback , no ? ! <repeated>	1
and they are both relates to mace windu right ?	1
except for a mountain of money .	1
but they had a movie	1
yeah it ' s totally the studios fault if this looked and was ridiculous	1
the people that compile information for that site must be a blast at parties .	1
he would cut every time a space fight or lightsaber duel would start .	1

your post needs more edge , and more spoilers . <repeated>	1
yeah , but are you high ?	1
it ' s weird . people have such differing opinions . i just do not get it .	1
i can not wait to see finn frozen in carbonite in ' first order strikes once more '	1
good thing that had that massive marketing campaign , otherwise no one would have gone .	1
you not listing a single one of them helps your argument a lot	1

holy shit spoilers	1
spoilers bro	1
it came out five years ago , you know what that means , <allcaps> reboot </allcaps> ! <repeated>	1
this wasn ' t expected	1
yeah , the rebels was way better !	1
this is another disney ploy ! advertise star wars spoilers to make you see it faster to increase box office profits !	1
* * no ! make it an all female cast ! * *	1
he was in movies recently ?	1
only the first two are worth loving . <repeated>	1
if you have to watch a dub you are not a real fan	1
we do not consider it a good diwali unless a family member lands in the hospital with at least 2 nd degree burns .	1
yeah , reboots suck . <repeated> fury road was epic though and we can not wait to see the third iteration of spider - man ! <repeated>	1
" i know right ? ! <repeated> it ' s almost like in the original trilogy they actually act like they are holding an extremely delicate weapon and treat it as so , almost like skilled swordsman dueling . so glad that they went more with the " " electro ballet " " style in the prequels where there ' s no stakes or drama at all because you never get the sense that these are two men actually trying to kill each other . "	1
nah , he lives in the eastern hemisphere and it ' s about to be midnight	1
a jew playing a catholic ? nice move hollywood .	1
no man , jessica jones is completely unbelievable as a superhero .	1
oh yeah , star wars is garbage . stupid film industry .	1
another movie about kennedy ? yay	1
did not you get memo about [ at all ] muscular women being too manly and ugly , and no one wants to see that ? slim supermodel - ish looks is only option for female lead .	1
see how wrong he was ? sci - fi was doing great !	1
she is also fat and black so this makes the yelling twice as funny !	1
where are the men ? i want diversity !	1
i know everything about these characters and this story from this picture alone .	1
right , because women in movies being anything other than a skinny sexbomb is just pandering .	1
wtf is this shit . you are supposed to automatically know it ' s going to suck because it ' s a reboot , or has an all women ' s cast . also is not it obvious from this one still how the movie is going to play out . so predictable .	1
lol .	1
* no you see if a person did not like interstellar , that means they are just too stupid to understand it . if you have a different opinion on movies , its because you like transformers garbage like a pleb . you are not a * * * * true <allcaps> film </allcaps> connoisseur * * * * like me . *	1
you mean to tell me this is an actual teaser trailer and does not give the entire plot away ? this is 2015 , wtf ?	1
eh . needs more beastie boys	1
this is the best idea ever .	1
is he the woman in this one too ?	1
why would you do that when you can make money from the same one twice ?	1
no , if you are a stripper you obviously have zero potential .	1
women should learn to keep their mouths shut .	1
well it took the rogers 15 + years to think about it . hopefully they do it in a more clever way .	1
he was upset that his character did not get to personally blow up the mothership and mow down all of the aliens himself and add a custom rap song . [ qt movie the he did not do spoiler ] ( <hashtag> s </hashtag> apparently the reason he passed down on django unchained was because django did not get to kill candy in the script . he thought he should be the one to do that because he was the star )	1
pull the ethernet cable before playing	1
well i think you are a jerk and a poopie - head and i am telling mom .	1
its not made by the same guy from the originals , so honestly it does not really count .	1
you are right , they stole a ton of food because they were literally starving to death and not because they were greedy fucks .	1
wow , so subtle	1
part of me is genuinely surprised jennifer lawrence is not on the poster .	1
wow that ' s some great photoshop !	1
how do you know ? <repeated>	1
i am in just as long as they waste an hour rehashing an original story i have already seen .	1
obviously , both forms of behaviour are equally atrocious .	1
why is obama watching movies when there are <allcaps> terrorists coming after us </allcaps> ! <repeated> <allcaps> worst president ever </allcaps>	1
not if he comes and takes over the country with those black helicopters first	1
ah man , do not you get it ? he ' s just a normal guy like everyone else . even if he is a total fascist but do not focus on the facist part just the cool guy part because that ' s all there is left to like about him .	1
yeah , that ' s why francis ford coppola and michael cimino are in the game .	1
that ' s cause they have not seen the other posters . duh .	1
i am disappointed there ' s no joke about dangerous animals yet myself	1
they are going the blair witch route . you never see godzilla the whole movie . he ' s scarier that way .	1
<allcaps> spoilers dude </allcaps> !	1
because , racist .	1
maybe they decided it wasn ' t worth making a bad movie in exchange for lots of money .	1
sh <elongated> , spoilers .	1
<allcaps> but its fantasy in space </allcaps> , <allcaps> not scifi </allcaps> ! <repeated>	1
no no , it ' s a prequel <emphasis> even though it adds nothing contextually and has the same plot and plot elements of its predecessor .	1
i wish you had given us a trigger warning with that post .	1
and google and reddit ( admins / devs ) and twitter and mozilla and any tech companies located in san fran , portland , toronto , quebec . <repeated> not to mention the majority of colleges . they are absolutely a small group with no power	1
it ' s offensive to me that they got a non male model ( ben stiller ) to play a male model . it downplays the hardships male models have faced in society . i demand a safe space to watch the movie in where they replace all the actors with male models .	1
thank god for reddit . i had not even heard anything about this and i would not have known i was supposed to be outraged if it wasn ' t for this post . now i am definitely triggered and will not see this film .	1
i am sure there ' s a trans ? ( i still do not know what they want ) actor out there that ' s as good as benedict .	1
because the goofy throwaway scene at the end is the whole point of the movie .	1
well we need these safe spaces right ?	1
<allcaps> delicious male tears </allcaps> ! <repeated>	1
it ' s fucked up . they should have gotten a fat guy to play the tom cruise role . why give skinny people roles that are meant for fat people . also tyler perry has some explaining to do while i am at it .	1
finkle / einhorn	1
so , what you are telling me is , agent cody banks was the better movie .	1
director / actor was too inexperienced	1

literately hitler for having a different opinion !	1
everyone is talking about those two huge movies going head to head , but i bet that pusha t short film will destroy both of those .	1
i am shocked	1
* but star trek and into darkness were both good ! *	1

am i the only one who liked the dark knight rises ?	1
oh but let us not forget that the film was already ruined because the script was leaked .	1

this is only getting downvoted , i wonder why ?	1

cool the oscars have a black friend ! having a black friend does not make them racist at all .	1

yeah chekhov was a horrible choice .	1
that is exactly what lurkernation is suggesting . geez . follow the damn law !	1

you mean you do not enjoy seeing sam jackson spending minutes walking forwards a few paces , then backwards , then laying down his guns , then walking forward again , with his hands above his hat ? or kurt russell spending half a minute fumbling for reading glasses ? or people spending minutes struggling to hammer boards onto a door on three separate occasions ?	1

wow did you call a black guy saying racist things racist ? that ' s racist bro , check your privilege .	1
but when will white , jewish males have a shot at winning an oscar ?	1
you are right , matt is such a gay name .	1
i did not see the movie but i could tell he was shit	1
yeah , because that ' s totally relevant .	1
black people are entitled to have black oscar nominees every year , and if they do not , then obviously it ' s racism . the only reason the guy who played ice cube in straight outta compton wasn ' t nominated for an oscar is because of racism .	1
ah yes , bernie , the guy that can not even manage his own finances and has not done anything of note his entire 30 years as a senator . what a great president he will make .	1
concussion , best picture	1
because they needed to crown the first gay oscar winner	1
you think the big banks are bad ? wait until you see what racist , black - hating industry bernie is funded by ! that ' s why he does so poorly with the black voters .	1
yeah , what ' s wrong with these idiots ? they need to learn how to enjoy movies exactly like you do . you are way is the right way to enjoy something , their way is wrong .	1
they look for all the white actors and pick from there ?	1
oh wow ! i am so shocked !	1
sorry , it ' s surely as bad to try to represent minorities at a reasonable ratio as it is to simply ignore the problem and hope it goes away . good point . the best way to fix racism is to stop talking about racism .	1

yea totally ! matthew mcconaughey was a fucking awful actor in dallas buyers club because he did so many romantic comedies before . he just played the same role so many times and now i am suppose to respect him because he took on more serious roles . if you think people can improve on a craft they developed you are just as simple minded as everyone else . true artist are born with it and do not need to be established before their ultimate master piece .	1

i do not understand . i thought all the hype was only on reddit and no one but reddit saw and understood the clever marketing ?	1
do not besmirch star lord like that . he goes to hospitals to cheer up sick kids and is a hollywood actor while you just sit at home and eat cheetos and type on reddit . when have you done anything good for anybody ? never . so , before you criticize one of the guardians of the galaxy , maybe think about what you can do to make a big impact on the world other than your computer chair or when you fall down ( because , unlike star lord , you are not in peek physical shape ) .	1

a 145 year old guitar that existed all the way till now and was smashed in a blockbuster movie ? definitely better . it was just sitting in the museum , unplayed for how many years ? now you have it in multiple pieces for multiple museums to display that now has an oscar winning producer to futher its greatness ? i dont see whats up everyones butts	1
because as we all know , american cartoons should only exist to sell toys .	1
well they can rest easy knowing that its destruction was properly immortalized on 7 0 mm ultra panavision in one long glorious take .	1
yeah , it was such a snub when * godfather pt . ii * won best picture .	1
concussion did not male the list ? wow , that ' s racist !	1

thought his acting debut was in the last season of game of thrones	1
perfect . people love <allcaps> agw </allcaps> films .	1
oh yes , because david deutsch said it , that means it must be a fact , therefore all hostile alien movie premises are invalid . i assume he has proved <emphasis> this ?	1

looking at the upvotes you got , i can tell that reddit is full of devil worshipers	1
silly simpleton , it ' s only racist when white people do it	1
there ' s only one indian in hollywood . i know this because i have never seen two star in a television show at the same time and casting would never overlook something like this .	1
who ? was she in star wars <allcaps> vii </allcaps> ?	1
b - but theyre gonna use her in the next movie ! this was just her introduction so stop hating !	1
i could really watch any movie . dude definitely brings nothing original to the game .	1
of course they would bring back one of the most important characters .	1
" darn no more noomi rapace close - ups to add to my " " o - face " " folder "	1
bvs is absolute garbage . it ' s one of the worst films ever created . i literally got eye - cancer watching that shallow film and zack snyder should be properly punished for making such an abomination . i predict $70m opening weekend and $400m ww . biggest flop of the century .	1
how about lindelof gives the script a quick ' once - over ' then ?	1
i hope they spoil the whole movie with the next trailer !	1
yeah , bro . i wish we could always watch movies where kids use racial slurs for humor . stupid <allcaps> sjw </allcaps> cucks .	1
yep . one drop and you are evil .	1
i liked the part where the dude got shot	1
it ' s okay . if you know the books you ' d know his nonconsensual forcing of pussy galore in goldfinger was necessary because she was a lesbian . fortunately , bond was able to fix that with that with a quick tussle in a barn .	1
i give until noon on the day of release . anyone who * really <elongated> * wanted to see it would catch a midnight showing . i should not ever have to be considerate of other people when i want to talk .	1
so does this mean that marvel could <allcaps> finally </allcaps> get the rights back to batman and superman ? ! <repeated>	1
snider directs movies , he does not make the score	1
but it ' s practical effects and not that <allcaps> cgi </allcaps> garbage every film today is spewing out so it actually looks amazing	1
superman just punched a man through multiple buildings and proceeded to punch him back to the ground and level that road . so what ' s the difference ?	1
well that ' s because you are a woman	1
onions	1
but they trained in a simulator for like , a whole day !	1
there are cable lines on that telephone pole . did this movie even try to recreate the time period ?	1
yes , why are people hating on one of the similar groups , but like the other ? that totally does not happen in real life at all !	1
<allcaps> shut up marvel fanboy </allcaps> ! <repeated>	1
did you know han solo had a cameo in indiana jones ? <surprise>	1
i am really sick of how the fact he ' s the villian for almost every batman film and show . like give the joker a chance	1
funny ? huh , a zack snyder movie that is not funny . <repeated> weird !	1
ah do people forget that spacejam exists .	1
what , did not you like jackson - with - a - lisp as a supervillain ?	1
you were given two options : mild disapproval wasn ' t one of them .	1
oh , i guess that invalidates my entire argument !	1
what about those critics that spent countless hours destroying the film , does their work mean nothing	1
woah ! spoilers dude !	1
i am not a huge basketball fan , but i think coach carter nailed the story it was trying to tell and it really made me interested in basketball . either that or high school musical	1

no deathsticks in ep <allcaps> vi <elongated> </allcaps> ? way to ruin a franchise	1
watching a hollywood movie about mcdonalds is on the top of my to do list in life .	1
no , unless you are in the news all the time , you are obviously a failure and not doing anything with your life	1
fuck you for enjoying the movie !	1
yea fuck you and your opinion	1
duh , because superman is an illegal taking our jobs .	1
i am shocked that rolling stone would put bob dylan number one of their list .	1
i cant believe people think this will bomb , i mean its ben affleck .	1
no you are wrong , they are all paid marvel shills	1
it ' s not murder if they still have a pulse when he leaves !	1
you can not tell me that god ' s not dead 2 does not look like an oscar worthy film !	1
needs more <allcaps> hgh </allcaps> and testosterone right from an alpha bull ' s testicles . i wanna see zits on the back and a vote change from gal godat .	1
no just a movie featuring women warriors . i bet they will even sucessfully fight bad guys who are men in this move . more vile feminazi propaganda !	1
oh how racist clearly these women are not greek	1
do not you know women are small , dainty , fragile things ?	1
jenny cleaned up her act . good for her .	1
yeah what an irrational thought process following the massive failure of the gritty , humorless nolan batman trilogy .	1
like the movie , its not fun	1
themyscira has been gentrified . only skinny , white affluent women are all that is left of the amazons .	1
i mean we do have standards . we are not animals .	1
bro have you seen the legends of the guardians : the owls of ga ' hoole ? ! <repeated>	1
it ' s clearly revenge of the sith	1
that ' s how you have batman . he does not work during the day so it has to be night .	1
they do not have to because hitler is self - funding .	1
cuz they gays are destroying murica	1
yeah and as we know , they only serve the catholic homeless	1
youtube comments say otherwise ! <repeated>	1
honestly catwoman was a masterpiece	1
no , the other facebook .	1
he can not handle the dark and grittiness of the film !	1
hahahaha guise this guy is feeling crappy because he ' s being discriminated against ! hahaha what a pussy he should man up	1
we should totally not do something out of fear , the terrorists would hate that .	1
everything the reviews found wrong with it	1
she was in thor ?	1
no , obviously jimmy is the funniest person to ever be on his show . it ' s his show , he is the star , and he is the funniest .	1
did you know that movie took * 12 years * to make ?	1
you mean only white people can be racist , right ?	1
but why should we be recording movies in * * * <allcaps> their </allcaps> * * * language ? they should be learning to speak american , goddammit	1
she ' s a brunette . she ' s english . she was in <allcaps> star wars </allcaps> . i can not possibly think of any other factors to consider when casting a character for a huge reboot .	1
i can confidently say , on behalf of all star wars fans that the cg in attack of the clones is far better than those goofy practical effects from the 80 ' s films .	1
yeah she has really shown her chops on grey ' s anatomy .	1
oh my . how debilitating .	1
yeah , i long for the day when all people speak only english . why have diversity at all ?	1
nope .	1
yeah , why ruin the classics that are the original tomb raider movies !	1
yeah , how dare the navajo nation museum choose to translate it into navajo rather than swahili !	1
i hope it ' s as good as anchorman 2 .	1
this really added to the discussion .	1
i hope it ' s as good a anchorman 2 !	1
farcry	1
wait , that wasn ' t what the movie was about ? ! <repeated>	1
because i have an opinion that differs from all the cool kids on reddit ? you are not judgemental at all .	1
yep . this shit is the norm . most men you deal with will be this way .	1
if that ' s not real then someone sure took a long time thinking it all up for nothing . anyway , i will probably still watch the movie .	1
there was a trailer they put out back in november . i have not even seen this tv spot yet but i am sure it ' s glorious .	1
it ' s reddit , agree with us or fuck you !	1
next up , should anyone under 17 be banned from a movie theater ?	1
smart move , everyone loved that last one so much	1
no , it ' s a hp and hunger games ripoff and it sucks !	1
meaning you live in a stump ?	1
she did not want reddit to see her tits so she ' s a stuck up bitch .	1
yay , wonder womans first onscreen appearance and we reduce her to being a naked sexthing !	1
personally , i ' d prefer my sandman without wonky musical numbers and plot - lines that go no where .	1
holy shit the <allcaps> cgi </allcaps> got so much better . it ' s almost like the first trailer was incomplete <allcaps> cgi </allcaps>	1
just let him use the accent that he used in the revenant	1
you read all of snape ' s book ?	1
yeah , why did not they answer those questions in the trailer ?	1
oh no this guy has an opinion that differs from the crowd , let us all downvote him	1
but it ' s a comic book movie so it has to be ok for kids , right ?	1
nope , it can not be the fact she was awesome in silver linings playbook and they are totally fucking up the mystique character with how much they are pushing jlaw , it ' s just because reddit is a bunch of mindless conformists .	1
less chance of them screwing up lines !	1
that ' s classic victim blaming .	1
ugh , i hated john boyega before it was even cool . he ' s so annoyingly fake and relatable . what a douchebag .	1
but its jennifer lawrence !	1
yeah , because x - men 1 , x - men 2 and x - men : days of future past were such bad films that everyone hates	1
whose the girl on the bottom left ?	1
now remember , this was before 9 / 11 . people with bombs were allowed to go anywhere they wanted .	1
what character is jlaw playing ?	1
so the top , most profitable and highest earning directors are for it , and the ones that only have a few successful films under their belt are against it ? sounds legit . i was wondering when the geriatrics were going to come out against the proposed natural progression of the industry that might put them out of a job .	1
but racism is prejudice + power and asians are successful so you can not be racist against them .	1
but i thought executives were just overpaid crooks and their work did not matter . anybody could do just as good as a job .	1
it ' s only an issue when the person being disrespected is a woman .	1
yes , because crystal skull was * beloved <emphasis> * by its fans	1

a silly and ridiculous scene in an indiana jones film ? <allcaps> no fucking way </allcaps> !	1

<allcaps> spoilers </allcaps> !	1
when opinions goes as valid criticism	1
ratatouille 2 just rolls off the tongue !	1

i dunt c a prolbem ?	1
what ? you did not like the cinematic masterpiece that was the sum of all fears ?	1
christopher nolan , such a hack !	1
that ' s because people do not use <allcaps> usd </allcaps> in the uk silly	1
jeez , he meant 1950 ' s , not 1550 ' s .	1
why would we need to know the point at which a movie makes or loses money ?	1
shut up nerd .	1
right , because if disney does anything , it sucks the life out of movies and makes only unwatchable garbage .	1
and , as we all know , spies can not be bald .	1
no dude , <allcaps> this </allcaps> one was <allcaps> evil </allcaps> and the movie was <allcaps> only </allcaps> made as a <allcaps> fuck you </allcaps> to dudes on the internet !	1
they should make it even better by giving the fans what they want , and make beetle juice a female this time ! i vote for melissa mccarthy !	1
<allcaps> we want more sequels </allcaps> ! <allcaps> we want more sequels </allcaps> ! <allcaps> we want more sequels </allcaps> !	1
wait there was a third alien movie ?	1
ahem , his last name is spelled without the d . get with the program .	1
oh yeah it totally makes sense . tony stark talking about how super heroes should be policed then goes and uses a child as a foot soldier in a war . makes lots of sense .	1
wow dude . that was useful .	1

get paul w.s. and he can cast milla as 20 year old lara	1
that does not guarantee the movie will be crap at all !	1
so . <repeated> it ' s a comic book ?	1
the requested page could not be found ? one of the best ! <repeated>	1
thanks tim burton for making my biggest dream a reality	1

the best month for movies	1
i do not remember that one . <repeated> but i remember his cameo in the first hobbit movie . i do not think he ' s been in anything much besides that though .	1
just $140 ? no millions ?	1
proving the age - old adage , if you are loud enough people will eventually listen to you .	1
should have been nominated for i , frankenstein	1
but you can not criticise her , that would be sexist . you can only criticise men	1
i have been saying it for years ! if they are gonna make a surf ' s up sequel , * it has to be about the <allcaps> wwe </allcaps> * ! it ' s the only logical progression	1
they are all commies anyway , what does it matter	1
no , they did it because they are racist pigs . and guess what , mj did not even win an oscar for his performance , <hashtag> looney toons so white </hashtag>	1
because he killed zod !	1
of course it ' s fast it ' s about cars	1
they are missing out on a huge opportunity . utilizing stereotypes helps avoid a lot of awkward exposition . need a thug , but do not want to spend time establishing that he ' s a thug ? make him black . need a really bad driver ? asian woman . brilliant doctor ? indian . evil mastermind ? british guy in a black turtleneck . where would cinema be today if it were not for these timeless archetypes ?	1
" " " it ' s a cadillac ! " " i laughed so hard i sharted "	1
i thought it was they simply hate women and also hate seeing women in film , like in aliens and terminator films	1
it would have made more rated r probably . deadpool made 135 m after all .	1
no surprise since all artistic people use drugs	1
" <allcaps> what </allcaps> ? ! <repeated> you mean you did not like the " " power of patty compels you " " scene ? ! <repeated> "	1
oh wow , an artist took acid in the ' 7 0 s . what a crazy fact .	1
" michelle did not say " " how rude " " , stephanie did , you filthy pleb . learn your stuff . "	1
yeah . but they have all been pirated which is why the movies never break any records	1
only once though . we can not have people waking to reality or anything . we have got a lot of money invested in this .	1
you cannot do this . society needs you to be an obedient worker bee .	1
not everyone can have such an elegant and refined taste such as yours	1
shut up , interstellar is perfect	1
i did not know edward olmos was playing jacob duran	1
only a stupid woman would think that .	1
just what we need . <repeated> more superhero / villain movies . yay !	1
yes , because one of the most popular pc games are only for mouth breathing idiots , just like comics and star wars .	1
no , but today the specific gender of the lead character means no one of any other gender is supposed to enjoy it	1
that ' ll happen when you graduate from west point .	1
it ' s probably because it does not star ice - t .	1
oh great , another superheroes movie . whoopie ! <repeated>	1
they should have done what the new power rangers did : have 1 asian , 1 mexican , 1 black and 2 white people . then maybe people would not complain as much .	1
it should be r rated too	1
i really think the black woman could have been played by a white girl . <repeated> <hashtag> whitewashing matters </hashtag>	1
ya well were talking movies not books .	1
racist	1
not with isis at large . know the enemy	1
yeah but they are women so it ' s gonna suck obvs	1
the third live action teenage mutant ninja turtles .	1
true ! i am excited to see how the movie shows her storyarc gaining knowledge of the metro subway ( new york city ) , history of cadillac love ( chicago ) , but also sounds like a stereotypical southern baptist ( bible belt )	1
remember , its because we hate women that we dont like it , not because it sucks .	1
he had first - hand training in practical application of paranormal sciences , but clearly he ' s not a scientist because he does not have a degree	1
" because chris farley coined and owns the phrase " " that ' s gonna leave a mark " " "	1

why so negative ? this is going to be at least as good as aeon flux !	1
obviously	1
<allcaps> we did it </allcaps> , <allcaps> reddit </allcaps> !	1
" gotta love " " global free trade " " . we teach them rudimentary english and then pay half what a <allcaps> sag </allcaps> actor would get . "	1
ah well , they can just buy another guitar right ?	1
oh yeah because they definitely put this through production since the <hashtag> oscarsowhite </hashtag> stuff	1
but cgi is the devil movies should go back to only using physical effects because no good movie ever uses cgi	1
duh , every story has to have a beginning , a middle , and an end ! that ' s just basic money grabbing .	1
ah yes , because she failed so miserably at her last series	1
racist !	1
i gotta agree , the revenant would have been so much better if they had just stuck to the source material and not include leo ' s son . instead the film should have been about his quest to retrieve his rifle from tom hardy ' s character .	1
you want a sequel to magnolia ?	1
but 1994 was the best year in the history of film ! <repeated>	1
also let us make eddie an asian computer geek instead of a drug addict while we are at it . and he will struggle without internet instead of drugs . because why not ?	1
oh fuck yeah ! why have a movie set in mid - world when we can have another movie set in our location !	1
" yeah , " " sucked ass " " is pretty thorough "	1
nothing like the high quality masterpiece sequels that american cinema produces .	1
yeah , and when will anime quit casting blondes , redheads , and , like blue haired white girls as japanese schoolchildren ? ! <repeated>	1
do not you know ? black people can not be racist	1
oh it definitely is , i was actually attempting to be snarky . sure will be great when we can have fonts that convey tone of voice or meaning in their style . ya i know about	1
it helps if you use this . <repeated>	1
pfft . i am sure george miller is disappointed that mad max has to be in the same company as those films .	1
first they take our jobs , now they take our awards .	1
exactly it ' s racism that straight out of compton did not consider any chinese actors for their main roles . yeah that ' s racism by your standard .	1
i would have liked all the president ' s men without the text .	1
right , you are just walking out into a world that is 71% covered by oceans of fatally corrosive liquid which also literally falls out of the sky on a regular basis . it ' s not instant death though , so it ' s totally reasonable to just go naked .	1
lol , how could he play a black guy ? <repeated>	1
sexism . <allcaps> all </allcaps> sexism . 100% of it .	1
no way . it ' s definitely because of misogyny	1
oh , man : a vagina joke ten seconds in and <emphasis> a racially driven attache character ? they have <emphasis> thought of everything .	1
but . <repeated> what if it ' s a masterpiece of modern cinema , like blues brothers 2000 was ? ! <repeated>	1
dont you know ? the patriarchy cant handle strong independent women !	1
is that logan marshall - green ?	1
sick of cops ; when will hollywood make tv shows again ?	1
thats just clearly because you have internalised misogyny . stop spreading hate speech	1
you are just upset about the female empowerment	1
if i had it my way we ' d go back to the times of shakespeare and all roles would be played by men .	1
yep , it ' s clear tackling someone who is about to murder a child is planned murder	1
i do not get it , why are you showing me the powerpuff girls ? they are girls , get your fact straight !	1
they should have casted dwyane johnson . is not that what they are doing with reboots these days ?	1
yeah what ' s going on is brave internet warriors are stopping the feminist agenda	1
i just hope it ' s an origin story . i have been dying to see how spidey came to be on the big screen !	1
another spiderman movie ! yay , hopefully we will finally find out about his origin .	1
dude , no . they had last - minute reshoots 6 months before the movie comes out . no movie has ever done that before .	1
yeah that worked well for wonderwoman did not it ?	1
but her tits are not big enough . <repeated>	1
maybe he is playing cassandra nova .	1
how comcast wants to buy dreamworks for $3b , thanks a lot , op .	1
aww c ' mon a 2 hour commercial with transformers getting sued for not being enough of a commercial is not ironic	1
i bet this is 100% accurate .	1
yeah , why would he try to emulate a voice of the person he is acting to be ?	1
do not worry they will fix it in post	1
you are wrong , they know , they saw it on tv and on the internet , must be true !	1
it ' s like people can change their minds over time , or they might not have liked her in dofp , or she could have made other films since dofp that sucked . safe to say the hatred for her started after dofp and those were fairly big factors .	1
just another example of the unrealistic body standards women are held to and men totally are not .	1
that ' s because they are objects . we are not talking about the beach or the sky either .	1
on a planet full of male only prisoners ? unbelievable	1
you mean wow : mists of pandaria ? it wasn ' t that great .	1
it ' s definitely a fact when it ' s about likes and dislikes . that ' s just how stuff works .	1
reboot ? there is not a reboot .	1
wonder if mystique will be in this ? looks like they just replaced her with jlaw	1
a $25,000 fine for the potential corruption of innocent minds ? that ' s an abomination !	1
indeed , he was superb as genghis khan in the conquerors .	1
yeah because marvel / disney has proven that you just can not translate your characters and stories onto the screen and expect to make money .	1
hahaha good one .	1
how does this have anything to do with the show itself ? oh no ! <allcaps> cbs </allcaps> needs me to subscribe ! i guess i will never watch it as there ' s possibly no other alternative .	1
people are entitled to those nudes because she ' s a celebrity and celebrities belong to us body and soul	1

the ones agreeing with me .	1
nonono . it ' s where those sjws limit our free speech by getting all triggered and offended .	1
translation : chinese official advocates continued us access to this market because it may advance their space program , and most certainly has nothing to do with how financially invested he is in it , nor is it an invitation to us filmmakers .	1
the social commentary was very immediate	1
the marketing really undersold it .	1
but them cheap chinese workers stealing american jobs at <allcaps> nasa </allcaps> and shit .	1
well , refusing to cooperate on peaceful scientific missions is sure to help .	1
warner bros . sure know how to keep a pulse on what the people want .	1
that was directed by bowie ' s kid , right ?	1
i actually have seen it . <repeated> but am i the <allcaps> only </allcaps> one who did not really like it ?	1
well not nowadays , but that ' s because generations today are pussies and commies .	1
this is as surprising as star wars breaking records .	1
but then he ' d be downvoted for having a positive opinion on transformers movie	1
without your totally necessary comment i would not have known what he meant .	1
or you could try reading it like rudyard kipling intended !	1
gee , hollywood , why do not you remake goonies . and monster squad . might as well take the breakfast club , and war games , too . how about a live action kidd video ? or space camp , yeah , that really needs a remake . might as well redo the last starfighter while you are at it . here , have my whole childhood , i wasn ' t using it anymore anyway .	1
wow you have a different opinion then me and that makes you stupid .	1
anime is all the same right ?	1
there ' s a film screaming for a remake	1
what ? the bourne ultimatum is <emphasis> a real movie though !	1
i can not watch at 60 fps does any one have a real life trailer that runs at 24 fps ?	1
vin diesel is currently their top prospect	1
yeah and that slide - whistle sound effect was just great .	1
so brave	1
schwarzenegger , the man is a chameleon and truely transforms into whatever character he plays . i never recognize him when watching a movie .	1
godzilla is not asian	1
he meant an important oscar	1
you wash your mouth out !	1
you know who ' s death would suck ? ted cruz .	1
dark and gritty versions , oh why how <allcaps> surprising </allcaps> of warner bros to do that	1

where is batman or antman ? where are the superheroes ? <repeated>	1
uh , that ' s four movies .	1
shut your mouth you fat , uncultured , loud , juvenile , hamburger loving , cheap beer chugging american swine .	1
live action <allcaps> cgi </allcaps> lions	1
i think chris pratt might be in this movie	1
nice guy that hitler . knows how to treat his fans	1
wonder how much disney paid robbie for this review .	1
seems like hollywood is on this remake reboot binge . pwr rangers 1 st couple seasons were great as a kid . please leave it at that . even the movies thereafter were meh . so 20 years later , oh man , u know its gonna be hit	1
yeah , denzel ' s a shit actor . they only hired him because he ' s black	1
what ? ! <repeated> another white woman playing a asian role ? <allcaps> wtf </allcaps> hollywood ?	1
why , the martian was comedy gold , i was in stitches the entire time .	1
wow , they really pay respect to the original costume .	1
nanny state for the win !	1
more hollywood whitewashing !	1
more hollywood whitewashing !	1
hopefully people do not run out of things that hurt their feels .	1
no <elongated> but alcohol is evil think of the children ! <repeated>	1
yeah titanic 2 : titanic harder was a kick ass movie .	1
yeah , one would have to be complete idiot to even think about making sequel for highest grossing movie of all - time . i mean redditor ' s are not even quoting and making dank memes about it , so it clearly has no cultural relevancy	1
sh <elongated> . <repeated> everyone here could run a studio better than kennedy . do not you hear all these incredible ideas ?	1
the first one is her real face , right ?	1
but if she was japanese then how come she do not have them squinty eyes ?	1
perfectly fine to have a black james bond or superman , though !	1
hey man , he needed to cram all religious symbolism instead of character developing , its pretty obvious whats needed first right	1
ben mckenzie could .	1
and the first order blew up a whole solar system in the force awakens , so batman and superman can kill whoever they want	1
yes . superman is a murderous killing robot . snyder perfectly encapsulated that beloved part of his character .	1
but the third star trek is not out until july	1
yeah , so it was just like tron !	1
yea i agree there ' s not enough westerns based on revenge	1
one should only watch lawrence of arabia in 7 0 mm .	1
do not watch se7en , either . you will be disappointed .	1
can confirm . kindergarten cop was so manly .	1
well , except for those critics who were paid off by disney	1
cool shots put to inception ' s ' time ' . i never thought i ' d see the day .	1
no no no , you see . <repeated> snyder is a hack who does not know how to direct movies .	1
while clearly the only viable option being lucy liu	1
will it have a script ? that would be awesome .	1
do not be racist , anon	1
there was a tv series ? why did not anyone tell me ?	1
you can not be negative till the critics or internet personalities give it a negative .	1
of course they were not , we saw no midi - chlorians on screen !	1
youtube unfair ? what <elongated> ? that ' s crazy . <repeated>	1
why not get a mixed raced actor , half - white / half - asain .	1
yes , segregation was the bomb .	1
right , because there are no popular stories about the production of star wars .	1
lol expanding thier knowledge base . <repeated> <allcaps> yeah </allcaps> that ' s what they are doing .	1
it certainly worked well for * the last airbender * and * dragonball evolution * .	1
what a tattle tale	1
it is fucking dumb , i am 21 and i have started carrying a . 22 hunting rifle with me into films so i can just shoot their phones out of their hands .	1
<allcaps> amc </allcaps> should make an app that lets you text the theatre directly alerting them of the texter in front or behind you	1
uh huh . cussing is so cool . especially when it ' s offensive . it really added to the story .	1
what ? was emma stone not available ?	1
damn . get them started early .	1
well , men can not actually be raped	1
well they are weaker so its more important . the strong should not pick on the weak .	1
is that the smart girl from modern family ?	1
i know , right , lucy liu isnt even a real asian	1
it ' s good to see you have your priorities in line .	1
he ' s european . stop making fun of his accent !	1
oh , no . fox is not fucking over a well working idea / team . how boring , indeed .	1
thank you for reminding us that only white people exists in the movies . i think actual japanese people is like a myth right ? as long as there ' s white leads in all my entertainment , my world is safe and sound . excuse me as i re - watch <allcaps> gist </allcaps> knowing the major is actually one of the whitest woman on earth .	1
what ' s going on with all this dialogue ? refn what the heck man .	1
you do not imagine motoko kusanagi as a super super super white woman ? i just can not see why .	1
cmon now everyone loved the saiyaman saga !	1
yeah that sounds really hard to translate to an american situation .	1
<allcaps> amc </allcaps> corporate : well , americans have grown up with their second amendment rights , so we are exploring allowing patrons to bring their firearms with them to the theater , to integrate their right to bear arms into their right to enjoy the amenities of an <allcaps> amc </allcaps> theater experience .	1
" " " considering " " - my local <allcaps> amc </allcaps> already does this ! not only that , but you can play on your phone the entire movie and no employee will ever care ! mine must be so progressive compared to other <allcaps> amc </allcaps> theaters ! "	1
everyone knows women belong in the kitchen , not movies	1
just admit it , you ' d rather have stage 4 cancer of the brain than put your phone down for 2 minutes ! you millennials are all the same .	1
mass murders will not scar a child . breasts though ? that poor child will be mentally scarred forever .	1
yeah havent you played every game in existance	1
disney made sure those checks were mailed early .	1
^ found the jay sympathizer .	1
hob goblin confirmed	1
hydra mad scientist experimenting with cosmic - rays and alien <allcaps> dna </allcaps> of course !	1
i hope we get another origin story ! it ' s been almost 4 years since the last one !	1
they should recast bill and ted as women to make it more 2016 , i think kirsten wiig and melissa mccarthy would be the best casting choices	1
" na , fuck them for creating their universe first and having it be hugely successful , it ' s totally not everyone else spamming the " " universe " " idea for fucking everything . "	1
so he was still a protagonist ?	1
yeah , why can not they be more intellectual , like wrath of khan or first contact ? do not forget that the most action - packed star trek film , the motion picture , bombed completely ! why can not they learn from past mistakes ?	1
this is taking place in <allcaps> mcu </allcaps> , clearly .	1
and totally passable as an asian	1
can not wait to hear all the bitching about white washing movies	1
no , that ' s donald glover .	1
psh , cumberbatch looks nothing like dr . hugo strange , and this looks nothing like arkham asylum .	1
yay ! batman using even more guns and killing even more people while fighting like a drunk boxer !	1
who would have thought an american produced movie would have an american style date ? <repeated>	1
a perfect start to the hype	1
what crystal skull story ?	1
yeah his character in titanic and wolf on wall street was basically the same character as arnie in gilbert grape . dude has no range .	1
yeah dude . he was the shit in talahaga nights	1
yeah , terrible . a new york lawyer who is also a super hero wanting to defend captain america . how awful .	1
oh boy , once snyder releases his amazing adaptation of the fountainhead you will be eating those words ! <repeated>	1
yup , definitely only those 2 and only in those specific and well defined boxes that never in any way mix .	1
he will ! did not you read the title ?	1
oh good , the reason i subscribe to r / movies . politics .	1
huh . <repeated> you are right i have never seen an adult at any sic - fi or superhero movie ever	1
i know right ? they should have kept up the daredevil mockery that they began with	1
i think we have an early best picture contender ! take notice , academy !	1
nah whenever i think star wars theme i think of ' jedi rocks ' .	1
criticisms of melissa mccarthy in relation to her being ~ ~ fat ~ ~ a primarily physical comedian are not rooted in internet misogyny at all <elongated>	1
<allcaps> omg </allcaps> there ' s going to be explosions in alien : covenant i am shocked ! shocked i say !	1
as opposed to harley ' s traditionally non - american accent ?	1
it ' s dc so it will suck	1
is this guy trying to tell me that archetypes are a thing ? how revolutionary of an idea .	1
<annoyed> man could it be there were more male characters ? wow man who wrote this garbage	1
but i thought they literally killed all those animals ? ! <repeated>	1
agreed . sjws and feminists should have complete authority on the casting and writing decisions made in hollywood to ensure no minority is taken advantage of by the patriarchy .	1
yes . $2 is going to break the bank	1
^ the ^ ^ good ^^ ^ old ^^^ ^ days	1
gosh ! tell me , who should i hate ? men ? misogynist screen writers ? the film industry ? you must tell me ! i need someone to blame !	1
oh cool . created by polygon . this totally is not going to be biased in any way possible !	1
yeah because if 800 + million for both superhero films that came out this year proves anything , it ' s that people do not want to pay to see super hero movies	1
sounds like apple to me .	1
maybe that ' s how the lativan accent sounds like to russians	1
fast and furious : feminist takeover .	1
" what is edge of tomorrow ? do not you mean " " * live , die , repeat ! * " " ? "	1
i hope the reshoots are to make the film darker .	1
yeah there ' s no room for nuance is there	1
yeah but apparently some people get offended when people dont like it when you jerk off to their nudes . the nerve of some people	1
do not know why a kyle katarn movie is necessary . just watch those cutscenes . they are high art .	1
i do not know , eggsy ' s baby sis did not seem very ruthless !	1
gotta hide those outtakes from the fake moon landing	1
you sexist pig !	1
yes , <allcaps> every </allcaps> single movie coming out has a female lead . no male leads to be seen anywhere in cinema at the moment	1
rupert pupkin was in banshee on tv ?	1
yeah , that ' s why deadpool flopped .	1
should i be concerned that my daughter ' s favorite character is absolutely darth vader ? i mean , i should probably insist she relate to princess leia , right ? <repeated>	1
we need a governing body to protect innocent viewers from spoilerific trailers	1
<allcaps> dae </allcaps> think rey was too perfect at everything ? i mean c ' mon luke was just a farmer with no military , weapons , or combat experience who successfully penetrated the empire ' s largest military base , fought dozens of well trained stormtroopers , entered a detention block that contained a high level prisoner , break them out , escape the death star , pilot a vehicle he ' s never flown during an assault on said death star and survive air combat with well trained fighter pilots despite being horribly outnumbered , survive all the anti - air turrets and defensive mechanisms of this moon sized military base , and then blow it up .	1
i do not know what you are talking about . there is no episode 3 .	1
how else are people watching the movie supposed to be able to tell it ' s her ? ! <repeated>	1
thanks . that info really helps .	1
<allcaps> damn it </allcaps> ! ruined !	1
just wait till you hear the voice the cast for vader ! <wink>	1
maybe it will be as good as the remade battlefront	1
ip man 4 looks great	1
yes , the original movies were certainly a great example of impressive dialog .	1
needs more beastie boys .	1
not forced at all either	1
oh great , another star wars movie with a giant death star .	1
nono , you do not get it . from this one , you are not able to tell the entire plot .	1
right . if <allcaps> esb </allcaps> was your left buttocks cheek and <allcaps> anh </allcaps> the right one .	1
well this was a brave and controversial comment	1
maybe we will get a new christmas special !	1
dude no one cares about king arthur it ' s all about khaleesi now	1
they could update it to parallel the current star trek films . the younger cast could get captured and the old folks have to save them ! it ' d be great	1
right ? fucking sheep .	1
yeah guys a movie is not supposed to be satisfying anymore , now we need 10 sequels and 12 spin offs to do that	1
all that hard work paid off i guess	1
uh , the godless commies ?	1
stop motion clay models look so much more realistic though !	1
a 100 times 0 is still 0 .	1
oh well <allcaps> that </allcaps> bodes well .	1
i blame hollywood whitewashing .	1
cultural appropriation	1
are you saying you did not like seeing james mcavoy ' s face in patrick stewart ' s crotch ?	1
" ah , i see you have encountered the batfan before . it isnt moody and angsty though , its dark , gritty and " " edgy " " . which as you well should know are bywords for quality , relatable storytelling . "	1
i actually thought about committing suicide right there in the theater when i saw it .	1
first ghostbusters now leatherface	1
it sold so well because of the stellar writing and artwork . it wasn ' t a publicity stunt at all .	1
you left a little of the original piece in there , and you missed the <allcaps> ufo </allcaps> ' s up top . plus , i thought shilling off of other people ' s hard work for attention was the american way . is not it ?	1
nah , nah . we need safe spaces .	1
well , that ' s some nickelodeon stuff right there . probably nick jr .	1
yep only communists unite behind nationalist political parties !	1
that ' s actually his totem . only he knows it ' s a double sided coin . so when the coin changes , that ' s when you know he ' s actually in someone else ' s dream .	1
noah	1
yeah that scene where aquaman awkwardly floated there then sped of was amazing !	1
antman and man of steel were <allcaps> literally </allcaps> the same movie	1
ugh white people appropriating magician culture .	1
yes , because they are so <elongated> underrated .	1
because sometimes certain dresses cant be pulled off by certain women and all your left with that day is a long t shirt . you shouldnt tease people for their outfits	1
typical reddit cultural appropriation	1
because you need to be a social delinquent to have a healthy sexual appetite	1
we did it , reddit !	1
yeah , leaving las vegas , adaptation , and joe were all terrible .	1
yeah , its such an uncommon and rare opinion	1
dude have not you read all the articles ? you <allcaps> must </allcaps> think the movie is unwatchable trash if you have any self respect	1
you heinous prick .	1
you must still be in denial !	1
is he the one from hunger games ?	1
because <allcaps> tdk </allcaps> films were so aweful	1
apart from the dozens of posts a week , am i the only one who had an irrational hate for fury road ?	1
how dare <emphasis> she .	1
this is from the mastermind the dark knight rises ! <repeated>	1
what you mean ? you trying to say that is actually not her ?	1
it ' s not bad you are just sexist	1
they are going for that new r rating trend .	1
gilded !	1
time to panic ! they are doing reshoots ! movie is doomed !	1
im sure the executive producer of the new version who also owns a large portion of the franchise has no ulterior motive whatsoever for these remarks .	1
you mean a half black - half samoan guy is going to play a white guy , oh the madness people will be going over this race bending .	1
" yep your completely right , it ' s a terrible <allcaps> fantasy </allcaps> movie that and i quote has " " excessive amounts of <allcaps> fantasy </allcaps> jibber - jabber mostly renders the film nonsensical to everyone else . " " - rotten tomato " " critic " " "	1
because making money is always <emphasis> directly related to how good a movie is .	1
you gotta trust the voice of yogi bear on knowing comedy gold .	1
great , my least favorite part of a movie i did not enjoy will be back !	1
apparently there was aliens in it as well	1
how dare you undermine the strong female lead with male preference . sexist !	1
but jennifer lawrence gets to be the star ! makes perfect sense !	1
but dude it ' s supposed to be way too over the top , cliched , and terrible . the bad jokes are what makes it funny xdd	1
did not it ?	1
i guess that does not include me then ! <happy>	1
because obviously quantico and fucking the goldbergs are what ' s interesting now .	1
i arrived just too late for this . fuck you .	1
racial equality ugh . what a horrible agenda to push !	1
grey - blue and grey - orange are colors .	1
produced by bp , cause how else are they make back their losses on the accident ?	1
but everyone told me bvs was a huge failure .	1
this is not fair ! we need revenue equality in movies ! no movie needs to make that much money when so many others are struggling !	1
why did not that guy duck at the end ?	1
because they hate you <emphasis> personally , and are doing it on purpose to turn you against hollywood .	1
yeah man , real heroes kill their own people for fun !	1
yeah , but eu is not canon now .	1
he does not actually look at the camera . he just looks to his left ( if we start counting walls camera left ) .	1
yeah but they were old , and like , totally not hot .	1
has not the propaganda already worked on you ?	1
if you do not applaud this movie , then you just hate strong women .	1
based on the casting from the dark tower movie , it ' s got to be idris elba , right ?	1
i mean , fuck critics , right ?	1
" but she ' s asian ! i am not watching this movie with one of " " those " " people in it "	1
to be fair , liam neeson is struggling for film roles	1
i just rewatched prim , thought it was amazing . got swept up in the extravaganza and also because i might have crushed on her a bit . i can imagine an alternate script with her character as the lead , that wouldve been compelling . but there ' s a chance that in that version , they cast scarjo instead	1
because those features are exclusive to caucasians	1
stop using examples you oppressive shitlord !	1
she is not blond , so not conventionally attractive .	1
what are you talking about ? ! <repeated> <allcaps> this film is a masterpiece </allcaps> .	1
did not you know that only white men can be racist ?	1
found bill gates account .	1
well there ' s no other possible reason you could dislike this movie , right ?	1
nice photoshopping . it ' s so innovative of them to simply cut away a piece of the structure .	1
i really think this will ruin an already good thing . brotherhood is probably one of my favorite animes , and it really does not need a remake . better include an all female cast so certain groups defend it no matter how bad it is	1
color me shocked .	1
oh yay . anime to live action films have a history of being good and successful	1
this can only go well	1
it ' s fine , the author is black , and therefore is not racist , remember ?	1
you mean you are not on the edge of your seat waiting for further developments on natasha / bruce ?	1
olaf , the snowman , is actually transgender	1
haha that is pretty funny what a coincidence	1
yep , looks like he has visible abs	1
thank you for stating objectively that one movie is superior to another . and how dare tarantino make an oscar calibre film and not put in a scene directly ripped from the other ? sure the marketing gave no indication that du was a remake , and tarantino repeatedly said in interviews that the name was homage , but the film wasn ' t a remake , but that does not make it right .	1
stop downvoting him . he ' s obviously just expressing his honest opinion based on his extensive knowledge of graphic design .	1
ok . you do not understand . all male roles in the world can only be played by a female american . it ' s our time now .	1
someone needs to stand up for the rights of the white male ! we are falling so far behind !	1
i can not wait to see it !	1
i mean it ' s easy to make that point when you cherry pick the biggest flop of the past decade . they also made 5 of the top 10 highest grossing films of all time , and own 2 of the 3 most valuable / popular franchises in existence . oh , and they own pixar . but yeah they fucked up john carter what a bunch of shit movies they are pumping out	1
starring scarlet johansen	1
wow , another trailer that gives the whole story away .	1
clearly , who would muddy that up with allegations that he ' s going to be given an acting gig ?	1
what a horrible person for daring to care about the plight of people who are worse off !	1
<allcaps> itt </allcaps> : people shitting on sean penn for daring to care about other human beings . how dare he try to raise awareness to the plight of refugees ! what an awful person !	1
what do you mean by they ' s	1
hey , <allcaps> angry birds </allcaps> was out , though !	1
we need an islamic transgender bond or everybody on this thread is a racist sexist bigot .	1
yeah how come trailers never show enough of the movies these days ?	1
legalize abortion until the fetus is 10 years old , i say !	1
take my upvote good sir	1
i wonder what subreddit this guy frequents ?	1
how many times do we have to watch his parents die we know his origin story already	1
yeah , but it was before the end credits , so that counts , right ?	1
why not actually shoot the movie in wakanda ? it would really add to the authenticity of the scenes and stimulate the wakandan economy . it ' s bad enough our corporations are exploiting the country for its precious stones .	1
bitch , stop being a sexist mysogynist	1
no . explosions , one - liners and mayhem are what make star trek great	1
i hate it when movies do not do fictional cartoon orcs justice .	1
" so he will be the bad guy in the movie " " andrea doria " " ? "	1
kobayashi maru , filthy casual .	1
thank goodness ! i know disney was having some trouble making ends meet before this acquisition .	1
no sh*t <censored> , so you mean the main plot point as every game in the series . i wonder if they will all have templar and assassin ' s in the film ?	1
the worlds richest superpower ? yeah , what a failure	1
the worlds richest superpower ? yeah , what a failure	1
over $400 domestic ? that ' s gotta be at least eight people at current movie ticket prices	1
what are you talking about , he died in bvs , he even had two funerals !	1
yes , you are . otherwise you are a misogynist man - baby	1
yeah , that really ruined empire . worst of the series by far .	1
oh great , elizabeth mitchell .	1
but reddit has no problem with women .	1
funny	1
allegedly .	1
i like how it ' s politically charged regarding racism and feminism , like most movies these days .	1
no jake gyllenhaal ?	1
well , to his credit , that ' s not even close to as emotional and human as fighting over a girl .	1
do you not know how gravity works ?	1
and val kilmer was a shitty doc holiday .	1
" geez , first chadwick boseman , then michael b . jordan , and now john boyega ? ! <repeated> i am <allcaps> sick </allcaps> of these darned sjws cramming their * " " diversity " " * down my throat ! "	1
well they have zatanna	1
another masterpiece like hail caeser .	1
but surely a seth rogan movie must have a deeper meaning ? ! <repeated>	1
it ' s like how a if a 5 stands around enough 3 s she will look like a 7	1
that ' s why team america world police did so poorly .	1
yeah because a giant marshmallow man is so realistic .	1
i completely agree . apparently everyone else has already seen the movie and it sucks though .	1
nah man it was * too smart * for marvel audiences !	1
no dude you do not understand . it ' s literally the worst movie ever made and if you enjoyed it you are fucking brain dead	1
<allcaps> you can </allcaps> ' <allcaps> t have a black guy playing the t block </allcaps> ! <allcaps> it will ruin the storyline </allcaps> !	1
coming off the overwhelming success of pixels and battleship , im certain this will be fantastic .	1
i do not get it . the color of their skin is brown not red .	1
i can not wait to watch this underrated movie kiss kiss bang bang i have never heard anything good said about it ever	1
yeah lord of rings were terrible movies	1
because marketing is always 100% correct and there has never been a mistake in a companies marketing before	1
fantastic four too . and x - men days of future past was filled with so many quips too .	1
you know what will help you with the downvotes you are getting ? complaining about downvotes . that always leads to less downvotes .	1
yeah , just like that <allcaps> pos </allcaps> movie * empire strikes back * . movies have to have endings or they suck ! <repeated>	1
unrealistic ? you know the ship really sank , right ?	1
he was also real fond of that taco salad he had last week . let us not get too bent out of shape over his opinion .	1
agreed , nothing like seeing tig ol bitties on the big screen	1
yeah , america has great healthcare , and nobody is ever left financially ruined because of it .	1
" how about the underated movie called " " terminator 2 " " . almost no one seems to have heard of it . "	1
but he ' s called black panther , how can they not be related !	1
still not enough diversity !	1
oh , good .	1
max landis	1
wow , how original and innovative !	1
maybe he will get a cameo in the hotly anticipated all - female reboot of ocean ' s 11 !	1
colin trevorrow .	1
love it love it love it when the trailer gives away most of the story ! awesome !	1
because battleship launched rihanna into stardom .	1
maybe that ' s the plottwist	1
yeah , the one that looks like the best chance to be a good one is the beginning of terrible attempts	1
yeezy gotta pay his debt !	1
jon greyjoy confirmed	1
the projection shots are dated , but at least the skiing shots were real . nowadays we get a more realistic insertion of the actors in scenes , but instead of real shots of a stuntman doing some amazing physical stunts , we get cg people flying down a cg mountain , jumping off a cg cliff and deploying a cg parachute . so exciting	1
you seriously read the articles ? what a loser !	1
damn son . spoiler	1
at least hitler did not make bad movies	1
no worries . it ' s been a year or so since i last watched the film , guess i will just have to make myself sit down and watch it again after work tonight . gosh darn the luck .	1
love the big red arrows . probably would have missed it other wise	1
big surprise .	1
ahem . he ' s only <allcaps> half </allcaps> - guatemalan . he ' s also half - cuban , so we will see how that goes .	1
it ' s cool to shit on it now	1
the movie had 2 whole <emphasis> laughs and people have the guts to say it wasn ' t fun !	1
just kite them	1
a rated r movie with a non violent wolverine . just what we have all been clamoring for	1
i think you are forgetting 102 dalmatians	1
wow ! how do these box offices keep topping previous box offices ? ! <repeated>	1
yeah but how much is that accounting for inflation ?	1
wall - e confirmed mary sue .	1
piracy is destroying the movie industry !	1
yeah he has amazing acting ability and can definitely pull off a french accent	1
what if its just a big conspiracy to bring the all the fox stuff to marvel ?	1
good thing they laid off all those overpaid american it workers .	1
* silently judges you while condescendingly posting about it *	1
<allcaps> wtf </allcaps> this is not the prodigy ! <repeated> what happened to the music from the other trailer ? <repeated>	1
" no they said " " vengence upon thee " " . its completly different . "	1
" " " and i will strike down with great vengeance and furious <elongated> anger , those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers , and you will know , my name is the lord , ' when i lay my vengeance , upon <allcaps> them </allcaps> . " " "	1
you saying this was based on book ?	1
no love for star trek : nemesis ?	1
you take that back . there is not a character out there today as strong as that woman !	1
but . <repeated> but zack snyder can not do anything good !	1
oh no , nothing like that could actually happen . not in an informed democracy .	1
the villians arent actually in the movie , see , batman will just get emailed surveillance videos of them that he will watch instead !	1
could ' ve been michael b . jordan	1
i am pretty sure she is human	1
pretty disappointed they went with a white male han solo , typical hollywood !	1
aww but it was such a great movie	1
yeah , you would know .	1
wow , i am shocked .	1
this is what happens when kristen stewart is not in it ! <repeated>	1
spoiler alert ! you are giving away highlander	1
right , because criterion is totally buying reddit accounts	1
how else would you know the pink and yellow rangers are girls ? ! <repeated> they gotta have the boob armor and the heels or no one will know ! <repeated>	1
because making them pink and yellow wasn ' t an obvious enough hint to their genders of course	1
for equality	1
but how else would you know they are women ?	1
i think he means the good guys defeating the bad guys , ' cause , you know , that ' s exclusive to superhero movies	1
<allcaps> that </allcaps> ' <allcaps> s racist </allcaps> !	1
sucker punch	1
* that we know of *	1
let me know when they cancelled it .	1
thanks for that visual , man !	1
bail contacted obi wan to meet up after he killed obi wan , and they were hiding anakin ' s children . <repeated> ( which he knew because they were hiding the children due to their force sensetivity ) but i am sure it never came up .	1
but comic books are for losers . bryan singer knows cool people only watch comic book movies <emphasis> .	1

you do not think women are funny . just like how some people think men are pigs , right ? but you are not sexist .	1
yeah nemo was terrible , everyone hated that dory character	1

you are triggering the supernatural community .	1
confirmed melissa mccarthy is sexist , cause that ' s the only reason you could dislike this trailer	1

you mean to tell me that you are not tired of the large sassy black lady ? ! <repeated>	1
how else will they get you to buy it twice ?	1
obviously it ' s battle beyond the stars .	1
" i love it when subjective terms like " " cheesy " " and " " meh " " are used to criticize movies . without actually defining what cheesy or meh mean in relation to the film . "	1
good glad they were invited to meet a quota rather than on the merits of their hard work and oscar worthy performances	1
critics just stop watching films after deciding their favorites back in 1979 . that ' s why their favorites do not consist entirely of films from the 2 0 0 0 s .	1
dc is bribing reddit users in order to promote their movie sales !	1
easy for someone with <allcaps> dad privilege </allcaps> to say ! not everyone has a father so how dare imply that everyone has a dad . you were not even thinking when you said that	1
spoilers jeez	1
you have not heard of the disney conspiracy about walt disney secretly being alive and controlling all aspects of hollywood from his lair on the death star ?	1
sexist .	1
it ' s animated so it is for kids .	1
yeah it ' s almost lazy with the amount of parallels between his character in the revenant and what ' s eating gilbert grape	1
i guess we gotta have every movie about white people , we will just fuck up <allcaps> poc </allcaps> .	1
oh so all youre saying is that if i have an opinion that differs from yours about how a film presents is characters then my opinion is wrong . totally fair , not at all a dick move	1
oh shit , you just blew my mind .	1
but it was <allcaps> fun </allcaps> !	1
tbh pulp fiction is a pretty underrated gem amirite	1
warcraft already came out .	1
definitely check out paranormal activity if you wanna watch people walk around a house for an hour a half . it ' s totally worth it for the one or two jump scares the movie has to offer .	1
movies still come in boxes ?	1
but have you seen moon	1
yeah you are absolutely right , king shultz and hans landa were absolutely identical characters with no distinguishing features or personality traits .	1
only real <emphasis> nerds would get this reference	1
what about finding dory	1
but how can that be , when the producers of batman v superman insist the audience does not care about what critics have to say ? clearly this is supported by it ' s 82% record - breaking friday - to - friday dropoff .	1
no , no , he ' s alive in x - men	1
people wanting to talk about a movie are secretly working for marketing at wb ? makes sense .	1
we all know , as long as a movie is dark and gritty it will be a success .	1
i mean they drive motorcycles right ? akira is like the godfather of fast and furious . i mean neo tokyo drift am i right ?	1
no you do not understand , the meaning is <allcaps> so <elongated> </allcaps> deep . you can not truly know someone until you have fought them !	1
like that damn fellowship of the ring and it ' s sequels . copy - pasted from some book by some british fellow . distgusting is what it is . what has the world come to .	1
is that the id4 prequel ?	1
but he has been in several amazing <emphasis> movies , like legend of hercules and the twilight saga !	1
but have marvel ever done a german expressionist film ?	1
this will give the studio more credibility in the event of whitewashing accusations	1
the remain campaign is really picking up steam , and right on time !	1
yes , cause there was absolutely no recycling or sequels happening in the 80 ' s .	1
totally . <repeated> schindler ' s list , saving private ryan , minority report . <repeated> garbage	1
at least we have got rid of all those immigrants	1
what ? ! <repeated> i disliked the video . how are they still making money ?	1

it ' s already been done	1
is this episode <allcaps> vi <elongated> </allcaps>	1
i dropped this	1
typical hollywood !	1
they cast mufasa from the lion king as darth vadar ? ugh , they are ruining the character .	1
you are right . i ' d hate for my business model to be thousands of people at my establishment for 2 hours at a time and the only thing i made money on was $7 popcorn at $6.28 profit and $0.32 in coke that i sold for $7.50 . i know , i know , i can sell the $1 box of candy for $6 but damn it , how am i supposed to make it without a 4000% markup ? <repeated>	1
yet another area where the eu is ruining things	1
you are late because you do not want to get there early so you will not have to watch ads . start the movie 1 0 minute sooner and people will show up at the correct time !	1
no ! , you are not alowed to like it !	1
ugh , fucking casuals , never reading the original comics	1
you are right , that is completely relevant .	1
because west is best dontcha know ? how dare brown people infiltrate the internet and tell us what they like ?	1
guillermo del toro was great as pappy mcpoyle in always sunny in philadelphia so i could see that happening . he ' s got the range to do it .	1
and i am totally sure that people ran out and purchased the blu - rays for those movies that left netflix	1
it revealed they are spies . now the whole movie is ruined .	1
" " " all the music you whipper snappers listen to is garbage because * i <emphasis> * have not heard of it , listen to cher ! " " "	1
hey look , a black guy ! must be miles morales , right ? ! <repeated>	1
because lucas is literally hitler .	1
ok not the reshoots but it would prove pg corporate interference cuz first they said that ' s what ' s gonna be in it . so if it ' s not , must been ordered to take it out . can not have star wars showing real violence , death etc . they never showed arms and heads cut off in the past . . .	1
huh , i had you figured for a stupid religious person for a while there !	1
another death star ? these star wars writers really need some new ideas .	1
maybe they will be turbo rangers	1
the same people who underrated tucker and dale , moon , & cabin in the woods .	1
people are morons .	1
this thread is going well .	1
jar jar binks will be indiana ' s new side kick . get ready for fun !	1

" but is not donald glover already in it ? how many black guys in a movie make a " " black movie " " ? "	1

because the mods know what is best , not the users .	1
<allcaps> what </allcaps> ? pft , are you daft ?	1
i hear its a recent startup with real potential .	1
we will recognise her contribution when she dies thank you very much	1
nah , they are just trying to protect the super surprise cameo from will smith .	1
yeah , a young promising actor dying is absolutely hilarious !	1
yeah , i have never seen another character read an email quite like her .	1
and we all know hollywood is all about realism	1
because anyone who does not conform for an ideal life , such as a night shift worker , is worth less as a human being than i am .	1
but consensual sex leads to violence ! everyone knows that	1
you forget , women are gross .	1
not enough disney .	1
especially since now that we have seen her nudes . no reason to worship her anymore .	1
then why did you team up to form a more perfect union ?	1
they could ' ve save the movie if they got jaden smith to play will ' s son in the movie .	1
but then how would people know it ' s a sequel ?	1
only a true <emphasis> film watcher such as i would know the importance of such things	1
i get what you were trying to say , but you should probably know you would have a panic attack if you went and saw this movie .	1
no duh reddit is a hive mind everyone thinks the same and opinions do not coincide ever .	1
but who does not like shitty reposted skyrim memes that are 5 years old ?	1
yeah , sure thing , the industry decided to sink duncan jones ' movie despite loving his previous output .	1
it has this even lesser known sequel where there ' s this scene in the beginning . <repeated> dude . <repeated> aiden gillen blah blah blah	1
yeah people discussing characters should not mention lines those characters had that they like .	1
they definitely did , but how much can you change when you lead writer is one of your lead actors . i know scotty ' s 26 minute epic monologue will have made the cut	1
good point	1
it ' s a tense and terse neo - noir monolithic crime thriller with overtones of complex meta superhero paradigms that transcend the primitive labels of genre and instead forces the viewer to decipher from the cacophony of abundantly merchandised obsolescence and find a true narrative .	1
so do not go to the fucking movie theater ? but of course they should go to the movie theater , fuck everyone else ' s experience .	1
jar jar binks is the best star wars character and the prequels the best films not only in the franchise but in history .	1
attack of the clones is way better	1
shush . you obviously are not serious enough about movies to have any opinion on them .	1
and they should all look directly at the camera for the entire scene .	1
because only the elimination of male role models is not sexist , <allcaps> shitlorde </allcaps> ` ! <repeated>	1
totally explains why iron man and thor were in the movie	1
" " " <allcaps> my names lara croft and no one close to me will ever backstab me and betray me </allcaps> ! " " "	1
but they had to make room for olivia munn . she was that movie .	1
you want to fire judi dench ? ageist !	1
i for one am ashamed that the new spider man is just <emphasis> black . it ' s <allcaps> current year </allcaps> people ! xe should clearly be a genderfluid , handicapped , bisexual black person who also identifies as wolf - kin	1
beasts of no nation + civil war = black panther ?	1

this , plus gods of egypt and world of warcraft - a weekend marathon awaits .	1
corporations are people too , my friend .	1

they ride on rafts and pull islands from the sea . was pretty clear .	1
to be honest they should definitively start producing netflix originals pornos .	1
i do not remember him in that sandra bullock rom - com .	1
well doh ! we need to show more commercials to make more money , because people is leaving our channel !	1
tom cruise writers union ruined a bunch of tv shows ; hes very selfish	1
if only he had strangled an underage prostitute like any other actor , he would have had no problems getting work again ! but he had to go assault someone with power and influence in the industry instead of victimizing the marginalized like any sane hollywood big - shot . hope he learned his lesson .	1
yeah guardians of the galaxy and the winter soldier are practically the same thing	1
where ' s my runescape movie ? that would be so good	1
yeah why do not people want to drink from this second well , full of features that the people have asked for , after i poisoned the first one	1
haha , yeah , i remember everyone talking about how great the marketing was for this movie	1
were you not only staring at the wall ?	1
pfft <elongated> ofcourse , you think i am a noob ?	1

how dare you shit talk a beloved videogame that was adapted to the best movie of 2016	1
you probably laughed through all the bad parts	1
you know , i was really excited to see this movie , but now that some critic on some site , along with other critics , have given the movie bad reviews , i think i will just pass . it ' s probably the smart thing to do .	1
oh look , another reviewer who does not understand anything about cinema , nice .	1
dude , spoilers .	1
sexist !	1
<allcaps> check your privilege shitlord </allcaps> !	1
i see the issue , they actually needed 17 executive producers to break the tie	1
which is why will smith was the most bankable star for nearly a decade right ?	1
stuckmann reviews almost always make the front page around here , but surprise , his c + review of warcraft has not worked its way up for some reason . i wonder why that could be ?	1
this movie is just a deliberate attempt by people who say terrible things to get away from the negative flak they rightfully received when they uttered hurtful and traumatizing words ! they came to learn that their words have weight and now they want to white wash all the pain they caused with this documentary .	1
no way ! <allcaps> til </allcaps> !	1
man didnt see this coming	1
but deadpool was rated r . now <allcaps> all </allcaps> superhero movies must be rated r .	1
especially when the movie industry has never made money on a movie ever !	1
have not you heard ? it ' s that darn piracy that ' s killing the industry !	1
it ' s not piracy ! it ' s a matter of not supporting a antiquated distribution model !	1
hmm , i expected better from hweird1reviews . com !	1
as i lay dying	1
that reminds me , a friend warned me the same about dota2 , he couldnt be more wrong though , 4000 hours and life is not ruined yet	1
of course , r / movies is the true pantheon of objective criticism these stupid critics do not understand <allcaps> fun </allcaps> movies	1
yes one review clearly sums up what ' hacks ' the rest of these critics are	1
yeah because it flopped and had poor critical reception	1
piracy really is killing the movie industry , they did not even make it to a billion !	1
theyre making a japanese one now too ? ! <repeated> lol <tong>	1
we need black transgender jew for this role !	1
he was black for like , the whole movie !	1
great .	1
oh , that ' s cool . as long as there ' s no actual asian man involved in this movie inspired by genre founded in japan , i am a - ok .	1
the best part is they were not even looking for anyone to be in the movie .	1
hey magneto was straight vegeta in this one . normally he steals the villain ' s plans and tries to wipe out humanity . totally different arc .	1
how can people hate this movie when it has not been released yet ? maybe it is like ghostbusters and they are misogynists	1
i bet it ' s because marvel pays em , amirite guys ?	1
dumb and dumberer .	1
right , because little kids do not live movies or tv shows with talking animals .	1
you mean it will not hit $2 billion ? bold claim .	1
enchanted got a sequel ?	1
i do not know why he would have disdain for hollywood , it seems like such a pleasant atmosphere .	1
ah yeah , it ' s not like batman to attempt to prepare something when he knowingly could not outrun his enemy .	1
from what i learnt in video game pr , its the 29 frames per second	1
fuck you sexist asshole ! <repeated> fury road is the film to define our generation ! <repeated> if you do not like it you are a mysogynistic pig ! <repeated>	1
no thank you , logic need not apply .	1

i do not know , maybe we should get an asian woman to play him .	1
what a wonderful project to attach your name to	1
ya , why would they rebel ? i mean darth vader and his gang seem like such nice and friendly folks .	1
hopefully they cast dwayne johnson .	1
yeah but he said more knowledgable circles . clearly , you are not in them .	1
yeah but guys we can not give into pc culture ! <repeated>	1

its not marvel so it sucks !	1
mulan rogue you mean <tong>	1
you pretentious fuck .	1
but they do reshoots for every movie !	1
why would there be a gravestone when he is so obviously the new joker in suicide squad	1
b-b - b - but pacing !	1
you guys are really making me want to watch this movie now !	1
this is an extremely dark edgy batman so maybe that is what he said	1
the sheer hubris ! trying to make a * war <emphasis> * movie with the title star * wars <emphasis> * ! thank goodness disney put a stop to that nonsense .	1
cause going from british to american is an upgrade , and the other way is a downgrade	1
yeah i mean look <allcaps> rdj </allcaps> he is completely talentless that ' s why he suits the role	1
\ <hashtag> black lives matter </hashtag>	1

but they thanked everyone in the paper ! does not that count for anything ? ! <repeated>	1

sounds like a hack .	1
and we can have all the moviegoers complaining that they ripped off deadpool a bit	1

<allcaps> marvel </allcaps> / <allcaps> dc crossover confirmed </allcaps>	1
merlin ' s beard ! <repeated>	1
just say that you never seen the movie , not even once . and now you have given an opinion on something that you know absolutely nothing at all about . feel good about that moment . <repeated>	1
it ' s not rape if you are attractive .	1
well since the first two negatives cancel each other out , it ' s really only one no and one yes . and people keep saying that positive thinking is more powerful than negative thinking , so by that logic it is true .	1
it ' s a chinese film . there ' s so much whitewashing in chinese cinema , i can see why they ' d be upset	1
you pig !	1
what the fuck are you talking about ?	1
they copied that from dc !	1
good man , the world needs more uncle toms .	1
child rape is not the crime that anti - semitism is .	1
yeah , totally sick of how we can not do blackface anymore too , damn sjws	1
that ' ll teach you to have an opinion you free thinking , thought having , hive mind disagreeing , should just go back to lurking ass bitch !	1
right , because being black automatically makes you a thug .	1
dude , spoilers .	1
ugh , another film set on earth , that ' s not original !	1

how could a wedge pointed at the chest be at all dangerous ?	1
i fail to see the distinction .	1
diegetic whitewashing ?	1
just like i have always said , the world is only big enough for one black female superhero .	1
rudy	1
dude they are white washing it again .	1
this is why i lost interest in hollywood movies , because of plots like this where it ' s so ridiculously unbelievable it ' s impossible to get invested .	1
the reviewers maybe killed themselves ?	1
a movie about accounting ? no way they can make it exiting . i am out .	1
how dare you express a harmless opinion	1

oh my god . someone did an adaptation of a character that allows them to build to something better in later movies , and give them more nuance . how dare they ! batman never killed in the comics or other films	1
it ' s all i have ever dreamed of !	1
are you telling me that while reading the comic you did not get the feeling batman had rooftop sex like three days prior while hunting down a unrelated criminal . because i totally did .	1
so , jump scares ?	1
well , if it ' s page six , count it as truth	1
gee i wonder why	1
millennials just need to shut the fuck up and die , amirite .	1
wasn ' t ' the martian ' a comedy ?	1
do not confuse us with rationality .	1
i understand everything with yt ' s auto translate	1

ugh <elongated> . <repeated> dc fails . they can not even get the trident right ! worst movie already !	1
stop attacking a peaceful religion	1
i do not know , this movie is going to have a hard time passing the high bar set by catwoman and electra .	1
you are right , she should have just given the nearest male character a blow job instead , because that ' s totally <emphasis> more true to the sort of character wonder woman has always been .	1
steven seagal in executive decision . getting caught between the two planes .	1

i loved leonardo dicaprio in goodwill hunting !	1
really hoping for the first glimpse of the harry styles musical number at the climax of the film .	1
yes , christopher nolan should have stayed away from comic book movies and never had made batman begins , <allcaps> the dark knight </allcaps> , and the dark knight rises . those were all shit movies that no one likes .	1
because it has rape	1
it worked for the dark knight so it must work for every other film we make	1
if they are doing reshoots then it must be terrible	1
i blame bad keming on that one .	1
yes let us have a middle eastern person strap bomb collars on to a squad and send them on a suicide mission where several things blow up . to make it more inclusive , let us have them recite the quran while we are at it .	1
oh yeah , obviously star wars 7 .	1
it ' s for disagreeing with me right ?	1
yeah , the religious commentary is brilliant .	1
i assume these arent ranked	1
they renamed indy 5 to uncharted ?	1
jared leto is not muh joker	1

damn right	1
me too . i am just so glad our dutiful mods prevent almost anything good about dc comics from making it to the front page !	1
this movie is a bad influence on people .	1
no dude . did not you know that boringness is an objective qualifier for terrible film .	1
it ' s not racist if she does it .	1
because it ' s not like there ' s any pressure on the telecommunications industry to improve speed and bandwidth to send bigger files faster or anything like that .	1
because no children tried smoking before movies existed .	1
well i am sure this comment thread will not be a shit show	1
but shaw runs in a straight line , therefore it ' s complete shit	1

" hey buddy there ' s no reason to drag american sniper into this . he was a true hero fighting for real freedom , not " " freedom from slavery " " "	1
oh yes , the good guys losing all the time makes extremely good television !	1
well , i am sure this movie will clear up any misconceptions and improve the intelligent racial dialogue we have in this country	1
he do not need to , it is about a black guy killing white people , which means that it has to be part of a liberal anti - white agenda .	1
so is her character going to be called imhotepa ?	1
also i get really annoyed when art has a message . it ' s not supposed to do that	1
hollywood doing nothing but reboots again ! when will they stop milking the birth of a nation franchise	1
well guys , i mean the jewish community just wants sympathy for crimes that occurred a long time ago with people that are in jail with movies about the holocaust so they just make movies now to give germans guilt .	1
ah <elongated> so that justifies the lynchings and killing .	1
i am 24 and i loved johnny quest growing up , so that one point in your well typed out response is invalid . therefore , every opinion you have from here on out is also invalid .	1
well obviously this pic was taken with a zoom lens . problem solved .	1
not provocative enough . nate is really holding out on us this time	1
gender appropriation !	1
darkseid is such a ripoff of thanos , is not he ?	1

and the yellow ranger is supposed to be asian . damn sjws ruin everything ! <repeated>	1
" isnt " " fun " " reserved for marvel movies ? "	1
right , it totally wasn ' t representative of dozens more . my bad !	1
too bad the movie makers do not have hair and makeup teams whose sole purpose on a film is to make people look different than their normal , everyday selves . too bad , what a missed opportunity .	1
" he really does look like a " " honkey muhfuh " " "	1
why ? roland probably just stopped at the laundromat for a quick wash and dry , and then ironed his shirt so it looked presentable for following an evil madman across the desert .	1
maybe they can replace him with a gay character .	1
once again , hollywood has raped my childhood !	1
but . <repeated> but . <repeated> she only makes fat joke !	1
yeah , no men are being vocal about this movie on the internet , that ' s for sure	1
is not disney based in the us ? can not trust them now .	1
where is ezra millers poster , ain ' t he supposed to be the red one ?	1
go back to your basement you shitlord !	1
christ what an asshole !	1
michael bay	1
because it ' s handdrawn ? yeah , absolutely .	1
<allcaps> fucking sexists </allcaps> ! <repeated>	1
well , obviously , a women can write about men and know everything about how a man is likely to act and react to things and why , but men can not do the opposite .	1
maybe it ' ll be in the announced extended edition	1
but omg , he works so hard ! <repeated>	1
dont you mean pacinos last good movie was jack and jill ? because that movie was so <elongated> good i mean adam sandler played a boy and a girl it was hilarious	1
my time is precious .	1
also , the best <emphasis> actor .	1
it has ryan gosling and emma stone ; you are supposed to go see it regardless of the plot . get with the program .	1
non - white male who was unremarkable looking , and by virtue of that , an expendable side note	1
yeah , why are these movies about slavery so racist against white people ?	1
you clearly did not know that all the good reviews come from feminazi shills , though .	1
yes , because everyone ' s review is special <emphasis> and unique <emphasis> and unlike any other review out there .	1
i saw the trailer and that ' s literally her entire character for the whole the movie .	1
because humour is objective and things are either funny or not funny no exceptions .	1
sounds like the perfect modern feminism film then	1
but star wars is not futuristic , it takes place a long time ago , ( in a galaxy far far away . <repeated> )	1
i want jai courtney	1
clearly roper is a sexist who hates women .	1
he ' s probably just a donald trump fan , that ' s why he did not like it	1
yeah it only did 422 million in box office after all	1
this sounds like a comment you can trust	1
what about tom bambadil ?	1
but they look so similar !	1
clearly an opinion matters only if it matches the agenda	1
so , mr . roeper , why do you hate women so much ?	1
<allcaps> sexist </allcaps> ! <repeated>	1
check your white male privilege at the door , you sexist pig .	1
give marvel the rights back !	1
well nolan is top five of all time so <elongated>	1
do not forget about the paid shills ! surely , sony is paying off the lot of the positive reviewers !	1
but even then , remember saddam * wasn ' t that bad *	1
i hope he gets around to doing more period - piece revenge porn	1
helicopter gambit was best gambit dammit !	1
it ' d still be better than ghostbusters ( 2016 ) .	1
but how else can people justify others having a different opinion than themselves ?	1
oh , you know , people .	1
for the * love of god * do not say that . the nitpickers will devour you alive . you can * only say it ' s a shitty movie * after you have seen it . because obviously trailers are not an indicator in this case . and do not go around speaking like you know <emphasis> , eh ? it ' s a capital offense .	1
hey man . disney paid people off . civil war sucked . bvs for life !	1
the fact he has a brand new bentley has nothing to do with his review .	1
dude , that ' s crazy talk	1
sexist rag you mean .	1
no , honestly ! every other review is gonna be awful ! it ' s gonna pound it down to 7% ! <allcaps> this movie is bad and no reviews will change my mind </allcaps>	1
what a sexist review . women do everything better than men .	1
no no no . <repeated> the movie was great , we are just all too misogynistic to realize it .	1
obviously ew is the pinnacle of sexist journalism .	1
yeah fuck opinions !	1
excellent , fuck the world , only the guys on the con are paying for their movies in cinemas .	1
there is no zin - mi , no family . westerners made up the whole thing . go ahead , look .	1
if they are not bashing men in the movie then it ' s not good enough !	1
do not you guys have enough blood on your hands to deal with ?	1
yup we have made a full recovery and the economy is as strong as ever	1
because he ' d be very public on twitter if they were .	1
what are you talking about ? it ' s the best way to advertise and get people to watch your movie : by calling everyone who dislikes what the trailers show a misogynist and a sexist ! that ' ll <allcaps> surely </allcaps> draw the crowds to the movie !	1
it ' s their turn .	1
yea but it has an all female cast - so it ' s perfectly fine .	1
it ' s 2016 bro	1
_obviously_ they are making the movie for non - sexists . if you do not like the movie then you are sexist !	1
ya but its progressive sexism / racism !	1
<allcaps> iirc </allcaps> when they jumped they left holes in the air for sam jackson to follow them through . that has to be what he is talking about	1
the problem i see is none of them were overweight or just full on wackadoodle so they can not have been portraying <allcaps> real </allcaps> women	1
but dude , what about the sexual liberation of women ? it ' s acceptable for women to gawk at men , in fact it ' s seen as just a little bit of harmless fun . men can never gawk at women without just turning them into sexualised objects though , because men are sexist scum !	1
4 white guys ? what are you ? racist ? ! <repeated>	1
men in this film are a great example that women do not need to put men down to feel empowered .	1
but . <repeated> but . <repeated> but womyns ! <repeated> it has to be good because the womyns ! everyone here is just a cishet white male who hates womyn .	1
oh , you ' d like to do that , would not you mr . man	1
ghostbusters 2016 sucks ? i am surprised and baffled	1
thats only okay if they are white ! duh <elongated>	1
maybe thats why we never heard of you yet .	1
" hey , they are going to get great " " exposure " " from that tiny indie movie . who needs to get paid ! "	1
brave words from a bold man . what a visionary	1
spoiler alert .	1
pretend racism does not exist and it will just go away . problem solved .	1
more than <allcaps> oitnb </allcaps> ? ! <repeated>	1
the costumes suck , evidently this movie will be crap .	1
stop being homophobic we can not let the normal people forget that gay people exist and are <allcaps> totally normal </allcaps>	1
they said the same thing about heath ledger .	1
but this is not the same sulu . when old spock went back in time it created an alternate reality where he became gay at that time . duh !	1
yeah , why can not we only have white men in film ? all this pandering to different races and genders is driving me crazy .	1
what do you mean ? how else would we know he ' s mentally unstable ?	1
we should just never add any gay characters !	1
yep . that ' s a good sign when your movie is so bad , the digital projector becomes self aware and stops working when it has to play your shitty movie .	1
a star trek in the spirit of the tv franchises ? no way , nobody saw those or liked them .	1
all i care about is their sexual orientations .	1
it makes sense that cho ' s character be gay in a nod to takei . now all we need is for takei ' s twitter feed to be straight for a while in a nod to cho	1
yeah , because ' gulliver ' s travels ' was <allcaps> the best </allcaps> .	1
you just have to shut off your brain for 2 hours it ' s just a movie	1
yeah , what subhuman trash , linking to the article in a top comment . obviously they want to hide the truth .	1
what a homophobe . check your privilege shitlord .	1
yeah but she ' s not <allcaps> really </allcaps> lesbian because her slug is a boy .	1
they are gonna <allcaps> cgi </allcaps> some breasts onto his love interest .	1
typical asian potato queen ! ugh !	1
i agree . let us make everyone straight and white , resembling the world as it should be .	1
oh shit . time to fix your gaydar !	1
his performance was stellar in rocky and bullwinkle for sure !	1
running a whale wash . <repeated> its like they were working from the same script	1
those are the best ones ! semi	1
leslie jones .	1
well this obviously means that she ' s part of the conspiracy .	1
read the article ? ! <repeated> why would anyone do that when they can come straight to the comments instead .	1
wow ! so many movies !	1
totally not exploiting a recent tragic event	1
heyo <elongated> ! <repeated> burn alert ! <repeated>	1
because disney needs to advertise on a subreddit for a movie that everyone wanted to see since the title was announced	1
it ' s only homage when tarantino does it , right ?	1
the south will rise again .	1
so what women can not participate in panty raids ? i though it was the current year .	1
huh . <repeated> i am partial to norm of the north myself	1
they are obviously trying to capture the <allcaps> doom </allcaps> crowd and capitalize on the release of the new game .	1
would have been a pretty pointless translation if the giant wasn ' t big .	1
" " " i thought it stood for the big fucking giant " " "	1
yes , apparently karl urban only excels as an actor if his face is half - obscured by a helmet .	1
robert downey jr . as iron man	1
well , <allcaps> til </allcaps> about my culture .	1
nope , just needed a snickers	1
you dropped this :	1
great clickbait site .	1
i find the cinematography in the intermission to be lacking , quite disappointing frankly	1
are saying you do not see it ? it ' s pretty clear . it a product designed to clean up your mess so you do not have to deal with it . it ' s practically housecleaning welfare	1
you must be godly looking	1
well star wars episode 4 was pretty good	1
yeah , half his torso is probably filled with empty space or redundant fluid or something . he ' s an alien so anything goes	1
you spelled plot hole two different ways . what a plot hole that is .	1
because teh voice actor is black , so jar jar is a racist cartoon , am i rite guise ?	1
" yea . <repeated> he probably wrote that word into the script thinking " " i have no idea what this means hhahaha " " . "	1
nah , man , avatar was great !	1
me	1
what are you talking about ? ! <repeated> doomsday was the most fully realized antagonist of any movie in the past 10 years . his motives were clear , his plan devastatingly cunning and he earned his brief win . you genuinely felt bad for him even when he was laying waste to an abandoned island . let us stop this pointless debate and write wb for a stand alone ~ ~ cave troll ~ ~ doomsday movie post haste .	1
and then that ' s probably why i do not watch any of the fast and furious films . car chases are not my thing . oh well guess i am missing out	1
you think that would be the case ? that maybe if the movie was better it would be better recieved ? no way bro .	1
nah man , you have to be 100% original or you are a shitty writer . that ' s why i hate shakespeare , or as i like to call him , fakespeare .	1
i know man . also music made after 2001 sucks !	1
can confirm , am mormon , have 0 friends .	1
what would he know about bad movies ?	1
yeah , they do not even speak the actual mayan language . literally unwatchable !	1
still , he * * * <allcaps> fought </allcaps> * * * , you understand ? ! <repeated>	1
do not interrupt the circlejerk .	1
star wars had never used movies to sell toys before disney bought them , they ruined it .	1
i like how the entire plot recycles itself in the middle of the 2 nd act	1
sounds like somebody scuffed yo shoes , man . fuck ' im up !	1
yeah the emperor showing up in a movie where the empire is at it ' s peak would have been gratuitous	1
damn what a fall from grace	1
they show bruce wayne ' s mom and dad getting killed outside the theater . for some reason , they decided to exit the theater in an dark alley at night in crime ridden gotham .	1
it ' s been longer than a few hours dude . lighten up .	1
just replace him with a black actor . his skin color is not important to the story .	1
yeah , but that ' s * * all <emphasis> * *	1
great , it ' s that deadpool ripoff	1
well pluto nash did so well decades later	1
good that it ' s only another two months till it comes to germany	1
does not have colorful birds with rehashed pop music . no thanks .	1
i remember ranma 1 / 2 having a couple of episodes like that	1
because what does that story matter ?	1
goddamn it !	1
that ' s why he makes the big bucks .	1
but there are women in it , did not you listen ? <repeated>	1
<allcaps> nut obvius u fukin wite sis mail </allcaps> !	1
halle berry played catwoman ?	1
i think you forgot mila kunis and her stunning portrayal of the wicked witch	1
yeah , knowing you do not look good bald and then starting to lose hair is . <repeated> delightful .	1
you have forgotten them a week later anyway . better get hyped for the next one though because this time it ' s gonna have real <emphasis> consequences .	1
django unchained could not get made today .	1
how about you make like a screen door on a battleship and get outta here ?	1
it ' s spawned some of the dankest movie memes though and that ' s all that matters	1
that may have just been him responding to a fan . or to jim carrey .	1
yeah i also really enjoy that they completely changed his character in zack snyder ' s murderverse .	1
oh come now , the japanese were just super advanced at special effects ! have not you seen the godzilla movies from back then ? <repeated>	1
because that ' s the only french movie with nudity in it	1
i am shocked . i thought for sure he ' d celebrate it as a great humanitarian act worthy of a nobel prize	1
never heard of it	1
but she ' s playing a negative black stereotype in the movie . we people of reddit do not like seeing black people portrayed negatively .	1
she was the most high profile unfunny woman in ghostbusters <emphasis> and that ' s the justification in some people ' s minds . so you know , clearly the punishment fits the crime .	1
you are right . guess we will not be needing all these iron man toys anymore .	1
hey , they are just a casual heroin user . nothing wrong with that .	1
the sopranos seems to work well after goodfellas	1
it ' s ok , i have got an answer to this problem . an all female oceans eleven ! it ' s going to be awesome	1
i am sure the reddit discussion on this film will be pretty fun and very even tempered .	1
who could have seen that coming ?	1
the same box set without the hobbit movies will be $1000 .	1
cannibal : the musical	1
but what about that ben - hur remake that everybody was super excited for ?	1
that ' s why the film flopped , no homosexual themes that nobody even notice in the original remake until those letters came out years later , and is still argued about whether it was intentional or not .	1
i agree . the third one did not have enough alfrid in women ' s clothes	1
dissapointed to not see jackie chan	1
not trying to be racist but jackie chan ' s double looks identical .	1
thanks , we will definitely consider this !	1
oh boy , i can not wait for some unrealistic , hyper - romanticized version of childhood love / crushes to be violently forced down my throat	1
fuck well water . too much iron .	1
do not forget part 3 !	1
do not you know that obviously fake gore and blood is a million times worse than hardcore porn ?	1
nice job respecting his opinion while offering yours .	1
yeah , an organization with a billion members who annually do more charitable contributions than pretty much anyone else . so much trash .	1
another remake nobody asked for bombed ! <repeated> what <elongated> ?	1
reported for hate speech against my fellow gingers . <repeated> we make up less than 2% of then entire human population . that makes us one of the smallest minority groups around , ya <allcaps> racist </allcaps> .	1
gotta love america . filthy jokes ? r - rated . ultra - violence ? g . with blood , pg . with brains and gore and one shot of boobs or saying a swear word , pg - 13 .	1
" at my old job they had us ask to take bathroom breaks . i told my boss " " hey , i am running to the bathroom " " he said " " you know you can use the bathroom on break " " which was an hour before this point and an hour and half away til the next one and no one cared when you went but he seemed quite aggravated today . so i just looked at him confused and said " " yeaa . <repeated> and if i need to use the bathroom during break i will . " " then i took a nice 45 min poop "	1
but his family died in the holocaust and his pregnant wife was murdered ! cut him some slack , you guys !	1
" she threw a cup of piss at someone ' s face . doubt she cares about her " " reputation " " at this point . "	1
i know right ? one would think reddit would be more tolerant towards child rapists	1
but disco ! is not disco just fucking <allcaps> hilarious </allcaps> ?	1
was deer hunter really better than shampoo ?	1
oh , so just because he ' s black he ' s shifty and second - best to a white man ? <allcaps> racist </allcaps> !	1
yeah you are the only one , hence why it made $100 million dollars , most people must think it ' s terrible	1
also known as lights out .	1
goodness me , how <allcaps> will </allcaps> audiences cope . <repeated> ?	1
yes , because there ' s no way that disney let him say this	1
have you seen toy story ? he is by far not the worst part of that movie .	1
they are gonna do one 3 - hour movie , and then leak out the rest of the footage as a televised miniseries over the next 9 months to bide time until the next marvel superhero extravaganza .	1
but jerking another guy is gross and weird !	1
the shawshank redemption is pretty good but you have probably never heard of it .	1
what about inglorious bastards	1
i had no idea that movie was even happening until a few days ago when i saw a trailer that included a quote of endorsement from joel osteen , so count me in .	1
also the color of the napkins you can not see on the table represent his sorrow during the scene . it really shows through when the camera cuts out because just like how we can not see the characters , conner can not see through his own flaws .	1
because maryjane looking accurate to the comic is hands down , more important than anything going on in the world .	1
i agree , who the hell could like that piece of shit	1
yeah because those are so hard to find	1
and del toro knew <emphasis> this . that ' s why he ' s mexico ' s brad pitt .	1
i always wanted to see the dead bodies in 3 d . to really feel like i am there with them .	1
oh great . this should be fun .	1
and we all know women of color do not wear wigs	1
i wonder if he got tricked into this aswell .	1
this will be the happiest go lucky show out there .	1
shut up you big fat <allcaps> sjw </allcaps> meanie !	1
peter would not be able to carry her if she was .	1
well its been a long time since there was a controversial casting choice in hollywood to fire up reddit	1
dont forget the mysterious cut scenes that must be great and totally redeeming to the whole movie	1
that ' s not comparing apples to oranges . seems like a coherent argument .	1
yeah that one good movie not those pieces of shit like fight club , panic room , mr . nobody and dallas buyers club .	1
so you are not excited about the ben hur reboot ?	1
probably should have used	1
superman looking depressed while saving people ? how inspiring !	1
should have been chris pratt !	1
having to watch ghost dad is worse than getting raped .	1
if we make more mess = = more jobs = = economy fixed .	1
i did what i thought deadpool would do and left my shit anyway .	1
have fun ruining the horror movie for yourself .	1
i too like to watch a godzilla movie where they pan away from almost every fight .	1
hey would not it be great if they made it a netflix / <allcaps> hbo </allcaps> miniseries ?	1
because the board game is at the peak of popularity and the old movie was an absolute disaster .	1
wait . <repeated> ben - hur is going to flop ? ! <repeated> really ? ! <repeated> man , i did not see this one coming . not in a million years .	1
that ' s not enough ! i demand to know when the studio heads will have their lunch where they decide how big the reshoots will be !	1
am i the only one thats a little disappointed that hollywood is going to ruin yet another classic film with another shitty remake ?	1
trickle down economics <allcaps> works </allcaps> ! <repeated>	1
they could always <allcaps> cgi </allcaps> it .	1
because a woman could never , has never written a sexually disturbing scene in any way .	1
b but it was intentional <emphasis> you idiot ! you just did not get <emphasis> it	1
yeah you are right better to do nothing at all	1
<allcaps> lol nice </allcaps> .	1
yeah , because theres nothing different about those two situations . nothing at all .	1
spoilers dude ! <repeated>	1
it ' s shaped like a contact lens because they are opening our eyes and making it clear that bush did 9 / 11	1
of course he did . he implied she could not act . the academy members who nominated her for best actress in pride and prejudice must have all been wrong !	1
no ! do not you see ? ! <repeated> the patterns they translate to binary which when decoded explains the entire of plot of the next seventeen dc movies ! <repeated>	1
not ham fisted at all .	1
but warcraft doing bad was deserved .	1
so there ' s hope we can finally get a movie about the origin of spiderman ?	1
you know i can not wait until the hateful eight is added as well . a masterpiece for sure .	1
toxic masculinity !	1
batman does something most people could not even conceive of doing . that ' s not batman like at all !	1
no do not you understand ! they got temporary <allcaps> ptsd </allcaps> from all the guns !	1
we definitely needed another post about suicide squad .	1
people study acting ?	1
so then we are not counting the guy who went skydiving without a parachute ?	1
they really should have fit more cuts into that video .	1
yes , that ' s a very appropriate reaction to inconvenient media . no need for links to news as it happens or posts from important people while on reddit , the front page of the internet .	1
oh yeah , cause digital cameras do not need to be focused , right ?	1
do you think they could have had some more cuts ? it was too easy to follow the jump with so few cuts .	1
yeah , it ' s brilliant in that way .	1
the joker possessed him and made <emphasis> him od . duh .	1
think they needed a few more quick cuts on the final jump	1
are you sure that is not just the movie ?	1
but it ' s so wrong though <laugh>	1
i thought it was the apollo moon landing .	1
no , everybody hated it , that ' s why it was a critical and commercial failure	1
nice grasp of the english language	1
m <elongated> , minors . <repeated>	1
you are right ! how dare people post news related to the people who pay for the movies we watch ! in fact , why are people posting so much about this kenny baker dying ?	1
gods of egypt will make a strong showing in that category	1
obviously she ' s getting paid less because she chose a different career path than her male counterparts	1
what ? that ' s absurd , how the hell could a rag tag group of rebels outsmart the empire and steal the plans ? does not seem realistic .	1
<allcaps> alright </allcaps> ! maybe they can introduce brainiac and make him nothing like the comic books , then superman can break his neck in the last 10 seconds .	1
no , it ' s not as long as the woman is little more than a passive sex object . that ' s _realism . _	1
like in star wars	1
hey has anybody seen this underrated gem stranger things on netflix ? it seems as if no one is talking about it . it is very simlar to et and 8 0 s nostalgia is pretyy good .	1
wow i bet no one saw this coming .	1
this movie comes before episode 4 , this is a break from our current place the the timeline ( the next episode chronologically would be <happy> . i sincerely hope you understand now because you will be confused watching the movie in december	1
bro i know right ?	1
but what about the sequels ?	1
what about the flintstones ?	1
nah mate , v for vendetta is pretty much a spiritual successor to star trek	1
i am just waiting for the death star 4 .	1
oh come on , why not ask that he massacre a roomful of children ?	1
wow it ' s almost like that show would have been wildly expensive back in the 6 0 s o . o who knew	1
wait , they will let them go away with destroying 30 % of the planet ?	1
fucking george lucas ruining everything , that ' s how	1
damn teenagers . i am glad i <emphasis> wasn ' t like that when i was younger .	1
further proof that predominantly male - led movies are box office duds .	1
how dare you state your subjective opinion about which one you prefered ! get the pitchforks lads !	1
alright . which one of you cock suckers did not watch the movie ?	1
damn white people all look alike	1
" can not wait for the " " ruined my childhood ! " " crowd to get their hands on this one . "	1
it was supposed to go off as sarcasm , but i guess its my fault for not adding	1
i am shocked	1
personally , i do not car about what you love .	1
bald men need to be made fun of right ?	1
clearly that ' s why the movie bombed so hard it lost $70 million .	1
gee , that was unexpected .	1
thanks , misogyny !	1
i am glad you are getting the real point of the movie .	1
i do not care about this movie , but the whole obsession with seeing this movie fail is strange . there have been far worse movies ( and more successful ) out there that have not seen this kind of outrage . you all call sjws sensitive , but can not seem to stop ranting about being called sexist for not liking this movie . because we all know being called sexist is like the most oppressive thing ever , i really hope someone was there for you guys in those difficult times .	1
sweet ! another reboot . just what we need .	1
now listen here you cis male scum . you are the bigot the * * * <allcaps> real </allcaps> * * * ghost busters is a wonderful film about woman empowerment . you are just scared that the film industry might not be controlled by the patriarchy any more after this master piece . it ' s because of people like you that women and <allcaps> poc </allcaps> have had such a hard time making it in the film industry . now check your privilege before you trigger me .	1
society is sexist !	1
<allcaps> damn you misogyny </allcaps> ! <repeated>	1
the patriarchy at work !	1
we did it reddit !	1
what are you talking about ? it only made a $180 million at the box office , that proves that no one wanted to see it .	1
yeah <elongated> , but at least there were no straight cis males !	1
clearly the the entire world is just sexist for not liking this film .	1
it only didnt profit because everyone who didnt pay to go see it is a women hating scumbag .	1
aww hell naw !	1
proof that girls are not funny .	1
that ' s what happens when you send a woman to do a mans job . amiright ?	1
it is all the bernie bros fault	1
well your niece clearly has a case of internalized misogyny .	1
color me surprised .	1
crucify all the critics who give dc movies negative reviews ! <repeated>	1
did not you read all the other replies ? it ' s really because you are desperate for your daddy ' s love and are willing to go home with anyone that validates you .	1
plow ? plow what ? the driveway ? please kind sir be more specific .	1
iono man i mean while bvs was shit theatrically and dc , watchmen was shit theatrically but <allcaps> amazing dc </allcaps> . <repeated> i think he just doesnt get the freedom he wants . i blame the producers for bvs because we all know how well dc makes movies	1
but the prequels had great ideas !	1
boy , they do not know what they are missing not casting the supporting actress of such revered cinematic hallmarks as * house on haunted hill * , * final destination 2 * , and * resident evil : afterlife * .	1
" what the fuck are you talking about when you say " " rewound " " ? like select the first scene before taking out the movie ? dvd players have their own individual memory , not the discs . so it will always start from the beginning given that it has not been played in that player before . "	1
" i think that issue was called " " the force awakens . " " "	1
cause shut up .	1
yeah fuck leto ! <repeated> he should have fucking died like ledger did ! <repeated>	1
they should make a pg13 version of this movie like they did deadpool .	1
obviously the need to throw more banter and moder music to it .	1
jeremy renner is in it .	1
it also got compared to dungeons & dragons , compared to an animated advertisement for an iphone app game , and called the worst movie of the year . but the critics were being fair .	1
but what about mad max : genesys ?	1
that ' s so pretentious . <repeated> lets remake the movie just to teach him some humility !	1
at this point hollywood ought to just throw caution to the wind and remake all successful films after a period of no later than 5 years .	1
i am sure they loved the live rats and anal beads	1
good . because , as he said himself , men just are not funny and it shows that this was directed by a man .	1
hey , let us just do a remake of charlie ' s angels with 3 super effeminate dudes too while we are at it .	1
ya but it did not have more women so there wasn ' t a reason to get up in arms despite that one being worse .	1
because nobody knows those other actors and their mouths dont match up with what they say 100% , literally unwatchable	1
this is clearly too political , shut it down !	1
it ' s not okay for the poor kids either . their ears are much more sensitive than adult ' s . hearing damage , emotional trauma from loud scary noises ? yay	1
but what about the <allcaps> nsa </allcaps> they will still know ?	1
speaking of which , have you heard about this underrated gem dredd ? not many people on this sub talk about it .	1
who the hell looks at ratings on a cartoon ?	1
as a theater worker who already saw parents outraged at deadpool , which was advertised even more obviously as an adult movie , i can not wait .	1
the star wars prequels !	1
indonesia is inherently hilarious .	1
an actor known for being the pretty boy was cast as the joker ? that ' ll <allcaps> never </allcaps> work . <repeated>	1
do not cut yourself on all that edge	1
yeah , it ' s really incredible how people downvote posts that suck !	1
holy shit black people and latinos go to movies	1
they should make a public apology and issue refunds + damages for having wasted the time of moviegoers .	1
stop it ! <repeated> he ' s damaged ! you do not understand him !	1
nah man , superman totally killed those soldiers with bullets . he flicked them at them to show how much of a god he is compared to us lowly humans .	1
you want a coherent plot written by people who have a basic understanding of the character franchise ? how absurd .	1
maybe they will lose money .	1
this seems a bit political mods	1
yeah , the american weapon destroying a lot of major cities instead of an alien destroying the two major cities is obviously better	1
this guy is a genius	1
do you have any evidence to back that up ? ! <repeated>	1
but , as everyone knows , nobody gives a shit about animation in 2016 ! it ' s all gotta be in real life , with real actors , and * real <elongated> * effects !	1
it ' s actually [ weekend at bernie ' s ]	1
yeah everyone knows snyder cut 30 min out of his own film , creating holes in the narrative that made him a pariah in the eyes of the fans . that so snyder lol	1
great . <repeated> we americans will have to learn more about history to appreciate a movie .	1
but black people can not be racist towards whites !	1
batman v superman : dawn of justice and suicide squad	1
<allcaps> yeah </allcaps> fuck them	1
what a marvelous job she ' s doing then !	1
they are getting checks from marvel and disney , i guessed you missed the announcement	1
is this film called tom hanks or is it called sully ?	1
oh , that would have put the asses in seats !	1
radical islam obviously .	1
what do you mean ? the new ghostbusters is literally <emphasis> the worst movie of all time and everyone involved should be culled .	1
i just want a decent superman movie . <repeated> like , with actual character development and stuff . i want to like the movie not based on the fact i like the pre - existing character , but because the movie makes me care about clark kent and his ( weird and different from most people ) struggles . superpowers , but he ' s still got to fit in at school , he still hangs out with friends , he ' s got to adjust to the city , he ' s still got to try and win over the girl . <repeated> but no , moping around all moody and stuff is enjoyable and artsy to some people .	1
need to read that book again knowing it ' s based on the guy who played spiderman	1
yeah margot robbie should cover up . and what are they thinking getting the guy from fresh prince ?	1
so i also found this one bad review on google news . put that on your todo list .	1
what a shitty move , for them to protect their brand and continue to integrate their cinematic universe in a way that ' s rewarding for fans , enriches the content , and has served them well for the better part of a century	1
pussy .	1
only if aliens are included , otherwise all bets are off !	1
of course .	1
have you seen <emphasis> national treasure ?	1
now , that ' s an original casting choice	1
a film directed by george lucas would have been a mess if he ' d had total creative control ? nah , i can not imagine that !	1
nah man , people who shop at hot topic are not interested in athletics .	1
straight outta compton with the kings , dodgers , and raiders gear .	1
this should be deleted since it only puts more controversy to the whole ghostbusters - discussion	1
<allcaps> thought police </allcaps> ! you have posted a video that mildly criticizes the work of women which is a threat against all women ' s lives . mods remove this thread at once as my feels are more important than their opinions !	1
maybe they did montage to set the stage for a possible flashback to another timeline where jim howlett is with the unit .	1
i for one am shocked	1
" can you use the word " " edgy " " a few more times to describe it ? i do not think this was enough . "	1
literally the worst movie ever made . it has so so much liam neeson in it it ' s not even redeemable .	1
marvel is paying reviewers to can the <allcaps> dceu </allcaps> , duh	1
silence , peasant . you do not know what discussion is good and / or appropriate . the glorious people on the right side of history will tell you what you may or may not discuss .	1
yeah . women hate that !	1
yeah like renaming cincinnati to harambe city	1
822 supporters and counting , the revolution is now !	1
" well then , i vote " " pulp fiction " " . "	1
that ' s such a great way to tell the world that you have faith in your product	1
" or you could just read his tattoos ! " " damaged " " , " " <allcaps> ha ha ha ha </allcaps> " " . get it ? "	1
careful , try not to cut yourself on that edge .	1
darn , i was hoping 4 kids would get the rights	1
are you kidding ? marvel movies are cinematic achievements and are a perfect balance of entertainment and fan service . they are untouchable .	1
just because people decided it was literally the worst movie ever 18 months before it was released does not mean it was due to bias !	1
bro , cosmorocks said so ! that ' s all the reason you need !	1
how dare you have your own opinion and try to intelligently state that opinion .	1
just because she thinks women earn less than men because of a conscious decision to does not mean she ' s crazy	1
how dare everyone rip off the 3 act structure .	1
towns too . looks like they have a lot of work to do .	1
they gotta be objective , man !	1
cause they are waiting to get the license back	1
yeah but they did not serve me a portion of foreshadowing on a silver platter so it does not count .	1
in the future , black lives matter !	1
like ghostbusters ?	1
hey , pipe down - - we are circlejerking about how much zack snyder sucks over here	1
stupid americans with their overweight kaiju and bad posture	1
it ' s not underrated enough	1
it seems he and efron should be in comedy duo movie .	1
yeah , all anime looks the same .	1
<allcaps> til </allcaps> someone got paid for king kong	1
" " " i am sexually attracted to a gender that i have never seen that does not exist where i am from " " makes way more sense . they need to stop pushing this gay agenda "	1
i love sally field in this era . what was her job in the movie ? been awhile . how could she afford it ? ! <repeated>	1
you are just a butthurt christian .	1
the raid 2 is not on here and neither is hard boiled . invalid	1
you mean the one with john brolin ?	1
hopefully they stick to the source material !	1
sure , did not you know that gotg was the first movie ever to include popular music in the film ?	1
starring jennifer lawrence and chris pratt ! one holds the blue portal gun , the other the orange . <repeated> can they escape together and find true love along the way ?	1
i agree , super 8 was a terrible film .	1
" what ? ! <repeated> you did not like the great jared leto ' s " " hunka hunka " " ? you fucking monster . "	1
hoping for a breaking bad bacon birthday scene	1
c ' mon fellini and von trier practically go together !	1
an all female reboot of the lion king is required .	1
pssh , i only watch extended , uncut , director ' s cut editions of films . i watch the original uncut version of das boot like a short film .	1
you trying to say that being the president is not american enough ?	1
it has men kissing that ' s not safe for anyone	1
i hope they give him a bigger gun this time !	1
oscar hopeful film popping in on a limited release just before the end of the year ? never heard of such a tactic .	1
you might also be interested in watching this small niche film about a man from a wealthy family who , after experiencing a tragedy , goes on a pilgrimage of self discovery and comes back to his home town with ambitions of making it a better place . not sure if you have heard of it , but it ' s called * batman begins * .	1
sh <elongated> , this about how the main star has a family because of these movies , not about how some families do not have theirs because of these movies .	1
nice to see marvel adding more asian perverts .	1
did not you know everything will be shit no matter what ? even if <allcaps> you </allcaps> enjoyed it , it ' s still shit .	1
i guess that makes the third one a political thriller !	1
the new ghostbuster <emphasis> ? which one ?	1
what show is this from ?	1
and <elongated> there ' s another studio ghibli production i am going to be forced to go see . poor me .	1
of course . did they not see the high demand for a remake of * ben - hur * ?	1
yeah but it ' s 30 year old made for tv movie effects are not up to par with the 100 million dollar movies of today	1
you do realize that it takes a zombie apocalypse for a white girl to get it going with an asian guy ?	1
you should have taken her to see gone girl	1
<allcaps> nsfw </allcaps> , gawd .	1
that is sexist talk . pratt ' s boobs might be smaller and less perkier than jennifer ' s but all boobs are beautiful and deserve to be treated the same man , or you are a sexist piece of shit with a small dick .	1
what do you mean ? there ' s a role for asian men that ' s not karate ? or a role for asian women that ' s not a docile , submissive , but sexually curious into white men ?	1
it worked for her in ghost world . <repeated> why should not it work for her in every single film she ' s starred in since then , regardless of genre , plot , character development or context !	1
safe to say avi arad plucked her from obscurity based on her acting potential and not just because of his relationship to the marvel cinematic universe .	1
oh come on , the live action <allcaps> dbz </allcaps> could not be that bad .	1
she ' s a celebrity , i deserve to see her nekkid ' cause i have pirated three of her films and she makes me feel funny in my pants !	1
well , know we know the big secret chris pratt had to tell jlaw . thanks for the spoiler alert .	1
yes , all japanese secretely wish they were white .	1
woaw , a girl who likes idiocracy , you must be a pilot or something .	1
how much longer until they pull the stereotyping character out of the film ?	1
wait , that makes no sense . safer to just remake it with an american cast .	1
hopefully we will get a much better orange and blue poster with cool fonts and floating heads !	1
nah , he ' s a hack . lightning only struck thrice .	1
i ' d much rather they just did all those scenes with a british accent for some reason	1
it ' ll never hold up to the caliber of such cinematic masterpieces as god ' s not dead and god ' s not dead 2 !	1
but ant - man turning giant was <allcaps> totally </allcaps> real .	1
r / hailcorporate	1
look for ' virtue signalling ' , which is something liberals do to show other liberals how good they are , and definitively * not <emphasis> * something radical conservatives do to show how radical they are	1
now you just spoiled it for him .	1
i feel sorry brad most of all . poor guy gets rid of his wife , which he apparently did not much want , and a bunch of kids . all he has to show for it is his fame and freedom . poor man really . also it ' ll probably be difficult for him to get back into the dating game at his age .	1
because only edgy liberal teens care about their privacy being violated .	1
how tf can i go to work now ? ! <repeated>	1
yeah , because star trek is for abnormal people .	1
dude . clearly anyone who can be fooled into giving up their password deserves to have pictures of their sex life posted all over the internet . i mean come on , they were practically asking for it .	1
and yet , the move <allcaps> still </allcaps> wont make any money !	1
are you implying that people will show up to a movie if the female lead is not 95% naked ? well sir , i will have you know that you are just way off .	1
you just want everything handed to you on a silver platter do not you ? this man has given you the tools <emphasis> to find this , now go succeed . freaking millennials , sheesh .	1
wow you are right , i never though of it like that ! you have changed my whole view ! this movie <allcaps> does </allcaps> blow !	1
it ' s so <elongated> old ! <laugh>	1
i hear people keep throwing pizzas on the roof .	1
yeah , that never happened . do not know what you are talking about .	1
yeah , this is totally gonna end well	1
maybe if we are lucky they will team up leto and eisenberg .	1
lets have another raptor - human - trex nod ! that was fucking cinema history ! <repeated>	1
said every chris brown / bill cosby fan ever . but it ' s ok cause they are black	1
disney paid off the audience	1
this	1
it ' s okay because it happened to a man .	1
requiem for a dream	1
yeah they should just be grateful for all that vile criticism and child molesting !	1
finally , a conspiracy oliver stone is a part of .	1
but a live action remake of the little mermaid sounds like such a good idea !	1
<allcaps> oh my god </allcaps> , <allcaps> he must have an anti </allcaps> - <allcaps> dc agenda </allcaps> ! <allcaps> start writing the petitions </allcaps> ! <allcaps> we must kick mr </allcaps> . <allcaps> stuckmann off the internet </allcaps> ! <repeated>	1
have we seen any kryptonian do that ? maybe kryptonians cant smile ! take that <allcaps> dce </allcaps> haters !	1
that ' s why i refused to watch any of the thor movies or black swan . natalie portman is still being taken advantage of by sick older men .	1
but the fight scenes were so engaging ! did not you see all those explosions ? who cares whether we like the main character ? he ' s superman ! you <allcaps> have </allcaps> to like him regardless of the little characterization he ' s given !	1
i can not wait for them to create a whole spawn cinematic universe !	1
but i thought superman died	1
yeah , if there ' s one thing reddit hates , it ' s the sexualization of women ! <repeated>	1
oh boy	1
i hope zach snyder is directing it !	1
it ' s a woman so it does not count ! <repeated>	1
how could that be possible if superman died at the end of batman vs . superman ? ! <repeated> <allcaps> what a twist that would be if he came back </allcaps>	1
tell that to chris stuckmann	1
wait , you mean superman did not really die at the end of bvs ? who woulda thunk it .	1
<allcaps> you mean superman </allcaps> ' <allcaps> s not dead </allcaps> ? ! <repeated> <allcaps> omg no way </allcaps> ! <repeated>	1
along with preordering games .	1
darn warrior princesses going around , fighting the good fight for centuries , teasing us mere mortals .	1
* come on * , that ' s obviously a symbolism that she ' s basically the saint that saved the alliance from losing the war	1
but then how will i let people know that the new ghostbusters is a masterpiece that the world deserves ?	1
but . <repeated> but . <repeated> the reshoots were totally planned !	1
but . <repeated> but the highly paid execs are job creators ! do you hate freedom ? ! <repeated>	1
the lawyers would have you believe they should have seen this coming .	1
a few bad reddit comments would differently make me reconsider my multi - million dollar contract .	1
" yes , this movie will totally be more than " " random sexy cosplays : the movie " " "	1
did you just assume their gender ? <repeated>	1
because nolan movies are so smart , with complex themes and moral dilemmas	1
remember , yours is the only opinion thats correct .	1
well if you want to play that game than i can just say something stupid like superman is an alien with laser beam shooting eyes . how can we ever relate to that	1
mother or bitch ? what a satisfying range of options for a female star	1
but when would marvel get the rights back !	1
i did not realize the office was that old	1
but it does not praise the taliban , how can this be considered the best ?	1
facebook luthor was best luthor .	1
just another example of the media imposing impossible male body standards ! down with the matriarchy ! <repeated>	1
wow , really controversial picks you made there	1
how can that be ? i got so many down votes and was questioned regarding my claim that a 1 / 3 of trans women have <allcaps> hiv </allcaps> .	1
" did you just call every non - white in existence " " an animal " " ? "	1
the ant - man theme is fantastic . it ' s also written in 7 / 4 , a time signature that makes it somewhat of a standout among super hero themes . yup , marvel plays it safe .	1
but orc lives matter bro !	1
whom ? this never happened as far ad i am aware .	1
oh come on , this one is from unilad ! we have not heard their opinion !	1
yes , so many environmental activists in 1916	1
are you fucking stupid ? some gay novel over a motion picture ?	1
clearly you do not understand assholes are inevitable . it ' s everyone else ' s responsibility to deal with them	1
but it made a billion dollars !	1
cool , i can not wait for more updates !	1
yeah , that ' s what made the lost world so great !	1
no , atheists just have no moral compass or empathy !	1
you missed an	1
911 was an inside job .	1
those movies pale in the book - splitting department to the treasure that is the hobbit .	1
um , yeah . him and the other 100 + people that downvoted that nonsense are the problem , not you .	1
if he was a real american sniper , he would have been able to no scope .	1
the sequel to fool ' s gold ?	1
heck they could do an entire movie of just gopro river ride scenes !	1
uh . <repeated> * the shadow * ?	1
it permeates everything really . but there ' s no incentive for the system to change so full steam ahead ! <laugh>	1
but an airport is a great excuse . that ' s why civil war worked and bvs did not !	1
it ' s not an	1
so the third hokage ' s name literally means ninja warrior too ?	1
you did not like jesse eisenberg ?	1
oh , great ; another batman movie . can not wait .	1
gee , i wonder what happens . thanks trailer .	1
studio - apartment ? are not they like high rise towers ? we call them ' teeth '	1
i hear instead of dances with wolves , he is using the godfather saga as a template .	1
but that means you are saying ghostbusters had a good score !	1
i am sure , like all comedy sequels , this will be awesome .	1
well i only trust <allcaps> imdb </allcaps> , and this movie is a 4.3 so i will probably pass .	1
but do not you know that it needs to make a billion just to break even ?	1
<allcaps> excuse me but this movie is an underrated gem </allcaps>	1
oh look , a little creepy white girl with telekinesis . this surely will not be an uninspired re - skinning of every paranormal / haunting movie in recent years that only succeeds in reminding you how good ex machina was and how shitty it is .	1
nope , still a failure . this movie needed at least 4 trillion to break even ! <repeated> 1 !	1
audiences clearly hated wallace and grommet and the nightmare before christmas	1
yeah i mean there are going to be like six by the end of the year ! what a nightmare .	1
i think it ' s pretty apparent the patriarchy is alive and well in korea , and is suppressing this film under its boot heel . its failure has nothing to do with it being a steaming pile of shit .	1
wow , korea is really sexist !	1
was it on purpose ? i figured it was ad libbed and the editors forgot to take it out of the final cut .	1
inflation duh	1
wait . <repeated> are you telling me apple wasn ' t the only <allcaps> ibm </allcaps> competitor in the 8 0 s ?	1
yeah , fuck you for having an opinion ! <repeated>	1
like , venice beach ?	1
yes , every other religious themed movie is equal is measure , stature , and message to the passion of the christ . that ' s exactly what i am saying .	1
i am sure this is a pure grassroots campaign .	1
does it count if it is just mel gibson applauding ?	1
when she does press conference everyone is talking about her	1
<allcaps> a b </allcaps> movie with high budget , fairly famous actors for the time and huge box office takings , creating one of the most iconic cinema creatures of all time . sure sounds like a b movie	1
1979 *	1
we are the haters ?	1
alright , but what about your opinion on the raven ?	1
he ' s just so crazy and random ! <laugh>	1
man i have got to see forest bump , never heard of that one	1
for whom the bell tolls	1
really ? with award winning movies like suicide squad and ghostbusters ?	1
he was born to play marcellus wallace in pulp fiction . he just nailed that role . it was oscar - worthy . so good . just great .	1
do you really have to ask yourself that on reddit ? where have you been lately ? reddit obviously loves jennifer lawrence	1
is this a movie about the fashion industry ? models ? plastic people ?	1
<allcaps> til </allcaps> shooting movies is stressful	1
have you tried getting it in 4 k ?	1
oh no .	1
they should totally make a series of movies where it details how darth vader becomes darth vader . i bet you those movies would be very popular !	1
but but but it was critically panned on <allcaps> southpark </allcaps> . truest of all critics	1
but but mushrooms !	1
yeah goldeneye was terrible	1
pandering	1
do not sto thwith circlejerk man !	1
yeah , cause suicide squad was such a flop	1
yeah she ' s fucking ugly , is not she ?	1
no , anyone who takes part in the pc agenda is nothing but a cuck whose getting in the way of making america great again .	1
slut .	1
is this the prequel to the hateful eight ?	1
wow , you know they only did this because they did not have the guts to make it r - rated !	1
yeah , about that time i broke both my arms .	1
this is perfectly timed in light of ben - hur	1
hey man i will not have u besmirch the madea franchise like this she is an american icon	1
backdraft , cocoon , ransom , edtv , a beautiful mind , how the grinch stole christmas . yeah , ron do not know how to stylize a shot at all .	1
here , you dropped this :	1
remember to tag him in that thread as well ! let him run wild , and post a fifty page rant about how marvel deserved that flop ! fuck marvel ! kill all marvel fans !	1
damn , now i will never get my transformers <allcaps> tmnt </allcaps> crossover movie	1
* super <emphasis> * original post , op .	1
yeah , those rat bastards lecturing me on how the planet ' s important and shit . fuck the planet . jesus will give us a new one after judgment day , so i do not see why it ' s my problem .	1
dude , they used such innovative techniques like * reversing the film * and * holding their hands in front of the camera * . it wasn ' t incredibly obvious and distracting at all !	1
" these " " what disney characters would look like if : _____ " " are really getting out of hand . "	1
nah bro you do not get it , it ' s about them remaking a remake okay ? how dare they remake a remake , it ' s about the principle that remakes are bad .	1
so it can be a huge success like the recent ghostbusters movie	1
i guess j . j . abrams is too busy direction episode <allcaps> vi <elongated> </allcaps> , m : i 6 , and the next star trek movie .	1
well of course not ! that man said you were living under a rock .	1
what are you talking about , world war z is a cinematic masterpiece	1
' member when there were not so many blacks and mexicans in star wars ?	1
but zelda is a boy	1
imagine if someone actually built a massive surveillance system like the one in spectre .	1
it ' s the smog .	1
if they are not the stars , then who is ? anakin and luke ? <laugh>	1
what a sad day !	1
yeah that difference between 12 and 13 years is a real game changer .	1
* oh boy , i can barely wait for cars 3 ! <repeated> *	1
oh no what a tragic loss to the movie industry	1
as long as china has a ridiculous carbon footprint why should i do anything	1
wasn ' t it announced long before it ' d be similar to the original movie ? also fuck people for enjoying good acting , dialogue and effects right ? what a bunch of uncultured swine .	1
<allcaps> omg </allcaps> ! give him the nobel now !	1
" good days , back when movies were meant for kids and kids only , non of this " " let us make it entertaining for kids <allcaps> and </allcaps> adults " " bullshit . "	1
so it ' s not based on actual age just some alternate definition of young you prefer ?	1
dont you know its for the lolz bro	1
no man shame on you	1
camera man	1
of course we all know about it and do not deny history . the indians went wild and started kidnapping and raping white women and then they ran away . history 101 .	1
yeah i wish those lefties did not hate genocide so much ! <repeated>	1
because it won awards and stuff	1
yeah like luke cage . only black people watch that shit .	1
you can , but then it turns into a black sci - fi movie , which white people obviously will not watch , and that could not work .	1
lama pentecost ? what a silly name	1
damn , i was hoping we ' d finally get that haunted castle movie .	1
nah , that could never work . i mean , two black guys in sci - fi ? damn racist liberals trying to force white people out of movies . a black stormtooper was too much already !	1
yes , let us cast an asian actor to play the <allcaps> son </allcaps> of idris elba , a black actor	1
he ' s that guy who does a really good british accent right ?	1
" can not have our children catching " " the gay " " . "	1
yeah , denzel was freaking awesome in that movie !	1
maybe you are right . it is an astounding 0.4% increase .	1
whats that word ? cast ? cart ? wow , censorship really works .	1
hey everybody ! this guy has a differing opinion ! quickly , downvote him !	1
nono you are wrong , reddit is special <emphasis> you will not find any cancerous comments here !	1
their red line is child rapists . hollywood has zero tolerance for anyone who crosses that line .	1
rabble rabble rabble * * decapitating my childhood * * rabble rabble rabble	1
of course .	1
because disney making a movie i dont want to see is an insult to my superior intelligence .	1
i am like the only fucker on here that does not know who donald glover is . i came in to ask but yer all too busy being funny fuckers .	1
but he ' s suppose to be play miles morales guys !	1
its a wonder how we ever made it this far when disbelief starts ten years after a well known incident . but i mean we can all agree that the world trade center never existed . old films just cgi ' d that shit .	1
did he just kill that man - wow so out of character for superman - they have ruined him	1
yes , he looks and acts fairly close , only one problem , professor x is from new jersey .	1
i think it ' s tom cruise as jack reacher .	1
what ? you do not like random flashes of light and then connected flashes of light ?	1
ah yes , the comedic relief that this movie needs .	1
there is absolutely no way in hell that greece would give up the rights .	1
is this part of the marvel universe ?	1
no kenya scenes ? <repeated>	1
he ' s hypoglycemic . they just try to work into the shots .	1
yeah , sure cause hugh jackman and patrick stewart are known for their shotty acting	1
nah , weebverine was the best	1
i am surprised no one picked up on the last of us comparison ? i guess i should mention it	1
you can not just quote him . how is that fair ?	1
yes , because being horrified that he would murder white women and children in their sleep obviously means that we condone what the masters did .	1
yes , how dare a movie based on a comic book series be even remotely nerdy ! it should be nothing but tits , ass , and explosions !	1
and there probably still will not be any gamora or nebula toys because girl toys do not sell .	1
dammit marvel trying to be dark now	1
how totally unexpected	1
i am surprised that reviews do not mean shit .	1
oh cool , it ' s the carpet from sids house in toy story	1
really ? what ' s it about ?	1
they should cast jake gyllenhaal as altair .	1
same . good thing we are getting that detective pikachu movie !	1
meta	1
good thing we know this since leo ' s helming it , it will not get too preachy about environmentalism .	1
are you fucked . marvel has made great fucking characters like iron man and iron man and iron man and uhh , yeah , you dc fanatic .	1
oh good ; this will revive the shrek meme for at least another 5 years .	1
but but he does not look like dwayne johnson ! he is not muscular , hes fat ! look at him ! he does not even have an 8 - pack	1
probably just lossless	1
but we are gonna downvote the ones we do not agree with .	1
probably	1
yeah , that ' s what was wrong with it , too much whimsy <emphasis>	1
" " " but white washing . <repeated> " " "	1
<allcaps> will the whitewashing never stop </allcaps> ? ! <repeated>	1
well , this one is about a white guy fighting monsters . pretty authentic if you ask me .	1
palpatine is snoke confirmed ?	1
yeah . we watch movies right . others do it wrong	1
uh duh . the nazis were the national socialist <emphasis> party .	1
we all kinda laugh at posts like this but did not bates win one for a similar role in misery ? some day a fat white man will catch a break .	1
i mean how could he be alive at that point . <repeated> unless . <repeated> <allcaps> magic </allcaps> .	1
re looks physically challenged . crotch grab was so good	1
it will also include genetically modified dinosaurs , their reactions to humans and the modern world , and strong moral discussions on whether humans and dinosaurs are supposed to coexist in said modern world . also , are they safe ? can we monetize them ? these are the burning questions that will finally be addressed by this installment in the jurassic franchise .	1
his entire reputation was from slaughtering the younglings .	1
but star wars is for kids	1
he already has though , remember he viciously killed all those younglings	1
do not you dare talk smack about mr antilles	1
the imperial freedom star is the name the empire gave it before those bloody rebel terrorists basterdized it .	1
well if it worked for <allcaps> gta </allcaps> then it works for everything	1
therefore making you racist by association !	1
sorry .	1
some bullshit word they invented to take away all our pleasure .	1
we can also get more hatred of anyone who is not catholic . more specifically the jews . awesome !	1
to be fair , adults seem to be safe from him . so he ' s a rapist , sure , but he ' s a refined <emphasis> rapist .	1
because that ' s not gonna piss anyone off	1
i know , right ? i mean , it did not even have the rock in it . how can a film be any good if it does not have the rock in it ? ! <repeated>	1
lol	1
can not wait for the live - action remake !	1
hmm , <allcaps> til </allcaps>	1
2013 , no ?	1
yes , pushing a false narrative about men at the expense of intellectual honesty is so much better .	1
especially <emphasis> , mars attacks .	1
but nothing can beat wilhelm ' s ? ! <repeated>	1
" it would have made the domestic audience confused . that idea wasn ' t realized in the final " " american cut " " of the film . "	1
wasn ' t that cloverfield ?	1
spoilers ! <repeated> jeez	1
or like lighting a homeless person on fire	1
power rangers being cheesy and anime inspired ? what has the world come to ?	1
that ' s racist	1
wow way to spoil the entire movie	1
i knew that	1
aladdin and the lion king are such hot garbage .	1
there seems quite a high post volume for this movie , but pretty much zero buzz . i wonder why ?	1
oh wow ! <allcaps> pkd </allcaps> came back to life a wrote a new story . sweet . can not wait to read it .	1
i personally can not wait for the candy crush saga movie . we all know it ' s gonna be absolutely riveting .	1
hi there , first of all i just want to say i absolutely love your work , secondly . <repeated> will thor ragnarok follow the comics or ? . <repeated>	1
wow i wonder who ' s going to win .	1
yeah , there are only like 3 comic story arcs about him right ?	1
yeah , i can totally see where * the batman * title missed its mark .	1
yeah that is going to break down the box office doors .	1
as someone named logan , i can not <allcaps> wait </allcaps> for all the jokes i am gonna receive .	1
egyptians were black !	1
even better than the new transformers movie ?	1
<allcaps> dae </allcaps> think scenes should never be removed ? once its written by the truly visionary director nobody else should even be involved in the process .	1
yeah , the fact that he had just previously beaten the most feared fighter on the planet is irrelevant .	1
hmm . <repeated> i am surprised no one has mentioned that kid ' s long fingers yet .	1
lol reminds of the time i was eating cereal only to realize after , 2 hours , that the bowl was empty and i was eating nothing . yea i am that dumb that i do not notice such simple things .	1
by the same website that gave such masterpieces like warcraft and suicide squad rotten ratings .	1
i actually hated spongebob because he wasnt a white man so i could not identify with him . like data in the ghoonies , i liked that he had gadgets and liked james bond but him being asian completely stopped me from identifying with him	1
are you saying you <allcaps> don </allcaps> ' t want 3 1 / 2 minutes of mrs wayne ' s blood spattered pearls dropping to the noirish , slightly damp and dreary streets of gotham , to you know , invoke the angst and anguish that follows batman for the rest of his life ?	1
it ' s funny because he talks slow and sounds retarded .	1
there are no opinions only facts and mr plinketts opinions are facts	1
was it because your name wasn ' t in it or get mentioned ?	1
by the time the review of revenge of the sith came out , it was pretty clear red letter media did not want to just do another plot hole nitpick type of deal ( unlike their star trek movie series reviews ) . mike and the crew are the type of guys who would rather have some meaning to their videos than be fraudulent hacks ( or maybe they were always hack frauds ) . point being the review does not start until 56 minutes in , but this video essay was obviously going to criticize the meta of star wars rather than just nitpick jj abrams and how he plays it safe ( see the new star trek move reviews ) . i was frankly surprised they would even do a plinkett on this movie since i thought they wrapped up sith pretty well . but nope they are just all internet phony hypocrites	1
because he ' s a young up and comer who still needs to prove himself	1
i heard they did the same but with an entire movie when it came to star wars <allcaps> vii </allcaps> .	1
well , corporations are people , so they should be able to run for office	1
but evidence suggests you ' d love transmorphers !	1
krzysztof kieslowski too .	1
i heard that they were going to super - impose the characters from rogue one into the original trilogy and release that as a new special edition bluray .	1
glad i could help .	1
there goes * rogue two * , i guess	1
especially considering they torture and kill a car in that flick . great kids movie !	1
sorry , not impressive . it has to be 300 million dollar picture .	1
he will alway be red forman to me	1
then it ' s pretty incomprehensible whining to 99.999% of the world to complain about being paid more for less work . shocking that she did not get more traction	1
but it ' s entertainment <emphasis> weekly ! <repeated> how could it not ? <repeated>	1
sarcasm . i guess you people do not understand that . i even put the fucking	1
rita is <allcaps> mcu </allcaps> villain confirmed . the rangers have no chance agaisnt that infinity stone !	1
yeah . <repeated> this is so definitely worse than colorful rainbow spandex with plastic helmets that came out of a dollar store .	1
bulk and skull are the guildenstern and rosencrantz of our generation . how dare you defy it by calling it silly ! <repeated>	1
* but i am normal and i suck at math ! *	1
she has that slight , upturned smile that i associate with rita repulsa . i can see she is going to nail this character .	1
that can not be it , it has to be a marketing conspiracy , that ' s the only feasible option .	1
yeah , sure , cumberbatch ' s only fans are horny women . he can not possibly be popular because he ' s a good actor or anything . he can not possibly attract audiences made of men , lgbt individuals , or women who think he ' s weird looking but talented .	1
obviously	1
he did not live in a 1 4 th century european tower so it ' s basically just asian religious mumbo jumbo	1
how could you not love legolas entering god mode ?	1
they look so much alike though ! <repeated>	1
i dunno they had a fake croc they used in octopussy which had james bond in .	1
oh <elongated> no <elongated> you ruined the matrix	1
i am truly sorry you missed out on getting that experience . you should tell your friend snape kills dumbledore	1
yeah cobber do not debate this crikey with me otherwsie i am going to have to shove my foot up your coit for being a cheeky wanke	1
great article !	1
yeah . all those musicians who have not become rock stars are just completely miserable people with no joys in life .	1
it does not look at all fake .	1
" i am assuming they decided against " " in space , no one can hear you run . " " "	1
<allcaps> oh god a western </allcaps> ? ! <repeated> wtf is disney ' s problem they are ruining sw this is a such a fucking money grab it ' s just like bttf3 quit milking our beloved franchise !	1
why couldnt they get asian actors to play those white roles hmm <elongated> ? <repeated> <hashtag> boycott hollywood </hashtag> <hashtag> whitewash </hashtag>	1
yeah , and the clinton foundation is a charity that helps countries like haiti .	1
plus there ' s asians in it . must be kurosawa right ?	1
you might as well get rid of the star wars title too	1
why ? we just witnessed this in real time a mere 15 years ago	1
sweet . they are actually using real asians for the asian roles .	1
oh we are posting short films here now ? i like that it ' s shot on iphone but there ' s an old movie filter on it .	1
the fun is over kid .	1
racists	1
this is why trump won	1
can confirm	1
human eye can only see 2 0 fps !	1
yes . thank god , finally . fuck him and his job .	1
nope . they are not allowed . there ' s a hollywood movie being produced , which means it ' s mainstream now and we have to act as gatekeepers to keep the hoi polloi out of the holy of holies .	1
wow i clearly wasn ' t being serious , guess i should have put	1
yeah because the classic hollywood did not have any kind of censorship . <repeated> and did not make any masterpiece with soft and no belligerent movies .	1
" honestly , this scares me a bit as i have heard rumblings of a couple smaller chains emulating <allcaps> amc </allcaps> . " " what ? they can charge for their loyalty program ? let us do that too ! they charge more for blockbusters ? hm . <repeated> let us give that a go ! if we act like a big chain , people will love us more , right ? " " "	1
concerns about her acting ability , but the rock can just keep pumping films out . makes sense	1
never saw that coming	1
ok , then this scene actually sucks .	1
this might just be me , but i do not think she looks anything like han	1
yeah she really saved the last terminator movie	1
but as long as its not shaky its automatically a good fight scene	1
its a weapon , someone call police and use lethal force !	1
yeah , if only they had been tougher they would have won the vietnam war when they got older .	1
yeah it ' s totally unfair to compare a batman movie ' s box office to the box office of the last batman movie .	1
the ass of jj	1
so , we are not supposed to use stewardess or actress but huntress is ok ?	1
i too am a fan of fiction	1
i love paying exorbitant prices	1
yeah , just like a minstrel show !	1
nonesense ! only goodfellas ! it ' s the greatest movie ever ! <repeated>	1
a video game movie stuck in development hell . that ' s never happened before .	1
oh boy , another king kong movie .	1
pfft <elongated> , large robots ? grow up ! these movies are supposed to be realistic , do not bring this nonsense in a nonfiction .	1
especially marion cotillard on his death scene	1
but bro the expanded universe and comics make it even better and you should have read up on them before watching .	1
so you guys are saying i should <emphasis> watch 2001 , right ?	1
this will be great , just like the live - action movie adaptation of one of my other animated favorites , * avatar , the last airbender * !	1
i am so tired of japan asian - washing white characters	1
found the sexist	1
the kingsman	1
i forgot that musicians can not have variety	1
i am shocked	1
really ? a horse chase scene right off the bat followed by jets zooming across the sky ? it ' s totally the action flic of the year .	1
suicide squad was excellent - people who did not like that or bvs just do not understand how much of a visionairy zach snyder is .	1
i hear it ' s coming up on it ' s 5 3 rd anniversary , who knew !	1
john wick	1
no nipples ? this movie sucks .	1
you are telling me turning lincoln into a vampire killer is not unique ? ! <repeated>	1
losing your miranda rights out of lawful exception for public safety is totally <emphasis> comparable to eliciting a confession out of duress by beating someone , right ?	1
yeah , fuck magic and wonderment .	1
oh dope , the glee cover !	1
yea man cartoons are for kids .	1
because world history is not good enough source material	1
k - pop fans are definitely up there . plenty of people i know like k - pop , and the worst part is they are fans just because they think the celebrities look good . but hey , it ' s not an obsession because they are real people .	1
but shakespeare in love was far better than saving private ryan ! <repeated>	1
because he wants to see some beav goddamnit .	1
it ' s almost like he is mentally ill .	1
looks like they ripped of the matrix	1
the one with more bloom . bloom makes every better !	1
finally , i have been wondering about exactly this question !	1
there should be a criterion collection release of this movie . it ' s a work of art that needs to be preserved along with classics like armageddon <emphasis> and * the rock * . supplements must include interviews with the cast and director , a booklet with a q & a with kevin spacey , and audio commentary by christopher walken . get on it , criterion !	1
what , natasha flirting with a dork like banner is not human enough for you ?	1
as it turns out class is a doctor who spin - off that i totally need that cause all those kids in dr who were so endearing .	1
age to addresses , very logical leap in topic .	1
not like that information is not anywhere else on the internet or anything right ?	1
idk why people do not believe somebody <allcaps> other than the poster </allcaps> could compliment the poster . like , maybe it ' s this crazy thing where one person likes what another has to say , and then voices this opinion ? but real people do not do that .	1
yeah dane dehaan definitely looks too old to play valerian	1
oh wow cara again . show ' s they care so much about the film and not just another cash cow .	1
is this movie like the 5 th element ?	1
but do not you know ? trump is going to start rounding up and gassing the mexicans , gays and muslims .	1
i am sure that 1 - 2 degree difference in 50 years will be the death of us all and humanity wont be able to use technology to cope	1
no , it was the media	1
well yeah its because he is a knee grow	1
hopefully they explore spiderman ' s origin and high school life . we need at least one film of that before we die .	1
yeah , that ' s definitely his fault .	1
the one with that indian star that got its visa denied	1
you are completely wrong . this is president trump ' s first act of racism and discrimination	1
he could be the poisoned skittle .	1
in the <allcaps> usa </allcaps> , we call that the <allcaps> fcc </allcaps> .	1
how can she be tired if she does not make any effort in acting ?	1
socialism is great , we should totally lean that direction	1
" this is a great idea ! who can can argue with " " excellent more integrity " " decided by the government ? "	1
do not forget amy shumer !	1
they probably listened to korn on set and figured they would get all nu metal fans in on the movie	1
white washing by a chinese director in a chinese studio about a european traveler assisting the chinese in their war against dragon deities . why could not it be a chinese european traveler ? racism that ' s why !	1
they made hermione black in the broadway production , why not dumbledore as well .	1
they made hermione black in the broadway production , why not dumbledore as well .	1
yet you took the time to click on the link and write a comment . you definitely do not care	1
but he died !	1
he definitely deserves the benefit of the doubt .	1
* the fifth wave * was clearly the frontrunner before this .	1
oh no , the circle jerk is not amused . <repeated> all these downvotes , i can not take it .	1
i love trailers for trailers .	1
" i am not racist ! i spent 3 / 4 of that paragraph saying " " i am not racist , but " " ! "	1
but it ' s not the death star . it ' s 4 x bigger !	1
go away fun police .	1
yay movie trailers ! thanks for all of those in - depth selling points !	1
i am tired of all those damn mexicans pulling the operation wetback card and those indiand pulling the trail of tears card . go back to your country if you do not like it	1
i down voted it because it triggered me , not because it wasn ' t funny .	1
snyder ' s just getting his money ' s worth after licensing zepplin for the sucker punch trailer .	1
nope you are just a marvel fanboy .	1
yeah that ' s never been done in a movie before .	1
you are not forced <emphasis> to do anything . sign the contract if you are happy , otherwise do not . and yeah , you have the right to criticize whatever you want , but your position to wax self - righteously indignant about it later is much reduced . <repeated> or at least it would be if half the crusaders in here understood the concept of agency . but who says self - victimization has to make sense , right ?	1
because having hope a movie is going to be good is totally comparable to denying cientific facts .	1
because , as we all know , all german films are basically unwatchable .	1
nah , what would a god of war be doing in a war to end all wars ?	1
eww dc sorry i am only a marvel turd	1
finn from star wars	1

hey bro , what ' s up ?	1
hey white people : be sure to make amends for the things that some other white people that you are not even related to did many generations ago . i do not care if your family immigrated to the us one or two generations back . all white people worldwide are guilty of the things that any white person did ever .	1
can not watch it and get into heaven son , that ' s stealing <sad>	1
what ? the ending is pure disney .	1
yeah , i am sure batman or superman are not good stories at all . that ' s why they must be so unpopular and have not resonated with our culture for decades right ?	1
thats fair , star wars has always been know for top notch writing	1
he does not die in the movie ? come on ! spoilers man ! <repeated>	1
so what you are saying is . <repeated> disney orchestrated her cardiac arrest so they could profit $50 million ?	1
they cast british actors for a series that takes place entirely in britain ? <allcaps> how absurd </allcaps> .	1
ugh the movie was ruined because i saw johnny depp for 5 seconds ! <repeated> 1 / 10 stars horrible show	1
mike myers could have pulled off a convincing mad eye	1
that ' s pretty xenophobic	1
<allcaps> til </allcaps> monty python isnt a huge influence on any american comedian ever	1
aww , i was so pumped for john wayne v bruce lee .	1
we do not take a liking to those people putting out quality compelling work	1
yeah all the male actors who have sexually assaulted someone are blacklisted forever	1
thankfully , his inclusion as is was completely necessary to the plot of the movie , and not at all fan service .	1
yeah . disney hates money .	1
" i think you mean . <repeated> ( checks imdb ) . <repeated> okay , what the hell is a " " fonz " " ? can you eat it ? "	1
but , streaming and piracy is killing the film industry	1
because it dampens inertia , duh !	1
that ' s not how hearing works .	1
thanks * 2016 <emphasis> * !	1
yes , genius idea . they should also recruit their own stormtroopers from birth to make sure they have the numbers to compete .	1
i mean , have they even seen the prestige ?	1
great , now i remember that open season 2 and 3 existed . thanks for that .	1
you are right , 9 0 s kids do !	1
you watch your tone young man . that movie is maybe the <allcaps> goat </allcaps> .	1
but <elongated> what about the wage gap ? ! <repeated>	1
you think they will destroy a bigger death star and episode nine will see the biggest death star ever destroyed ? the bad guys quit cause the spent all their money .	1
she could be on the list for highest grossing asian actors soon .	1
especially the weird kid orgy near the end	1
it ' s definitely a sign of real good person you are right	1
dump star wars was a success guys	1
what , you mean some people may actually care about the death of one of the most highly loved movie actresses of all time ? of course not , they are just pretending for karma !	1
she looked so healthy in rogue one though . <repeated>	1
just remember that the emoji movie is going to be a thing in 2017 .	1
yeah , he was great on girls .	1

dismal , dank , depressing but of course edgy because rebels . why did not the box office flock to it ?	1
" not if they do an all - women reboot though . then it ' s just " " unnecessary " " . "	1
hey man , i came to the comments so that i did not have to read the article , ok ?	1
wow i can not possibly see any parallels to real life there	1
good it ' s 2016 , you should not be assuming genders	1
i really hate this movie , the kranks are bad people i guess for wanting to spend their first christmas without their daughter by doing something for themselves ? what monsters	1
wow , it ' s so weird that different places have different traditions and such . i too assumed everyone was exactly the same .	1
nah , he ' s already gonna play detective pikachu , you can not steal him from us	1
wow dude , jewish people are allowed to enjoy christmas too , stop discriminating	1
i am offended that only one is male .	1
and all of them are white ? wow what a fucking racist .	1

you sexist ! <repeated>	1
i can now sleep easier knowing the core players of this utter classic are returning to provide us another round of unforgettable entertainment .	1
can not wait for tomorrow ' s picture !	1
no spoilers tag ?	1
i mean maybe but then where would we get our sense of superiority from ?	1
damn , just because she ' s killed of in episode 8 does not mean disney have to kill her in real life	1
fallout boy cover .	1
oh yeah , the things you do when you are younger never effect you when you get older . never , not ever . i mean , who would ever think that ? and for the record	1
bullshit , deadpool was such an underrated gem	1
i think everyone here is a bot . named k - 2 so .	1
it ' s possible , i mean , they are charismatic .	1
anyone who does not take the immediate aftermath of a tragedy as an opportunity to show off their finesse at writing puns is surely just a stuck - up jerk , yup	1
there is passion in both , people in both , death in both . <repeated> honestly i do not see the problem	1
careful now - you might offend transwomen .	1
and she drinks like 20 cokes a day so that helps .	1
dude he ' s just anti smoking ?	1
what about the kid who wasn ' t breathing for 40 minutes np ?	1
because sources like <allcaps> bbc </allcaps> news , hollywood reporter , etc clearly are not reliable to the mods .	1
this movie is more deceptive than collateral beauty smh	1
because she ' s a frail little girl and men are pigs .	1
because you are supposed to watch the movies ! not think about them !	1
next you are gonna tell me jingle all the way is overrated .	1
yeah this looks really edgy and compelling	1
wow im so fucking excited for super hero movie <hashtag> 375 </hashtag> . i bet it ' s going to be nothing like the previous 374 we have seen .	1
looks like snyderverse is finally gonna ditch that dumb rope and giver her a sword like marston always intended !	1
yeah . that approach has been working great <emphasis> for dc so far .	1

this is america , idiots with a twitter soapbox have gone as far as the presidency	1
interneter coming through to white knight a man ' s earring . i just got put in my place !	1
this is one of the reasons i hated captain america . like how can he jump so high and punch so many people . its such bullshit .	1

so 2 companies out of the 10 that control all media . really sounds like the conservatives are taking over	1
like all the white movies with an all white cast . they are contribution to the white side of the equation .	1
i like the fact that they are so sure of themselves and this movie .	1
affirmative action promotion , promote a white guy , gotta promote a black guy .	1
what are you talking about ? kids these days love the emojies	1

b - but it ' s totally anime ! it has asian inspired settings and characters and the brand of comedy and action mixed is literally anime ! does not matter that what we refer to as anime is japanese animated works !	1
yeah . thanks reagan .	1
loki ! no , do not quit !	1
racism only works one way	1
obviously they need white people to be offended on their behalf , since minorities are incapable of such social insight	1
it amazes me how we can go from discussing fictional western cartoon characters to an analysis of the psychological impact of the nuclear bombs on japanese masculinity . good job , internet .	1
yes , peter jackson , the man that fought tooth - and - nail to get the <allcaps> lotr </allcaps> movies made in the first place , had to be forcibly stopped from deliberately ruining them .	1

yeah , but denzel is black . the oscars like to piss off black people	1
avoid history books too	1
what exactly would it spoil ? the narrative of over 300,000 european troops being evacuated from dunkirk during ww2 ? because thats a historical event i have never heard of .	1
have not seen that font before .	1
i think you mean the kurosawa of the movie	1

oh great a movie about how shit men are ( chevalier ) . i can not watch that fast enough .	1
i wonder if it has to do with their demographics	1
yeah , persecuting your own countrymen sure shows those imperialists .	1
probably because of the second game	1
short film , where he drowns instantly ?	1
that new show westwood been hearing good things about it ? that any good ?	1
superhero movies are flicks though , except for <allcaps> bvs </allcaps> and watchmen	1
amazing !	1
huh , arent communists supposed to be atheist and above the superstitions the bourgeoisie use to keep them down ? perhaps some of the <allcaps> prc </allcaps> leadership need to be reeducated about the superiority of the marxist doctrine and how it is scientifically proven to eventually replace all imperialist ideology .	1
it ' s the liberal ape agenda at it again !	1
nah , you are probably a shill	1
no way , nobody in reddit thinks differently from me ! we are legion !	1

<allcaps> omg </allcaps> he ' s so classy !	1
holy shit they should not be allowed to speak or be seen in public . people that think differently than i do should be shunned .	1
yeah , stupid critics ! only big movies people have heard of are any good	1
and a transexual person ?	1
but the jews control the media and all of these humans from different planets in a vast galaxy far far away look different . why can not they all be white , the one acceptable black guy per generation , or aliens ?	1
i mean i obviously wish more too . it ' s just frustrating that issues of women or other non - white groups being relegated to shitty stereotypes or terrible characters be brushed away often on this site but god forbid they make a comedy about nerds . <repeated> and that is a true struggle	1
how about leslie jones ?	1
oh my god i cannot wait , how am i going to make it another 24 hours without the baywatch trailer ? <repeated>	1
and if you cut out the staircase fight scene , orgy and dance number it ' s a breezy 38 minutes .	1

i am sure it will show gamers in a great light	1
fuck hollywood . it ' s called ocean ' s eight because they are already planning two sequels ( ocean ' s 9 & 10 ) . clever !	1
no thanks - i will make my top 10 list however i damn well choose .	1
" because men are the women ' s opressor , all men are evil . you should read lena dunham ' s new book " " how to shut down a mansplainer ( by kicking him in the balls ) " " really enlightening stuff according to all the reviews . "	1
but it ' s star wars	1
his personality is also a boomerang	1
but that would require actual parenting <emphasis> ! things like this is what censorship is for !	1
yep , plenty of people backing down and forfeiting at pro level tournaments	1
but he ' s made <allcaps> amazing </allcaps> movies since then !	1
well , that ' s another book i do not have to read .	1
actual discussion about the movie ? you can not do that here ! fall in line and make sure everyone knows that you hate these films !	1
yeah well , jokes on you , now she ' s a big hollywood actress highly in demand	1

hue hue <allcaps> drumpf </allcaps> iz lol amirite ?	1
yeah . i have seen all of these movies . was expecting a better list .	1
dammit man , now they will be dismantling the eiffel tower !	1
the jennifer lawrence mystique school of super powered beings . how can you appreciate how pretty the actress is if you keep her in makeup for most of the movie ?	1
not when government contractors are involved	1
the mummy seemed to really jumpstart the rocks career . so this will probably be good for cruise .	1
i do not think directing star wars is really a good metric for success .	1
naw man , nobody watches them . they are just making them for the fuck of it .	1
" what ' s this " " stargate universe " " that you are referring to ? "	1
wow . great . this world needs more super hero movies .	1
jane got a gun	1

interstellar , inception , the dark knight , the prestige , memento . <repeated> yeah , nobody knows who this nolan guy is .	1
bane in batman & robin was the best bane	1
yay <elongated> ! i love it when hollywood comes up with remakes instead of original ideas . they never make remakes of classic movies and possibly ruin it !	1
all star wars has to be totally subversive like episode 5	1
ugh , when will fatigue set in ?	1

i do not think they will kill han solo twice , so you are probably safe	1
16 seconds . oh universal , you do spoil us .	1
enchantress got a fashion upgrade , sweet	1
the original mummy is supposed to be a man . another feminist hollywood remake	1
i hope there ' s a sentient computer with the consciousness of a dead nazi involved in our current political climate somewhere	1

i want to be a professional porn critic and researcher , where is my adequate pay . i believe that my work is very important .	1
because this totally worked with ghost busters . <repeated> why would not this work too ?	1
let us just remake all movies with an all female cast . surely that ' ll please the feminist demographic that accounts for much of the film industry ' s revenue .	1
oh good , another all female reboot of a popular film . can not wait for this one .	1
and josh trank only directed chronicle before the amazing fantastic four	1
can not wait to hear about how this movie tarnishes the great name of the oceans trilogy .	1
oh yeah we have a real shortage of shit - pinchers in this town these days	1

wow that sounds lovely , a true testament to how great these places are .	1
getting downvoted , but no rebuttals . is not r / politics fun ?	1
trump is doing just that .	1
the current year has struck again !	1
i personally preferred joel schumaker ' s campy batman .	1
it ' s barbaric and hostile that you would insinuate an entire country you know nothing about is barbaric and hostile . perhaps their government is hostile ( still not barbaric ) but that does not take into consideration that we are more hostile because we want their resources . if anything is a black mark on the states it ' s the constant doubling down on asshole logic . defend that asinine position to your death !	1
exactly , hollywood elitist types not attending their own awards ceremony to stick it to trump ? that will really show him .	1
we have done huge atrocities in the past so it ' s totally okay for us to do less horrible things now .	1
lol you are good at this trolling thing	1
so kind of like how muslim religion thinks towards people who do not accept their religion ?	1
well yes everyone knows freedom of speech means that you can say what you want and everyone * * has <emphasis> * * to listen	1

steve jobs	1
i will have you know that i took psych 101 so i am pretty damn qualified to analyze him thanks lmao	1
yeah , antifa are 100% also about genocide . that ' s like , their thing . if they got to power , they would totally also exterminate the races they see as inferior .	1
yah casey violence is okay as long as it supports your political beliefs	1
and that ' s why the holocaust was okay , because it was legal .	1

well black people are not as good as white people , so when they manage to win it ' s something special . <happy>	1
because asians and latinos were not brought over in slave ships from africa	1
i guess the oscars are not racist this year . let us see if they are racist next year .	1
black lives matter	1
how sad is it that she ' s the first to win three nominations , and there ' s been generations of actors with multiple oscar wins in their family tree . yeah , racism is over guys !	1
she is practically jenna maroney !	1
thanks trump , you say you will make america great again but now we have coloreds in our oscars	1
if she were <allcaps> truly </allcaps> great she would have been in deadpool and not complained about trump	1
well technically she can not be snubbed if she ' s not even nominated	1
" the one white person in the movie is portrayed by a man with the last name " " freeman " " . marvel racist confirmed . "	1
where is sausage party ?	1

fuck me , i want some of that gold .	1
yes . you are correct that the validity ( read : w * * eigh <emphasis> * * t ) of an argument has no bearing in a court of law .	1
remember when they were credible , back when they nominated films like the shining	1
spoiler alert , fuck .	1
but the only people who did not like ghostbusters were men who hate women . there is literally nothing wrong with that film .	1
we are including spoilers in the title by default now are we ?	1
get out of here with your technically correct deep eu lore	1
how dare they insult poor ben affleck with a nomination . let us all rush to defend his honor and denounce the razzies	1
oh boy	1
is not across the universe considered made by the beatles ?	1
yeah but empire strikes back wasn ' t about blowing up a planet destroyer . so the only way for this film to not <emphasis> be an empire strikes back rehash is to , again <emphasis> , make it about blowing up another <emphasis> planet destroyer .	1
are they going to destroy another death star ?	1
if i have learned anything the past couple of years it ' s that everyone is defined by their skin , their gender , their sexuality , and their religion .	1
pirates have totally destroyed the movie business	1

yeah you are right , we have already gone too far so we should just give up now	1
yeah , cause fuck human decency amirite	1
well , with all these vaccines causing autism , maybe the kid knows what ' s good for it more than you do .	1
they could not give the black suit to the black guy like in the original series because that would be racism	1
shut up <allcaps> nerd </allcaps> !	1
at least it started later than 2016 did . bowie died on the 1 0 th , while he died on the 1 9 th .	1
damn marvel shills expecting a decent , coherent movie , amirite ?	1
yep , total rip off . the giant goldar and mechs and suits just show how similar this is to chronicle .	1
well if the producer said so it must be true .	1
ooh look at you , i will have you know that i only cried 3 times while watching hachiko <emphasis> , so , hah !	1
has this person never watched sucker punch or love actually ? apparently not . though it ' s not really fair to compare the two best films of this century and pit them against last of us . let me just say sucker punch and love actually are the best films hollywood has to offer and are indicative of the overall quality storytelling we can expect in the future .	1
nothing on earth is <emphasis> cooler than white power .	1
hilarious ! <repeated>	1
but he said average <emphasis> redditor .	1

they are all dangerous war criminals and must be brought to justice !	1
english only , this is usa , do not you dare bring a movie here without our language being used	1
it ' ll make sense when she ' s treated badly by germans for being asian	1
totally . remember when joaquin phoenix was unable to adjust his ( non professional ) singing style to imitate johnny cash ? johnny cash definitely does not have a distinct voice .	1
clearly ! since it didnt make 2 billion !	1
so what you are saying is women are actually paid too much ?	1
i bet lily rose depp was paid 3 times more because she ' s a star ' s daughter .	1
hmm , i always find people who comment in all capital letters to be very convincing	1

" " " 50% explosions and 50% low angles on bikini clad women " " - exactly what a bond film should be , right ? "	1
it ' s so great that someone finally made a movie set in la . so , so underrepresented .	1

i will look some up , thanks for the tip ! i went to school for film so that basically makes me an expert anyway .	1
thanks no one knew that	1
yes , you are right . discrimination is always the fault of the victims .	1
because girls are only allowed to play with princess dolls obviously	1
so , if you have two actors who share top billing , but the movie is marketed at a certain demographic , you should pay the one that attract that demographic less the least amount of money ? sure , that sounds reasonable .	1
just like those fucking huguenots ! asshole religious minorities taking all the good jobs that proper ( insert group ) deserves !	1

i am not a pro at all but i have played on stage before . i can only imagine that in that kind of environment that a stage without monitors ( the speakers that project sound back towards the stage performers ) it would sound like nothing was happening at all . i kind of feel bad for her . i mean as much as i can - she ' s physically stunning , has an incredible range , has universally loved music , and more money than i can imagine . wait , why did she survive 2016 !	1
yeah she ' s only one of the most popular actors in the largest films of all time they should not give the family anything tbh	1
that ' s so stupid that it has to be true !	1
because daytime is for good christian families with wholesome values while nighttime is for the . <repeated> * gays <elongated> *	1
doc savage eventually got superpowers . i guess indy drinking the holy grail water that healed him had a permanent effect , given what he survives in the fourth movie , so maybe he did too .	1

no way man cause you can not be racist against whites	1
of course not . do not you see his bombardier blue eyes ?	1
hmm <elongated> wonder if i need to watch the first 5 to understand the plot ?	1
you saw how successful marvel was with changing characters races , genders , and sexual orientations .	1
got me , yes his name is pewdiepie .	1
yeah , i love quality films like * cars 2 * .	1
cynt ? wow , i didnt know we carrey fans knew sych language .	1
of course the top - voted comment is a reference to chinatown . fucking r / movies and it ' s superhero movie obsession .	1
oh yay , another reboot that no one is asking for !	1
" at work , when someone makes a big mistake that ' s gonna cost the company some money , we say " " someone really nolan ' ed it up . " " when the same person tries to fix the mistake and makes the problem worse , naturally we say it an " " inception " " . christopher will be a punchline in hollywood the same way anthony weiner is in politics . "	1
. <repeated> just look up his home address on google and give him a visit . wait until nightfall though , and do not use the front entrance .	1
one multiple ! as opposed to many multiples ! learn to read !	1
i was thinking overboard <emphasis> but i guess you have a point	1
i know . like , how dare doctors who have 8 + years of training before practicing medicine make determinations based on science instead of someones feelings .	1
that ' s boring and slow	1
i dunno , shower death by pubic mutilation seemed pg - 13 ' ish to me .	1
but not may the 4 th because people have too many other plans and wont be thinking about star wars at all	1
total missed opportunity for the release on may the fourth . i am so disappointed . get your shit together disney	1
you mean indiana jones 4 right ?	1
oh totally i mean there was no way my elementary school mind would seperate me from the over the top villains and kill the message .	1
ah <elongated> yes , gamesradar . what an amazing source for film news .	1
but season 4 was so well thought - out and cleverly constructed !	1
<allcaps> um <elongated> </allcaps> ? <repeated> that ' s because amber whored was lying and now she ' s going to steal tesla from elon musk	1
whelp , looks like i am moving to la to be a scab .	1
yeah my girlfriend likes to rate the dying soldiers on omaha beach in saving private ryan	1
but the punisher show is not out yet !	1
hahah that would be absolutely hilarious <allcaps> omg </allcaps>	1
someone stating their opinion about the <allcaps> movie </allcaps> the post is about ? in r / movies ? ! <repeated> how dare they !	1
oh , so sorry i negatively affected your imaginary internet points	1
nah , it does not ring a bell	1
or you give filmmakers the freedom to make the movie they want ? which is what ? what james gunn did ? oh wow . what a surprise that the film ended up good .	1
retards	1
" what is the " " disagree " " button for then ? "	1
we just make assumptions of films based on other peoples opinions and roll with that	1
idk 1000 is a lot . and obviously we are talking about english - language movies after about 1970	1
^^^ this guy definitely does not work for the actor ' s pr firm .	1
america as a country does not really count because it ' s quite big and they would never have been one if it were not for french money / military	1
yeah , something like that	1
bro ! do not think it , do not say it !	1
not even color ?	1
yay	1
that ' s not jurassic world 2 , that ' s ancient futures !	1
that ' s what you get for watching <allcaps> sao </allcaps> .	1
yeah that ' s why it got nominated for best picture and won a bunch of oscars , because no one thought it was good	1
totally shocked that you have no response	1
cause these movies are so packed with good ideas , tight writing , and engaging dialogue that it ' s just impossible to squeeze these into the film proper .	1
yea . because black people are born jazz fans and it ' s in their nature to be jazz purists . how absurd .	1
well that trailer spoiled the entire movie , gave away everything .	1
ah yes , those marvel cheaters making enjoyable , solid movies ! how dare they have a coherent storyline and good characters !	1
there you go not global	1
having the review embargo lift after the movie is out in several regions is also a good sign .	1
then china has to be racist as hell just like this sub said 2 years ago !	1
right , cause i am sure the plot is really what drives people to see the films	1
yeah , because whedon has a long history of helpless women in his projects .	1
im so glad i know this going into the second movie	1
brainiac . they will try to make him the james spader ( ultron ) of dc .	1
yeah dude , america has such better taste than the rest of the world	1
oh man , that ' s way <elongated> too edgy for the likes of me ! damn , that would be too thought provoking and offensive to my sensibilities .	1
trade routes can be pretty <emphasis> interesting . every 1 2 yo i know loves to learn about them !	1
vince vaughn was also tied and raped in wedding crashers . man that was hilarious <emphasis>	1
fake star war !	1
" i hate this as well , and try to skip it . especially like last season , pretty sure one of the " " previously on got " " intros showed the red wedding or the one story . made the pie thing such a surprise "	1
underrated	1
wow , you really take your phone out while everyone around you is trying to enjoy the trailers ? asshole .	1
james bond films ? roger moore was supposed to be james bond in those movies ?	1
dude , get over yourself . it ' s 2017 .	1
2 4 fps literally unwatchable	1
just turn your brain off and they are a blast !	1
24 <allcaps> fps </allcaps> smh is this a movie for a peasant console	1
i dunno , man , i am a lot more frightened of clowns than i am of nothing .	1
if there is not an 11 year old gangbang it is not true to form	1
woah ! cool explosions and shit ! woah ! i am so excited ! i am a manchild !	1
all of which lead to the fucking prequels . take your fancy quotin ' and be off before you jinx the good movies .	1
actually , this time it will be built on an actual star instead of being a space station or built into a planet . gotta go bigger !	1
you just can not see them .	1
only 52 ? hopefully they are at least 45 minutes each , amateur .	1
nuance in my star wars characters ? get the fuck outta here !	1
that ' s okay . 15 - 20 minutes is all it takes for a normal person to fall in love with an animal too .	1
whaat ? that first shot of her hand slapping down on the ground did not get your juices flowing ?	1
that ' s what the next ones are for . ^	1
yea , no one wants introspection and soul - searching ! give us more things blowing up and add in some transforming robots !	1
i do not know , the 45 minutes of barbara going after rapey fonz wasn ' t that bad .	1
heavy	1
great , now i know that something happens in the last episodes of the show ! thanks , asshole	1
wow , they dressed everybody up really really well . i am sure this movie will be the shit	1
like the one where terry pratchett contacted a physician for assisted - suicide , sent an eerie tweet before he naturally died and the physician he was working with beforehand verified that he died naturally and not at all via assisted - suicide .	1
because deep down inside , we wanted amon goeth to win and get the girl .	1
i have been poring over <allcaps> imdb </allcaps> and i got nothin ' .	1
josh brolin , eh ? there definitely will not be any thanos - related jokes in this movie .	1
no , it does not matter how forced it is . shoehorn it in . <allcaps> everything </allcaps> is about equality nowadays .	1
that just means you are drinking it too slow	1
yes because the chinese would have absolutely hated the movie if jet li kissed aaliyah .	1
while we are at it let us make a jar jar binks movie too !	1
and who would have thought it only took the end of the world for that to happen .	1
you forgot to include emma stone	1
that ' s because white people have white trash weighing them down . <repeated>	1
those crazy asians do not know how whitewashed the garbage they are cramming down their throats is !	1
what do you mean ? the generic hollywood orchestral bwaamms <elongated> during the spider tank scenes were so <elongated> good	1
oh wow . this has me pumped . turtle necks and plaid suits are so badass . especially when dudes are sitting in chairs looking angry . wow . so pumped .	1
so	1
well , i suppose in dcs defence , most avengers costumes are cgi	1
you are missing the point here . thor ' s hair is different ! this is a bold and fearless movie .	1
dude , spoilers !	1
yeah , normally people have to lie about cate blanchett looking hot	1
this is bullshit , fucking critics are so stuck in the past ! like there ' s no movies from the 2 0 0 0 s here at all , disgusting bias !	1
he ' s a really underrated director . have you heard of the film memento ? it ' s probably the most underrated movie of all time , right next to in bruges .	1
sorry idiot his next film takes place in world war ii	1
yeah , but it was shot on 1 6 mm black and white film !	1
yeah , man , that never get ' s old ! <allcaps> lol </allcaps> ! <repeated> 11 ! <repeated> one !	1
what are you talking about . max height sounds like a great title for a hollywood blockbuster	1
cause he ' s the oldest and everyone knows smurf hierarchy is based heavily on facial hair to assert adult status .	1
* the arrival * staring charlie sheen	1
yeah i remember the flood of horror films that came out after that one with the found footage gimmick	1
thanks a lot for the spoilers , guys . now we know she does not die in part 8 .	1
proving once again that the power of song and dance . <repeated> turns men gay	1
is he still alive ? last i heard was that hillary killed him with her devil powers .	1
spoiler much ? ! <repeated>	1
what ? she did not like johny depp playing a native american ?	1
no we are not .	1
i am amazed that they got so many quality comedians and they were all named peter sellers . what are the odds of that happening ?	1
become a coal miner ! those jobs are coming back .	1
but guys . <repeated> what if ep 8 bombs ?	1
you do not understand . it was filmed over a period of 12 years . that means it ' s amazing and deserves praise .	1
november 1st 2021 ? i can not wait that long !	1
bold move , disney , filming a * star wars * sequel before * the last jedi * is released .	1
yeah , if they did not show the alien in the marketing materials then nobody would know what it looks like , and it would be a surprise !	1
yeah , as a balding man i took it super personally and it cut me deeply when hannibal lector was portrayed with thinning hair .	1
bro do you love nirvana too ? ! <repeated> they make the best shirts !	1
so between you and the other guy this movie could have made 15 pounds ? ! <repeated> you are why they do not make indie films !	1
can not wait for the sequel	1
should have casted rhonda roussey	1
but what about deadpool ?	1
poor d.c. , this role is so difficult . so happy he finally gets to end it . i know it was a difficult choice .	1
yeah but he ' s asian so that ' s ok	1
yea , this movie certainly does not look like crap .	1
will ferrell runs his shows well	1
yeah , but the trailer does not spoil the whole movie , right guys ?	1
i feel the same . i read an interview with scarlett about the movie where she denies whitewashing and says the controversy is really over her supporting women ' s reproductive rights . so she ' s really stretching to reflect any blame off her . what she does not realize is , like you said , could affect actresses getting blockbuster leads because if ghost fails then it must be because she ' s a woman .	1
so do you guys think moonlight ' s good ?	1
he did not say he loved you or your post . he just said he loved reddit . you are being presumptuous and clingy , op . ew .	1
well that ' s just average female form .	1
what are you doing not posting prequel memes ? ! <repeated> get outta here	1
r / hailcorporate	1
guess you had the wrong type of mental health issue	1
um . <repeated> gonna need a source on the original pic . <repeated> for science	1
